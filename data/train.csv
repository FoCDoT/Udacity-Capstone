1,1,1,some additional information that we would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be placed in each identical container how or what tool to use to measure the mass of the four different samples and how much distilled water to use to rinse the four samples after taking them out of the vinegar
2,1,1,after reading the expirement i realized that the additional information you need to replicate the expireiment is one the amant of vinegar you poured in each container two label the containers before you start yar expirement and three write a conclusion to make sure yar results are accurate
3,1,1,what you need is more trials a control set up and an exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup beaker you could also take and check the mass every 30 min or 1 hour
4,1,0,the student should list what rock is better and what rock is the worse in the procedure
5,1,2,for the students to be able to make a replicate they would need to tell use how much vinegar is used and what tipe of materials is needed for the expirement
6,1,1,i would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers and what are they drying into
7,1,1,the information i would need in order to sucessfully replicate the experiment is the correct measurement they used for the experiment also the materials that was used to creat the experiament after the 24 hours of removing the samples from the container and rinsen each sample with distilled water making it dry for 30 mintued might not be long enough to really determine the mass of each sample especially when you have more than one different samples to do with different texture
8,1,3,you would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment you would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure you would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container you would also need to know exactly how to mass the samples and what types of container to use plastic for example might alter the results
9,1,3,some additional information you will need are the material you also need to know the size of the contaneir to measure how the acid rain effected it you need to know how much vineager is used for each sample another thing that would help is to know how big the sample stones are by measureing the best possible way
10,1,2,inorder to replicate the experiment we will need to add information such as sticlenx statement of what the four samples are and how many pieces you will need as well as the amount of vinegar bring poured into the containers and the instruments you will need to retrieve when determining mass however revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required
11,1,0,an additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
12,1,3,the additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples also you would need to know the kind of vinegar in a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers
13,1,2,there are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are also the procedure does not specify how much vinigar to pour for each container a good procedure would have specified this
14,1,2,in order the replicate the experiment you need
15,1,0,well what i understand about this procedure is that you take four samples put them in different containers that look the same put vinegar on every sample finally rinse them out with normal water let them sit for 30 minutes till they dry then your finally going to see the difference between those samples
16,1,0,i don't know what is going on
17,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the shape of each material because the amount of surface area expand to the vinegar mass changes the results i would also need to know how much vinegar and what size containers to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment
18,1,0,the additional information i would need is to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain after that i will have to come up with my dependent and independent variables so i can tell and see each one is different in mass i will organize the data to see if the information is accurate then i will write the conclusion to see if my hypothesis was correct and to see if my results were correct
19,1,0,in order to replicate this experiment i would need a scare in order to get the mass next i would need tape and markers to label the containers last i would need all 4 samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment
20,1,3,in order for the me to replicate their procedure i would need to know what four samples they used they should include that in their procedure also they should stay where you are to put the four containers during the 24 hour time period finally they should include what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do this experiment i would in as close to what they actually did and therefore would be able to replicate the experiment
21,1,0,you would need to have four seperate but identical containers you would also need to pour in each of them vinegar to determine the mass of the items being placed in them and new items would be needed to be placed in each of the containers
22,1,2,inorder to replicate the experiment i would need to know the mass of the four different samples how much vinegar to pour into the containers what the samples were made up of and how much water to rinse them with after the 24 hours
23,1,0,the students data needed to include how much of the solution was poored they also needed to find out if the rocks weighed the same when they started
24,1,3,for this experiments duplication you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup you would also have to know how big in size each container was additionally you would need to know the size of each sample to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly
25,1,1,some additional information that i would need is the amount of vinegar they poured
26,1,2,after reading the groups procedure i would need to know what type of vinegar they were using because it could of been any type what was the measure of containers because the containers could have been 3 different sizes and they wouldn't have valid results and they also should have told me what they were holding constant because i wouldn't know what variables to use or control
27,1,2,they needed to include what time they started and when they ended also the amount of vinegar they used also the size of each sample
28,1,0,1 get 4 different samples marble limestone wood plastic p 2 put each sample into 4 different containers p 3 pour vinegar in each of 4 separate but identical containers p 4 after 24 hrs remove the samples from the container and rinse each w distilled water p 5 allow samples to sit and dry for 30 min p 6 determine the data of each sample p 7 record your data
29,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the samples were in this group's procedure they do not state what
30,1,2,in step three you would need to know how much of each sample to use also in step to you need to fill each container with the same amount step 4 you must rinse each stone as much also there is no control variable
31,1,2,i additional information that i would need to replicate the experiment is to add where your going to leave the samples for 24 hours another one that they would need to add in order for me to replicate the experiment is to clearly state the independent variable i would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each seperate but identical container
32,1,0,you will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dryed up
33,1,3,for this experiment you would actually need to know what each ''sample'' is the amount of vinegar that was used and the size of each ''sample''
34,1,3,to replicate the experiment i would need to know the samples that i will be using i would also need to know how much vinegar to use i would also need to know what type of containers to use
35,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour you need to know how much distilled water and you aso need to know how your going to weigh it
36,1,2,well i would need to know what the problem statement is i would need to know what type of cups we are using i would need to know the amount of vinegar we are using and i would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ
37,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of each material is used before i go and find the mass i would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure
38,1,0,i will need to know what's the purpose for this experiment know the difference in mass for each sample and i need to know an esimate of what they thought the starting and ending mass was
39,1,1,they should add how much vinegar to add to each sample for this lab to be more accurate they should have also added more trials as well as adding a constant variable such as a rock in just water
40,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know first how to calculate the mass of the samples i would also need t o know what the four samples are as if is not stated in the procedure lastly to repeat this expirement i would need to know how much vinegar was placed into each container
41,1,1,additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment what materials are going to be used and how much of each material will be used
42,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in the container you also need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in also you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water
43,1,3,after reading the procedure i would first need to know what the for sample are that i am testing second i p would need to know how much vinegar put in each container next the procedure should tell me how thing to case rinse each sample in distiled water
44,1,3,determine what the different samples are then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample state how long you are rising the materials in water ex 5 minutes
45,1,2,in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need a lot of additional information first of all i would need to know what it is that they are using as the four samples rocks bark
46,1,0,i think the experiment should make the description more specific so as not to be confused and mistake cups for instance they could say each of the cork samples and place sample into cup labeled 'a'
47,1,2,one extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each containers the words a sample doesn't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed a repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results
48,1,0,there could be more than 1 test for each sample there could also have a constant added to the expariement also there are to softy instanchings in the experiment like put on goggles before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar
49,1,0,they should take more notes that way in case they mess up they can have a the information how to redo it
50,1,3,how much vinager should you pour with what label and when to sit it it sitand dry for 30 min label the container's reapetedly separate but identicle conatainer what containers should we use
51,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the different mauterials were i would also need to know how many different materials there were and what the starting mass of each material was
52,1,0,in the experiment i would determine the mas of each sample pair the vinegar into a container then label i would wait 24 hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water let the samples dry and find the mass difference
53,1,2,in order to complete this experiment three aditional thing should be included the first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup the second is to list the far samples in the procedure the third is to record the information obtained
54,1,2,in order to replicate the group's i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four and how long containers how much the sample you need to add you need to rinse the samples
55,1,2,the procedure needs to state the four types of samples it is using marbles limestone wood plastic you need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup you need a set amount you could also do the time at different times so you could do it at is at 30 and at 45 minutes to see if there is a change at all in the mass over time
56,1,1,the information i would need to replicate the experiment is the four different samples the four identical containers the amount of time to let the samples sit and the product to rinse the samples with so i could let them sit for more
57,1,0,to repeat this experiment you would need to get the average that was used in the last procedure and let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass
58,1,2,we need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container to make sure that each sample fair results we also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable we also need to know what kind and how big the containers are because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes
59,1,3,some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material we need to know how big the sample would have to be something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in is it room temperature we need to know this
60,1,3,to replicate the experiment the procedure would require more detail one piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment it is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours finally the procedure needs to include details about the experiment for example if the whole sample must be submerged
61,1,1,you would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps that because the experiment only tell you to pour vinegar but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put
62,1,3,this group left same very important thing out of their procedure first of all they didn't tell us what sumples to use for the experiment they didn't tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab
63,1,1,you would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data write down you need to record the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
64,1,0,some additional information i would need is how they found the mass and what type of instrument was being used also when they say place a sample of the material how much of each type am i going to need
65,1,0,first of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them use the same weight of each sample
66,1,0,to exactly replicate this experiment you would have to know how they measured the mass of the object because without that how would we figure out the different masses we have to know the starting mass the ending mass and the difference in mass
67,1,1,after reading the group' procedure i did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers this group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar this group also did not state the reason the data they just said to determine it
68,1,2,i would need the amount of roch in each container i would need the amount of vinegar of r container i would need the same kind of vinegar in each container i would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant i would also need the amount trials done
69,1,3,1 a list of materials and safety requirements p 2 the amount of vinegar to put in the containers p 3 the temperature of the room vineger p 4 a control group
70,1,1,additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group a control grap should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample we also would need to know
71,1,1,what you would need is the imformation on how much vinegar is added to every sample for example one sample can be in a different amount of vinegar so that can throw their ending masses off
72,1,2,we would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say samples we need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with they would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams
73,1,0,what the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples so what i would do what they did in the beginning or the investigation i would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples
74,1,1,on statement 2 they need to put the measurement of the containers p on statmen 4 how much water p on number 6 whats the measuremt were suppost to use for the mass
75,1,1,some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container also make sure the times are all on for each sample also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass
76,1,3,in order to replicate ta experiment a person would need to know a few more things they would need to know which substances to use how much of each one the person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container they would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in one might also want to know what type of container how to write down the findings
77,1,3,you would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container what type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment
78,1,0,additional pieces of information that shuld be included in the procedure would be with with what would you be using to determine the mass such as a scale have the controlled variable evident in the procedure one last thing that should be to move a table of the starting mass the endingmass and the difference in mass using grams
79,1,1,to replicate this experiment you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container you would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples also you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same
80,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know 3 more things that weren't stated in the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container the amount of time the samples were in the vinegar and the amount of distilled water used to rinse it off
81,1,3,the additional things that i would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in i would also include the samples of what i am testing in the experiment lastly i would also put in my procedure how much amount of vinegar they are putting in
82,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you must be able to know what the four materials are how to measure the mass how much vinegar should be poured into the containers and how much distilled water should they rinse it with they should start by saying d determine the mass put the tripple beam balance of the four diff samples name them then pour vinegar how much into containers then these step of step 4 wash how much distilled water and it would be better
83,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the containers that you would place the sample in you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass for example tripple beam balance etc and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the containers
84,1,0,you got to put more vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more vinegar so it could do more reaction
85,1,1,another trials the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it's accurate because if not youill change the experiment by changing the most important things
86,1,3,to replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure first we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers enough to cover them next we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material will we completely submerge it or only partially finally we need to know which materials to use the data indicates them but the procedure does not
87,1,0,three additional pieces of information i would need to replicate the procedure are to gather materials use a control and when it's finish to record the data
88,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more piecesof information one of them being the amount of each material wood plastic marble and limestone you would also need to know how much vinegar to add finally a constant for each material would alsohelp
89,1,0,the independent varriable is the imarble limestone wood plastic the marble starting point was 9 8g the limestone was 10 4g and wood starting point 11 2 the end of the exeperiment is that you have to determine the mass of each sample
90,1,2,additional information that could be useful in order to replicate the experiment would be to list the actual samples in the procedure so you can see what your using secondly in the procedures i nade need to what to weigh the mass in for example they didn't tell you to weigh in grams and i wouldn't be able to complete the experiment easily it doesn't tell how much vinegar to actually pour into each container in order to replicate i would need to know that
91,1,3,i think that knowing the temperature in the envoment would be very useful i'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples we wouldn't get the same results also we need to know what type of environment we should place this in should it be sunny dark windy hot cold etc i also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be we don't even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples this experiment is missing too much information
92,1,0,in order for i for replicate this expirement i woukd need to know what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of result are being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of expirment theie results
93,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container you would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water you would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in
94,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment we would need a control we would also need the four samples to use and another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one that is what we would need to replicate the experiment
95,1,3,the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container the amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid the results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar was increased or decreased therefore the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment
96,1,0,in order to replicate this groups procedure you would need to know the independent and dependent variables as well as the control group for the procedure also to ma ke it more clear they would need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose
97,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment the procedure would have to add more details in the first bullet the four samples should be stated as marble limestone wood and plastic you should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need there should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added one last thing is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say in grams
98,1,1,they should have told the samples that was used the second thing was the outcome what happened to the differ
99,1,3,the students need to say what the samples are they need to
100,1,2,the group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control also they should have compared at least one more trial material before reply 2conclusion the recommended sizes of the samples should have also been stated in order for the conclusion to be easy to compare with other group attempting to complete this experiment
101,1,3,additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples in step 2 i would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container also in step 4 i would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long
102,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment some additional information i would need is how the grap determined the mass of the samples and what did they use to do so i would also need to know the amount of vinegar they used to pour in each container as well as what kind of containers they used
103,1,1,first off these groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container in step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different marble limestone wood plastic the students also forgot to include step 7 which is find the differences in mass if another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldn't know what they are comparing
104,1,2,if i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp of the room i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used
105,1,0,after reading the groups procedure the following additional information is needed you need to observe the containers when you fill each with the content you will need to make sure each container has the very same amount then also make sure that all the containers are in the same room temp
106,1,1,the additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut also you need to record all the information they need to know how much water they are putting into the containers after 24 hours
107,1,2,you would need the size of the container amount of vinegar used the types of samples such as earth wood limestone and plastic and how much of each to put in
108,1,3,in addition to the information given you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container different amounts could change the results there should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at because change in temperature can affect the corossion process in the experiment it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size
109,1,1,additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the measur ments of the liquids poured into the cups also wat size cups are the liquids poured into in the procedure it says pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers that is the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment
110,1,0,some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put 4 in the vinegar
111,1,0,for each box they should have done it 3 times so they would have an average
112,1,1,i would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment what should i be looking for when experiment is going on how do i determine the mas of each sement
113,1,1,some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the proceeduce include what type of samples your using also do explain why you are using vinegar finally to tell the reader what your weighing with and why
114,1,2,if i was to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container the size of the containers and what was used to weigh the samples
115,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the containers were kept room temperature outside etc
116,1,0,in order to replicate this this experiment youwould need the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
117,1,2,you would need to find out and label the different sizes and shapes of the 4 samples you don't pour the vinegar in instead you say to drops in each container you want everything to be the same and when you pour you don't always get the exact amount for each container also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar
118,1,0,your going to need how much is there in total
119,1,0,pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers p place one sample in a conteiner and do the same for the rest p after 24 hrs remove sample and rinse p sit and drt for 30 min p determine the mles
120,1,2,to replicate this experiment you would need to know the mass amount of vinegar used in each cup it is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in a different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup the last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment the volume of the cup and or the shape of the cup could completely alter the results of the experiment
121,1,1,to replicate the experiment i would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared i would also be more specific on the word samples to describe rocks and stones and most importantly i would make a control i would put marble limestone wood and plastic in water
122,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need some additional information first of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar
123,1,1,what you would need to know to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup also you would need to list the materials you were using another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use
124,1,1,you would need what semples there what you do after number 6
125,1,0,it would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data also a total of the data could have been better too
126,1,3,first you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about next you would need to know how much vinegar you need to put in each container you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample
127,1,0,the additional information i would need to radicate the experiment i would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment i would put after 24 hours remove the samples from the container rinse each sample w distilled water allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes instead of putting determine the mass of each sample i would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out
128,1,0,i will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are the sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight
129,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment a control would need to be established also a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment in order to accurately replicate this experiment it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours
130,1,3,we would word correct safety measures to take the control the effect of vinegar what temperature to store them at what the identical containers are made of and its size what type of scale to use to meas it the amount of vinegar in each container i more trials
131,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment there are a few more things i need to know the problem does not state what the four different samples are second i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup the amount of vinegar could impact the mass last i would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period different tempuratures might affect the different samples
132,1,2,this question would need to include the measurement of the containers the amount of vinegar poured in each cup
133,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what she containers to use and how to measure the mass of the samples i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container
134,1,0,you would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment or not usin enough or too much may not give you the same results
135,1,3,in order to replicate the lab the students did you would need to know what materials were need what kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples
136,1,2,the additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used also they should include how much vinegar we need to pour into the container because different amounts could have different results lastly it should include the size of the container because it could have a different result
137,1,2,additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step what the samples are going to be it would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar it would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples it would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test
138,1,3,after reading the group's procedure additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in for they need to be identical u also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight
139,1,3,some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit such as in the sun or in the refrigerator how much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using
140,1,2,the students should say in the experiment what samples are being used they should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup
141,1,2,three additional pieces of information that i would need to know to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of how much vinegar to pour into each container and what exactly the purpose or problem statement for this experiment was also how much distilled water i would need to use
142,1,2,in the procedure i would also need to know how much vinegar to use which scale of measure they are using and how big each container is
143,1,3,in order to complete this experiment you would need additional information you would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment you would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors you might also need to know to know the constants what type of vinegar and what time you started
144,1,3,to replicate this experiment you would also need to know vinergar they used the size of the cup and the the size of the samples
145,1,2,after reading the procedure there were a few things i need to know to replicate the experiment one thing is the amount of vinegar used another is how much water to use when rinsing it the last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours there were a few problems with this procedure
146,1,3,i would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not it would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into
147,1,1,i need to know how big the container is how many of them
148,1,2,what are the samples what is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers
149,1,0,the students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen also they should have stated what they were investigating they should have made a conclusion from the results
150,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers what tools to use such as safety goggles and having more trials
151,1,1,they needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determined they need to tell you to table the containers and you need to record tour data
152,1,2,some additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do i put in each container also what am i supposed to label the container i'm not quite sure how to measure the mass by using a scale if so the same scale for each sample also how big are the samples sapposed to be
153,1,3,to replicate this experiment you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup the temperature of the surroundings and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale
154,1,0,to replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid
155,1,2,you would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container i think the students should have started out with the same mass what type of vinegar and does temperature matters
156,1,0,some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar also maybe not have then sit for 24 hours but hav then sit less they could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water
157,1,2,the additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are p 1 the amount of vinegar to pour this must remain constant in a credible experiment p 2 the types of samples used should be in the procedure p 3
158,1,1,to replicate the experiment you would need to find out how much vinegar to pour into the containers we know that marble lost 4 grams limestone lost 1 3 grams plastic lost 1 grams and wood stayed the same but we need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample
159,1,0,we had all the information we need to do the experiment we allready know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to complete the mass because it looks like they only have estimates for the mass
160,1,2,the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment you'd also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container
161,1,1,to replicate the groups procedure i would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers how much of one sample material do they want and how they want us to determine the mass
162,1,1,there are a couple additions that should be made to replicate the lab accurately in procedure 1 it does not say to measure the mass of the samples wi or without a petri dish it also should say that they should be measured with a particular instrument such as balance beam another part that was left out was that they forgot to tell how much vinegar the four samples need because if one gets more than another it might change the weight and how much water torince the samples with
163,1,1,you would need to tel what type of samples they are also what type of untensil to use to measure the mass of the samples also would need repeat or replicating trials to re test the experiment or you ll also need to tell what to label the containers by in this experiment you 'll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results
164,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what kind of ''samples'' i am using the group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample i should measure again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible to know how much of the sample i should be using finally in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i should add to each sample different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently making the experiment inaccurate
165,1,2,in order to be able to duplicate this experiment you need the following information how much vinegar to use also how big are the containers i e what is what is their volume and lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers
166,1,1,additional information i would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample this is because if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would
167,1,0,in order to deplicate this experiment you would need to state exectly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour in most cases it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be difficient
168,1,3,to repeat this experiment i would need to know the four different samples without knowing that i don't know what i'm testing i also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups i would need to know where to put all of the different containers i don't know if they need to stay at room temp cold or not
169,1,0,you should repeat each step in the experiment start with step 1 and go all the way to step 6
170,1,1,to replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers you would also need to know when you started to know when to finish the experiment
171,1,1,what materials should we use because inorder to do this experiment it has to tell us what sudstances are being used their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight
172,1,2,after reading the group's procedure in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the size of the containers because the smaller the container the more densely packed the samples are i would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experiments
173,1,1,the procedure has to be more specific it should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end it should have materials listed it should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material
174,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used because i could have choosen metal carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results also i would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change lastly they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp or by a light source makes a difference too
175,1,1,to replicate the experiment they would need to tell you how much vinnegar to put in the cups have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment
176,1,2,to replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples
177,1,2,these students procedure was not a reliable one the material needed to mention what kind of material they uses is there only reducing to ism the sample they also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup the material also that not include in control groups which is a centered post or any experiment they student variable unchecked they also included only the trial
178,1,1,i would need to know the amount of vinegar added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment
179,1,2,the additional information i would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using in step 1 it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples but doesn't tell me which kind in step 2 it tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container after sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours i need to find the mass of each sample step 6 but they don t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf
180,1,1,the group needs to add what to label because
181,1,0,first i woule say you need to get all materials before you do any of that what would we use to get the masses of the 4 different materials and where woule we place the 4 containers while we are waiting for the results
182,1,3,first you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers you would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of lastly they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun in a dry cold place etc
183,1,2,in step 1 we need to know what samples it should list the 4 types of rock p in step 4 how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given p in step 6 it should say to correct the new mass of each sample
184,1,1,the procedure is not clear they need to say the sample names because we don't know what it is also they need to say why to measure the mass of the four different samples before putting it in the vinegar finally they should repeat the experiment a several times so to see the difference and maybe they should keep the sample in the container for a longer time to see the results
185,1,0,we would need observations during the whole experiment maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed also try another sample
186,1,2,the experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure for example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described the method of determining the mass as well as the four sample materials has not been specified in the procedural information
187,1,1,1 i would have to know what kind of area i would have to leave it in for 24 hours temperature p 2 i would have to know what kind of wood to use if there has any specific p 3 also in step 6 it does not say what i have to use to determine the mass of the rocks plastic and wood
188,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you need to know what the samples are taken of what size the samples should be what size the containers should be and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample
189,1,0,in this group's procedure some additional information should've been what were the labels named
190,1,2,additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar you would also need to know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use
191,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment i belive that the information wanted would be the starting rows ending mass and difference in mass the additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedure i f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples
192,1,0,i think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph
193,1,0,in the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone rock plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them they could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one marble limestone wood and plastic in the procedure it only explained after 24hrs but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time
194,1,1,after reading the groups procedure i found 2 more additional pieces of informotins so that i can duplicate the experiments i need to know the independent variable dependent variadle and how much vinegar to pour into each seperate containers
195,1,3,after reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample the last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be
196,1,3,the additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample in order to find the mass of only the sample you need to subtract the mass of the container also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample i also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when i am waiting 24 hours lastly i need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react
197,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment the person performing it should do a few things differently first they should state what materials they are using second they should have a set measurement of how much vinegar to pour into each container and third they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending masses
198,1,1,need to know how much vinigar to put in each container how you are going to get the mass of the sample and how they are going to calculate the difference should be included in the students procedure
199,1,3,to replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water the size of the container would be essential as well so you would know how much vinegar should be used
200,1,0,additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be for the group to explain how to determine the mass of the materials to find out what the starting mass was to explain more specifically how to place the materials in separate containers for less confusion and to explain how you find the ending mass and the difference in mass
201,1,0,you would need more marble limestone wood and plastic
202,1,1,you would need the amount of vineger the samples sat in the amount of water they where rinsed in and the amount of each sample
203,1,0,i don't know what replicate means so i don't know how to anser this question
204,1,3,first it doesn't tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers next it doesn't say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes maybe they need a cover for it but we don't know from this information in addition there is an information about how they determined the mass
205,1,2,in the group's procedure three things need to do is tell how much vinegar should be poured in the containers how much of a sample should be added and what conditions the containers were placed in for the 24 hours
206,1,3,1 what kind of sample of material are you using 2 how much vinegar should we put in the containers 3 they should be more clear about how to rinse each sample
207,1,2,i need to know how much vinegar i need to pour on each of pour seperate but dentical containers i need to know what the four different samples are
208,1,0,in order to replicate experiment acid rain'' you will need get four seperate but identical containers the materials marble limestone wood and plastic after you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container after you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container after 24 hours rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again
209,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container also i would need to know of each sample was are solid piece or n small or pieces the greas would need to identify
210,1,1,they would have to add put each four different sample in four separate but identical containers in which you poured the vinegar butthey have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four identical containers
211,1,3,the procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment there should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup the group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off decreasing the mass the group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size
212,1,0,tools
213,1,2,a desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment the it would also be helpful to determine why this experiment was being performed as well as knowing if the samples were covered or not and how much vinegar to use
214,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are the experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without the experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain that may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab also the lab should have said what type of container wether it is a beaker test tube or a different type of container
215,1,2,to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to i would need to also know which type of container to use
216,1,2,one piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure they repeat over and over about different samples but never once tell you what they were the second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass ending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample finally the 3rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used
217,1,1,the additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do i leave the containers after i finish putting all the samples into different containers
218,1,1,additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass what are the samples marble limestone wood and plastic and how to find the different in mass
219,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers how ling to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water i think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass therefore ruining the experiment also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass so i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing
220,1,0,the group would need to put in the materials more information on what to do and add the measurement into be a good procedure
221,1,2,the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment is how many ml of vinigars are poured to each four seperate containers not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled and what are the four different samples these are information's i need to replicate the procedure
222,1,2,the first thing is why the students are doing this experiment then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar put in each container the student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials
223,1,1,first they should of put the amount of vinegar being used they don't say to record there data
224,1,2,additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following p 1 explain what the four different samples would be p 2 explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup p 3 another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples p 4 indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples
225,1,0,i
226,1,1,in order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used in this experiment they used marble limestone wood plastic the second step is to find the mass of the four samples then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment thats how i would do this experiment over
227,1,1,we would need to know what the investigation was need to know what kined of sample their talking about what they used to determine the mass all of this information will help the reader help understaned the investigation better
228,1,3,you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the containers what order to put samples in take them out allat once and how long to rinse for
229,1,2,you would need to know how much vinegar was used how much distilled water was used and what kind of containers were used
230,1,0,the students still need to make a hypothesis a graph and find the difference in mass
231,1,2,one piece of information i would need to know in order to replicate the group's procedure is how much of each sample did they put into each vinegar filled container i would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container i would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples if i used different amounts of water when washing the samples one may not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results
232,1,2,some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar do we pour into the containers how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rinse the samples with distilled water
233,1,0,you need limestone and marble
234,1,1,the information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area what type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass
235,1,0,in order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial and also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a tv and dv content they also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
236,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i need to know the materials what kind of sample material and why are they doing the experiment how much vinegar rinse or how long
237,1,0,determine the ending mass determine the difference in mass also the mass or everything marble limestone wood and plastic you would need to add up all three masses starting ending and the difference in mass then you will get the answer to all of them
238,1,1,the steps that this procedure is missing would be to list gather all materials because you need to know what you are working with 2nd say how much vinegar to pour into the containers the other part that this procedure is misssing is how much distilled water do you rinse each sample with if you don't have this information it would make the experiment very off with validity's the containers wouldn't be the same
239,1,3,the group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made limestone wood 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples'' they also say determine the mass of that substances but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass scale they need to say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with and how
240,1,2,you would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate finally you would need to know how to measure the mass of the samples what instrument to use
241,1,3,to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2 in step 4 a person would need to know the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in in step 3 the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure the actual names of each of the materials should be given temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well
242,1,2,i would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container what four types of materials we need for the experiment to know that we need to find the difference between the masses of the materials before and after the experiment in order replicate the experiment
243,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you will need amount of vinegar used the size of the container and and the amount of time used for each step of the experiment these are 3 three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment
244,1,2,some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it
245,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things one thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment i would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers lastly i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples
246,1,0,the additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample the limestone sample and the wood sample and the plastic sample i would follow the procedure step by step
247,1,1,additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting including writing down the data in the experiment make step 3 to separate steps also how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each containers
248,1,1,first you would need a control the absence of what is effecting the dependant in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar this group had don't write down the amount of vinegar its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment they should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable
249,1,2,there is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment i need to know what the four starting samples are also this procedure needs to include weigh the samples i need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample lastly at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight
250,1,1,three aditional peace of information you need is what typ of vinegar and at what ph also the lb of the samples
251,1,0,you would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion
252,1,3,they need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after 24 hours
253,1,1,what additional information that may be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment also the amount of vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup however including information about time wouldn't hart the econ't either
254,1,3,1 firstly the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are how big they are what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment p 2 the group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container how much is needed p 3 the group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container even though this is just vinegar their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab goggle inclusion would also be rise
255,1,2,the procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing they need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format the way of massing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be massed sepparately
256,1,3,additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container how long do you rinse the samples do the samples stay outside or inside day or night
257,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information what are four samples you would need to know that so the experiment will be the same they should also include the amount of vinegar that you need the last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container
258,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers also i would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment and finally i need to know if it is weighed in grams pounds or any other measurement
259,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate containers you would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container the last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the containers and make sure its the same type of sample you used at any time
260,1,2,the additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment the amount of vinegar to put in the containers the different samples they used needs to be stated in procedures and the amount of the sample placed in the container
261,1,0,you would need to add observations you would also need to add the time on the table
262,1,0,the additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers you would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar you will also need to have 4 containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container
263,1,0,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the mass of it with the distilled water
264,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble limestone wood and the plastic pour the vinegar into their containers place the materials into the containers and wait 24 hours may be the mass will be differet may be it will be the same
265,1,3,there is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment first i would need to know what the four different samples are second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers third i would need to know what type of container i should use last i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours these are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment
266,1,1,the other information i would need to replicate this experiment is what do we use for the samples how much each samples do we use and how do we determine the mass of each sample
267,1,1,after reading this group's procedure i found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup this information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test the data obtained from a replication of this experiment it would be false and the procedure couln't be replicated therefore it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment
268,1,1,the first thing that i would need in order to replicate the acid rain experiment is my 4 different samples the next thing i will need is the vinegar to pour on our 4 samples the last thing i need is a slaceal to measure the start mass g and the ending mass g to find out the difference in mass g
269,1,0,i guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht like allow to dry in 30 min 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers 3 go over to make sure nothing goes wrong
270,1,3,the students need to include what the samples were you can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on the students should also include the temp that the containers were stored at for 24 hours lastly they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container they could've put the same amount or different amount they could've put little or a lot
271,1,2,the addition information that i would need is how many steps we will need to do to get data what is the best container to put the sample in and does it have to be the sume kind of container i would also need how much many times you need to rinse the sample
272,1,1,in order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the ph of the vinegar how much vinegar was used for each samples and specifics such as the type of material used ie balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic
273,1,1,to replicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use you need to know how large the samples are and you need to know why you are doing the experiment
274,1,1,if trying to replicate this experiment you would need more information you need to know how much vinegar to poor into the containers you will also need to know what to label your container how do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment you need to make sure that you have all of the correct information before starting your project
275,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the materials your using this procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar
276,1,1,the students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples they also didn't specify how much of each sample they also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went
277,1,2,some additional information that's needed in order to replicate this experiment are the names kinds of each sample the measurements of each sample poured into the containers and the amount of vinegar poured into each container as well
278,1,1,some information that is missing that they don't say what size of containers and they don't say what to do with data
279,1,1,in order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used and if it is the same for all of them you would also need to do another trial as the extra information would validate the experiment more
280,1,1,to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vineger is being poured in i would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container weather or not all of it or half of it should be added
281,1,3,to tell the amount vinger you pour into the container the size of the container ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water how many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass
282,1,1,this procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials first it has to say to put on their eye protection it also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples lastly there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results
283,1,0,1 say what you are trying figure out in the first place p 2 it's not enough into figure out what is going on p 3 we need to know more clearly how to do each step
284,1,1,first i would add that the students might want to add a list of materials that they need a hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out
285,1,1,in order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup they also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed if there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid
286,1,2,they did not tell us what to measure with they also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of containers
287,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would also need materials i would use i would need the amount of vinegar in the container and i would also need time limit to do the test
288,1,0,some information i would need to know is how would the water be if
289,1,2,to replicate this experiment i would need to know more information i would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen also i don't know how much vinegar to pore in each cup this procedure also should specify what materials to use line what brand of cups or size
290,1,1,the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers they also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample
291,1,3,first they should list the samples they used marble limestone wood and plastic in their procedure they should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect they should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet as a refrigerator or somthing not just leaving it out of their processes
292,1,0,in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp by hour bic it's recorded after a 24 har period you would also need to know the mass before it was left to ary for 30 mins
293,1,1,to add to the experiment design the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables following this you will
294,1,1,additials information that would be good to now is why are the students performing this xpirement why arent there cups a for measures for distiled water amounts or vinegar amounts you should also know why the starting mass for the materials all arent the same
295,1,1,to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar i would get different results
296,1,0,you will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water you will probably need more of a little bit of everything
297,1,1,the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass which would be a triple beam balance you would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3 you would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are those samples would be marble limestone wood and plastic
298,1,2,in order to replicate the group's experement i would need the following information what the 4 samples are how much vinegar to put into each containers and how much of each sample
299,1,1,the information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis secondly they need to list all objects they used lastly they need to state weather their hypothesis was wasn't correct
300,1,1,the group of students should add a control to see the different between the samples and the control in the experiment procedure also doesn't put the different samples of four like marble limestone wood plastic the purpose of this experiment should be a group of student what is the different samples of the mass of flour after let them dry for a certain time
301,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to know the size of the containers the amount of each material to start with and the amount of vinegar used
302,1,3,i would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container how long to rinse it in water materials and what kind of container casinial use
303,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you must also know how much vinegar goes in each container how the mass is being determined and where the containers should be put for the 24 hours what type of climate
304,1,1,to duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the replicate experiment is identical making it move accurate
305,1,2,the additional information that i need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples i also need to know how much vinegar is needed furthermore i need to know the amount of each sample needed finally this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample
306,1,0,to replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time
307,1,2,their are three things wrong with this procedure one is they did not table the four identical containers the second is they need to tell how much vinegar is needed the third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water
308,1,1,to replicate the experiment i would need to know what to do to the control also i would need to know how much vinegar needed to give into each separate containers lastly i would have mll of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed
309,1,2,one piece of information that would be helpful to know is how much vinegar do we put in the container another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit and lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark
310,1,0,you will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container after the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse have the samples sit and dry for 30 min
311,1,2,additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled
312,1,1,you would need the information to know how much vinegar to pour into the container the information to know which sample had the greatest difference in mass and the information to which material to use in step 3
313,1,3,three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment first is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples the next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment
314,1,1,this experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same
315,1,0,the information the students left out was the control the control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples
316,1,1,additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar also the experiment doesn't say how to remove the materials from the vinegar
317,1,0,after reading this procedure i think it would need task needed tell what it is you are doing and what solution and a hypothesis
318,1,1,the first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i e the procedure to gather materials this lets people know what materials your using also this procedure wasn't worded clearly like 2 pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers that makes no sense and is hard to understand they also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples
319,1,2,the additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used
320,1,1,they didn't include the temperature of the containers they didn't have trials of testing
321,1,2,you would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry
322,1,3,the group should be more specific including the names of the samples add rain sample1 2 etc they should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2 in step 4 they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container
323,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass also i need to know what should i do with the containers once i've labeled them the experiment's results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them you don't know what to do lastly how much water should i rinse the samples with if different amounts are used the weight could differ
324,1,2,if i a just looking at the people and i was to repeta this experiment i would need to know what the four different samples were does the distilled water need to be a after temperature and how much vinegar do i add to the samples
325,1,3,to replicate this experiment the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use the procedure is very vague a scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment therefore the students should specify the marble limestone wood plastic they should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used
326,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group the experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed and if it was rinsed with cold hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature they were kept at also what was the group investigating in should be included
327,1,3,how much vinegar you pour into the cups what kind of vinegar you use what kind of containers you should use
328,1,2,to make this procedure repeatable we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with otherwise we couldn't even start the experiment we would also need to know how much vinegar in ml to pour in the cups
329,1,2,to replicate the experiment i would need additonal information for example how much vinegar should be poured into each container i would also want to know the size of each sample and make sure the surface area of each is as close to equal as possible lastly i would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with with this information i am certainly capable of repeating the experiment
330,1,2,after reading the groups procedure i was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring all they tell us is vinegar also what is the size of the containers how much of each sample is being poured into the container the group would need to tell us these facts so we can follow their steps to do the same experiment
331,1,0,i think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after see if there were any physical changes if something was to change then the group should've got it down so we know the features of the items
332,1,2,after reading the groups procedure to replicate this experiment i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are acurate they would also need to include the four samples names marble limestone wood and plastic so i know what everything what everything is so i can create a data table they would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances i would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in
333,1,0,more information is needed more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion not many materials are listed
334,1,0,3 pieces of information i would include to replicate ths procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container let samples sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours i choose that to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment
335,1,1,i would still want to know what they were doing this experiment how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples
336,1,1,in order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research
337,1,3,you would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker ph level you would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant
338,1,0,the additional information you need to replace the experiment you need limestone wood and plastic marbles you test all of them in different containers it will give you the mass of the experiment that is what it need to replace the experiment
339,1,0,how much of the material did they put into each container was there a controlled part of this experiment did they conduct a graph for this experiment
340,1,1,i would say one piece of information they forgot was the amount of vinegar they put in each procedure
341,1,3,in the procedure it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample finally additional information that should be added would be telling where to keep these samples where it's cold room or hot temperature
342,1,3,how much vinegar would you pour in each cup what temperature would the samples be in would it be the same or would it be different how would also need to know if they used the same size cup these things are all very important information that wasn't included
343,1,3,the additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers do they want us to use you would need a sample of each of the substances as well as knowing what type of each substance you need last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers which changes the mass of each sample
344,1,3,some additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar size of the containers and the temperature
345,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known also the type of container is not specified nor is the number of pieces of the samples that should be tested stated all of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment
346,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment more information is needed for example there has to be clear statement of problem this procedure doesn't explain why they were finding out the mass of four different samples also there has to be information on how much vinegar they put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment
347,1,1,the additional information it would need would be the
348,1,0,to replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with you will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do
349,1,2,some information that could be added could be temperature of the vinegar or water you could also add how much vinegar you add another thing to add would be a list of possible samples
350,1,1,something that the group would need to do in order to make the procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials this insures that who ever has to do the experiment gets everything before they start second make the sets easier to understand step 3 is very hard to interpret lastly make sure you clean up them at the end
351,1,2,first i would need to know what they used to determine the mass it would also be helpful if they put the 4 different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure in case there was no data table present they could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them so i would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter i would also need to no how much of each material to use
352,1,0,i believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
353,1,0,to replicate their experiment i would need to have take their their procedure and use them i would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment all these need are the true basic's
354,1,1,to replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar needs to be more clear it says pour vinegar into a container but it's not specific as to how much vinegar also how much of the sample that will be used isn't stated
355,1,2,in order to replicate this expiriment you would need to know how much vinegar you should distribute into the container how long you should run thewater on it for rinsing how much of the each material you need
356,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the material samples were marble limestone acid and plastic you would also need to know the amount of vinegar that was placed in the cup and you would need to know what you are weighing the mass in which is grams if these three were added to the procedure then you could replicate the experiment
357,1,1,to replicate the expirement i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample
358,1,0,to me i think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working
359,1,3,i would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as ml where do i put the cups in the sun or refridarter where do i let the samples dry in the open or the outside
360,1,1,after reading the group's procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples then pour vinegar in a container and after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water in order to replicate this experiment i would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples
361,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container how much distilled water each sample was washed with and the size of the containers
362,1,3,after reading the group procedure the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure how much vinegar should i pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface we would have more contact with the vinegar ending it right and the mass of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need know how much of each sample was used
363,1,2,to replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container it would also put what effect of materials its going to use
364,1,3,in order to replicate this procedures you would need to know
365,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the samples were also step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific they might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate
366,1,2,addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers another thing that would be needed is the types of racks because the grap didn't specify the different samples in the procedure the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after for example they could have said to measure it in grams
367,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment after reading you will need to know what the 4 different samples are you will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container you will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours
368,1,0,additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down
369,1,2,i would need how much vinegar im putting in the containers what kind of lime and plastic like where it came from and what kind of temperature should the samples dry in
370,1,2,some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples how much vineger do you have to pour into each container and how many trials are needed to get more accurate data we need those information to know how to do this experiment
371,1,0,my opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the 4 samples and the procedure presents the table
372,1,0,you need to repeat the the experiment 2 more time record all data then compare them to see of samples have any change also backround information is important to any experiment
373,1,1,in order to repeat this lab exactly as they did i would need to know what materials i'd need for example the marble wood limestone plastic was not writen in the procedure
374,1,0,in order for you to replicate the experiment you would have to change the time usage to see if there would be a different outcome also in step 2 where it says to pour vinegar in each of the four containers change how they are using vinegar and substitute it for another liquid to see if these would effect anything lastly i would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer
375,1,1,in this procedure the group calls the materials samples instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the chart when they just say samples that can mean anything in step number one they should say why you need to determine the mass of the four materials
376,1,0,after you determine the mass of the products go back and see of your thesey was correct then go and daght a lab report about qv then when your done hand it qn
377,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment for acid rain you need additional information first you need to know what type of samples your using second the procedure did not specify how big each samples should be having different sizes might change the results lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water you should know what temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results
378,1,2,the additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in whether this was the same for each sample these additional steps details would help create accuracy consistency for all who completed the experiment
379,1,1,i think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be anther is they didn't put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses
380,1,1,some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar in order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it you also have to do some math to get the difference in mass
381,1,2,to repeat in experiment doing the group procedure i would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each container another information
382,1,1,to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup i would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained
383,1,2,i would need to know how much samples i need for this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i am pouring into each container also i would need to know if i am letting the samples dry in the sun or not without these i could not replicate this experiment
384,1,2,i would need to know how much vinegar was used how big the containers are and if each sample should be the same mass
385,1,0,more you could repete the expierement just see it
386,1,1,first the experiment needs to have a controll they need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials second they need more than one trial for each material i suggest three so you recieve better data the third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample
387,1,0,the limestone have mass than all of them
388,1,0,you would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar distilled water and some other materials
389,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers you would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same finally you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours
390,1,3,to replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for we would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup we would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying and we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar
391,1,2,we would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup also we would need to know how much or each sample to use and which materials we would also need a control so would need to place something in regular water as well
392,1,1,this experement didn't have a controle and the grupe didn't do multiple triles you would also may need to know what tempriture the rome is
393,1,3,you will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them
394,1,1,some additional information thats needed in this experiment acid rain would be explang more in detail about how to use the steps ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc ways this experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish this experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel
395,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated lastly the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included
396,1,0,to replicate this experiment you will need the following vingar to your in each identical container you will need to let the sample sit and dry for30 minutes after 24 hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water
397,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers
398,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of the sample to put in each container where they stored the containers for 24 hours and where they put each sample when they removed them from the containers and rinsed them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for 30 minutes
399,1,2,some additional information would include the amount of vinegar poured into each container mass of the sample taken and the temperature where the 4 containers were stored for the 24 hours
400,1,2,the procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it also you do not know what the four samples are in the second step how much vinegar should be poured in the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable a last step should also be included to say repeat
401,1,1,after reading the procedure i would need to know the materials the students are using i would also need to know why they are doing the experiment what is the purpose what kind of containers are they using and how big are they
402,1,2,additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment include the amount of vinegar poured into each container where the containers are stored or kept for 24 hours how the samples should be dried and lastly with what should the masses be taken on
403,1,0,for one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure they also should state to use the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate finally the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment
404,1,0,you would need to state that wood didn't lose any mass the plastic lost 1 of mass the marble lost 4 of mass and the limestone lost 1 3 mass then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass
405,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included one thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container if there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily another thing they would have included is a control without a control there is nothing to compare your results to one last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you must know how much of each sample that you used if you use more of one sample than another then of course it is going to way more each sample should be the same size
406,1,2,the students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in are they all solids in the same shape or are they ground upp the ammount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples also they should state how much vinegar should be put into the containers and that the ammount of vinegar in each container should be the same what type of vinegar it is should also be included
407,1,0,a hypothesis was needed in this experiment also the group should had told the reader what was happening why the experiment was taking place also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate
408,1,0,additional things a i would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry
409,1,2,you would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted what results where they looking for you should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
410,1,0,you would need 1 more trials 2 different types of samples and 3 maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins
411,1,0,the additional info i would need to replicate it is marble limestone wood plastic water container vinegar label
412,1,2,the group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure they need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container the group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass
413,1,0,limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it
414,1,0,they need to repeat every step that already preformed
415,1,3,in order to replicate this group's procedure i would need the following information p 1 when they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples they should name and list the samples that they plan on using p 2 in step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in p 3 when they say in step four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water how much water should we use and how long should we rinse
416,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample you would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer
417,1,3,in order to replicate the group students experiment the additional information i would need to encure how big the four identical containers were how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment how much vinegar and the students pour into each container
418,1,1,the iddtional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs and the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar we pour in each four separete but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation what did we learn
419,1,1,in order to replicate the group's experiment there is additional information that would need to be known such as how much vinegar was poured into the four seperate containers how much of each sample is used and what the group used in order to determine the mass of each sample
420,1,2,in order to do this experiment again you would need to know the exact mass of the 4 samples what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rinse the samples for
421,1,3,some additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each seperate containers if i did not have the data table i would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are it would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used in order to replicate on experiement the procedure must be precise and not have any information out or else the data may come out completely different and not be comperable to the first set of data
422,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the quanity of the variables sample materials it is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w distilled water use were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water mostly evapoltantiy i need to know how they determined the mass of the samples what was their tool of measurement
423,1,3,in order to repeat the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined due to the sorroundings it was in
424,1,3,you would need a control to look back on you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right with the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials
425,1,0,what was the purpose for them doing this experiment p why did they choose to set up there lable this way p and for me to replicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that there's no problem also there not alot of information provide that examples the directions
426,1,0,it doesn't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation so we would be able to do the work but i would know what we did if for after
427,1,1,if there is a control they would need to identify it they should also tell the type of material tell the mass' unit of measurement
428,1,3,additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into also although indicated in the data table the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in should it be poured limestone a block of wood etc and also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end all of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment
429,1,0,you should in all procedures out in an actually experiments
430,1,1,one step that missed was to gather all all the materials another step that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup another step they might have to add as well is how much distilled water that would be to one each errape
431,1,0,in addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples
432,1,0,after reading the groups procedure i think they should have added record the data get materials observe the expariment and repeat expariment
433,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information i could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa
434,1,1,i would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes also i would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that i have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples
435,1,0,they should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor
436,1,0,the additional information that i would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar also to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples
437,1,1,after reading the group's procedure some good additional information would be what the containers are made of the dependent variable and the dependent variable
438,1,2,first off i'd need to know maybe the material of each sample
439,1,2,in this experiment an additional iformation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container this may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples i also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass
440,1,2,this group is lacking a control group in their procedure also they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers next the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1
441,1,2,first i would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container also i would need to know what the environment is the sample stored would be stored in over the 24 hour period p lastly i would need to measure the mass of the four different samples and the volume of the liquids
442,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would first need to know how much volume or mml you would need to pour into the containers also you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rinse the containers nothing b messed up in the experiment and step 5 does not explicate how to d it does the experiment want the containers to have the same area it does not explicate
443,1,2,there are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it first step 1 says determine the nose of four different samples they should have said what the samples were of second step 2 says pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar third there is no control in this experiment they should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control
444,1,2,additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to pour into each container it should say what each sample is in the procedures a list of materials
445,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how big samples to use you would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment
446,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment the group's procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in g to specify which samples were being used marble limestone wood of plastic and specify the size and type of the containers used beakers
447,1,1,additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers should i buy the materials or use natural resources
448,1,1,if i has to replicate the expinment i would need to know what types of samples are being used and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign also how do you determine the mass
449,1,3,this information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment p amount of vinegar poured p identify types of samples used in the procedure p temperature and p size of containers open closed lid
450,1,1,after reading this procedure i would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand in order to replicate this experiment you would need to label what material is going into the container what you're labeling it and what single sample enters the container in the end also to make this experiment more reliable you would need to add more trials to your procedure also if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table you would need to identify the four samples in step one
451,1,0,one thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger also they should have a hypothisis
452,1,1,you would need to add materials that you need to use you also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups you should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like a b c d
453,1,0,in order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the containers you would need to use some sect of measuring material like a scale to know the affects of vinegar on the material you also need all starting mass of materials to be the same mass
454,1,3,to replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is tuching it
455,1,1,in the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example the could say determine the mass of 4 different rock samples i also think they say sample too many times you get confused about what they are saying one last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container
456,1,0,where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment why do you need vinegar where does the acid come from
457,1,0,after reading this group's procedure i think they should have used more than four samples so they coold find out different sources from other types of stone also i think they should have one more trials
458,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so i don't put in too much or too little i would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly if i had only looked at the group's procedure i would need to know what four samples the students used so that i could replicate the experiment and then i would need to know where the containers were kept so i could give mine the same amount of light and other things
459,1,2,after reading the groups procedure i determined that in order to replicate the exeperiment additional information is needed first the procudere doesn't state what is being tested we need to know what specific samples are being refered to next we haven't been told how much of each sample is required in the individual containers lastly we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container
460,1,0,the additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples which is the marble limestone wood and plastic the information that is needed is the starting and ending mass
461,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples if not then a person might use any different mass samples also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers to make this procedure replicateable the group would have to make these change
462,1,3,three pieces of additional information that i would need are as follows first how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers secondly how large should the samples be the last thing i would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be
463,1,1,to replicate this experiment i would also need to know in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment
464,1,3,after reading the group's procedure in and for me to replicate this experiment i would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for me knowing these three additional sources of information i could successfully replicate this experiment
465,1,0,to replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them
466,1,3,you would need to know what the four different samples are also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers lastly you need to know what temperature to store them at
467,1,3,the group's procedure was pretty vague there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar and how large the samples are also each sample should be named in the procedure like determine the mass of marble limestone wood and plastic samples should be stated in the procedure
468,1,1,to repeat the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers you would used to know the purpose of the experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples
469,1,3,just based off of the procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount you'd also need to know what in use as a container as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result you'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample and what the samples are
470,1,0,well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water three pieces of information limestone plastic marble
471,1,1,after reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first they need to tell you correct measurements such as how much vinegar to pour also they should tell you how to determine the mass of each sample because there are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc both of these observations should be added to the produre in order to do the experiment
472,1,2,some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment first of all the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment marble limestone wood and plastic they also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar and type of vinegar that needs to be put in each cup the procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials
473,1,3,you would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material for example plastic could
474,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers a third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak all of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment
475,1,1,information i would need p what do they want to find out in other words their implied aim p the amnt of vinegar p the amnt of sample
476,1,2,to be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things for example do they want us to use the same materials of course they do so that's one another is what kind of containers do they want us using we can use plastic or metal or another lastly you would need to know how much distilled water that you need
477,1,1,in order to deplicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the people used if we don t know and we use more or less it could change the experiments outcome also we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones and finally it would help if they measured the mass inbetween the 24 hours
478,1,1,one additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar in ml is needed to pour into the containers every container needs the same amount of vinegar the other additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass has to be determined or else you would miss the point the third additional information needed is what to measure the samples with and what unit they need to be measured in they all need the same unit and balance
479,1,2,to repeat this expirement i would need to know what the four samples were and how wide the containers should be
480,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated
481,1,1,what they missed was the samples that they were pouring the vinegar on they need to have every piece of information in the procedure so other people can do this job
482,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass because if we put a different amount we're going to get a different result
483,1,2,one thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container also which tsamples are they using and also how much of the sample should u use for example the whole object half the object also if they were making a table what information do u need to record
484,1,0,pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers p after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water p placing a single sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a singl
485,1,0,you would need starting mass ending mass and difference in mass in order to replicate the experiment
486,1,0,to replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time also do a graph showing the difference in weight we need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one
487,1,0,nsr
488,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to pouring i sample into more than just one container instead of rinsing each sample with distilled water wait 48 hours instead of allowing the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes let it dry for hour
489,1,1,how to extract the materials from the vinegar what conditions would the materials be drying ex sunny warm place or dark cold place what conditions would the material be soaking in temp light ext
490,1,1,you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups that way you would get more accurate results
491,1,2,you would need to know how much vinegar to use what size the containers should be and how many trials to conduct to replicate the experiment
492,1,1,to replicate this experiment the following information is needed the amount of vinger that is needed in this experiment should be given in this experiment to much or to little virner may be used there should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinger in and the labeling may not be the right label the experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with
493,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment they would need to determin what the materials were they would have to establish a control and they would have to give directions to find the difference in mass
494,1,1,after reading the groups procedure some information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water also i would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup lastly you would need to do multiple trials for reliability
495,1,2,some additional information i would need would include what objects to determine the mass of also to replicate this procedure i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount i would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with finally their procedure doesn't tell exactly how to determine the mass
496,1,2,the procedure should include what the four different samples are at this point it is to vague and needs to be specified the procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers the procedure should also encourage repetition human and equipment errors as always possible therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary finally the procedure does not include a control this doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results
497,1,0,the information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble limestone wood and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each what material did you use to get this answer what effects did it have on all material such as color and size
498,1,1,1 i would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample p 2 what are they trying to find out through pass is to amount p 3 was there a control group in this experiment
499,1,3,you would need to know how big of cups to use how much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get
500,1,3,some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh so they are all equall what type of container should the sample be put into how should i determine the mass of the different samples how much vinegar to pour into the samples
501,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar you use for amount of marble limestone and wood water you could use and has to determine the mass of the material
502,1,1,to exactls replicat this expirement you leashneed to know how much of each sample to test with also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with
503,1,2,you need something like a scale to determine the mass determine the mass of four different samples you need to identify what that sample you also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed
504,1,2,determine the mass of four samples of what how much vinegar is needed in the containers you would need a scale to measure the different containers are the different containers made of the same material
505,1,3,you would need to know the amount of vinigar they added what kind of containers and how much or how big each object is
506,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment the student would need to include how much distilled water the sample should be rinsed with as well as how they determined the mass of the samples lastly they need to show us how much vinegar they poured into the containers
507,1,2,there are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment some pieces of information they could add are the type of sample to use and the mass each sample should be these would help because will not them you don't know which samples you are supposed to use and if they're not all the same across you could get invalid results also they need to tell you how much vinegar to put in each cup or else once again there is a risk of the data being invalid
508,1,2,some additional information you would need is how much vinegar to put in the four containers the actually samples they use marble limestone wood plastic and how you would measure the mass of each sample
509,1,2,the additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be what is in each of the containers how much vinegar is put in each of the containers and how much of the sample is in each container in the procedure they don't say what was in each of the containers they also didn't say how much vinegar that they put into the containers lastly they didn't say how much of the sample was in the containers they needed to add that information in order to replicate the experiment
510,1,1,you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment
511,1,2,i would need to know several things before replicating this job first i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container also i would need to know what i should do to determine the mass of the samples lastly i would need to know how much distilled water to use and what identical containers i should use
512,1,0,i would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isn't it poisoning to humans
513,1,2,to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately also the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment also in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference can be found and the change seen
514,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in secondly i need to know on what i should place the samples on to allow them to dry lastly to replicate the experiment i need to know the control group and the type of container i should use also it would be necessary to know what i should weigh the samples on
515,1,3,in order to repeat this experiment you would need to know what containers the samples were put in how much vinegar to pour into the containers and where you should let the samples dry off
516,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated you would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical a third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them in the procedure the samples' identities are not given
517,1,1,additional information they could have added is mass the weight of vinegar poured into the samples they also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with diffent samples and repeat the process used also they could have waited for more than 30 mins to let the distilled water dry oil out
518,1,1,additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do i pour into each container also i would need to know the control of the experiment so i could see what changed and how i also need to know what i should use to measure the mass they only say nreeus the mass in their experiment they never told me specifically what to measure it with
519,1,3,more information would be needed to replicate the experiment it needs to be explained what the samples are of it should say how much vinegar to use also it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar there should be a control included within the experiment directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass
520,1,1,use the same material that is used for the experiment
521,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific it would need to tell how much vinigar is used in the containers have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after 30 minutes and say what the samples are weighed with it is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles
522,1,1,i would need to know what the samples were
523,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know how much of the samples to use how much vinegar to use and how big the containers have to be
524,1,0,why they even did it is in the first place and what am i wanting to replicate the experiment and also where would i get the supplies i needed and if there's anything that i shouldn't use in this experiment
525,1,0,the additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is a watch a measureing container also some marbles limestone wood and plastic
526,1,2,to repeat this experiment again you would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured into the containers the volume could each have to be equal to get the best results next you would want to know the volume of the containers so that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment you have the same results last you would want to know the amount of distilled water you used and the volume of the samples so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar
527,1,3,in order to replicate this group's experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each
528,1,2,one extra piece of information that i would need to replicate the experiment is the wot that was used to measure mass i would also need to know what the four different samples were in addition i would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used
529,1,3,the additional information that should be included in this procedure is how much vinegar goes in each sample where do the samples go to sit and dry at label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data
530,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the group's hypothesis and whether it was retreat or incorrect this will help one to eliminate their thinking if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and whether all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar lastly i would need to see results from a controlled experiment such as a rock with water and make sure it does not decay
531,1,2,there are several pieces of information that i would need to replicate this experiment firstly in step one i would want to know specifically what the four different samples were secondly in step two i need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers thirdly in step three i would need to know how much of each material to put into each container having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent all three of these pieces of additional information would extremely helpful in replicating this experiment and avoiding possible source of error while replicating
532,1,2,the three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows
533,1,0,i would have to check the mass of four different samples put vinegar in each one of the separate containers put a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone wood and plastic while waiting 24 hours i would remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour
534,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers you would also need to know what the materials are that you're putting into containers you also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are all these things are essential to replicating this experiment
535,1,2,information i would need to replicate i mass 4 samples should i
536,1,1,same additional into that would be needed is how much vinegar should be poured into each container i would also like to know how much distilled water was used and finally there should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesn't talk about acid rain once
537,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know p 1 how much vinegar to put in each container p 2 how much water to use when you rinse each sample use distilled water temperature of water as well p 3 what temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying p 4 how big the containers are p 5 what environment is the experiment taking place in hot warm freezing wet etc
538,1,0,after reading the group's procedure the group should add a hypothesis controll and objective
539,1,2,after reading the procedure to their experiment i would also need to know how much vinegar to use what are we using to determine the mass of each samples from the containers with and what are the fair samples suppose to be
540,1,2,the procedure should contain what different samples are going to weighed it also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers lastly the procedure should contain the information if the masses are going to be record do make a data table
541,1,2,the procedure is very flowed because i can't even understand half of it when they are talking about the four samples they need to clarify what the samples are they also need to clearly give the distinction of the container the samples and where viniger is poured into lastly they need to not write step 3 because the container sample and label have no refereced and are just plain renthstig
542,1,3,any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water
543,1,1,a couple more things i would write in this experiment would be to make a hypothesis also when you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the rocks are in the same place so they all dry evenly lastly i would also i would compare the weights of all the rocks and see which ones heaviest at the begining and the end
544,1,2,they didn't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers this could effect the mass of the object at the end they should specify how much to use and how big the containers are plus mention what the material the containers are
545,1,0,pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical containers after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes
546,1,1,to replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock's masses how much vinegar you're putting the rocks in finally you need to know how much of each sample you're putting in a container
547,1,2,first you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup second you will need to know the temperature of the room third you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal
548,1,2,additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would include what the sample materials i was using were what kind of result am i looking for when receive my data and what is the problem that i am suppose to attempt to solve it would also be helpful to know where these materials were placed whether it be in the sun or in the dark by knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible
549,1,0,one thing they could have that they don't is a control of this procedure the next thing they could have changed that they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each of the building material the final thing is that i think with starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals
550,1,1,i would like to know what the experiment is for what are the measurements for all this how much vinegar in each container
551,1,2,to make this experiment's procedure complete three additional things are needed first the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification second the vinegar being poured into the containers should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all containers finally all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier these additional steps would make the procedure better
552,1,3,additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials also other info would be what size containers do you need for this experiment lastly does it matter the material of the container glass metal throw away containers
553,1,0,to replicate the experiment i would need to know what the students goal was i always label how much of an amount to put into a container in their procedure its that the students did not do this
554,1,0,i would needed to know what different samples to find the mass how much starting mass i would need and how to measure the ending mass without these three pieces of information i would not be able to replicate the experiment exactly
555,1,3,i would need to know if they were put into an incubator to dry or were dryed in a different way would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry also i would need to know where i should place a sample lastly i would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white apple material also i would need to know how top measure the mass
556,1,2,to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in each container you will also need to know how you are determining the mass of the sample and what the samples actually are of what material
557,1,0,the students need a list of material also the students should write that we have to form a hypothesis the students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment
558,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh you would also need to know what four samples to use also to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container
559,1,3,in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need some additional information i would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container
560,1,1,the additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure you would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass you would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass
561,1,1,in step one they could tell you the 4 different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container after step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed
562,1,1,there is something missing in the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers what it fails to mention is how much vingar to pour into each container without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinager added but there is no mention of how much to add
563,1,2,i would need to know what to measure the weight in how much vinegear to put in and how long to rinse each sample with distilled water for
564,1,1,while i would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors how to get the starters mass of each sample between the starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it
565,1,3,if you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel and tell the size of each of the samples
566,1,2,we would need to know 1 the four types of sample mentioned in 2 would need to be classified temperature of vinegar 3 type of wood plastic etc they used and 4 the amount of vinegar they poured into each container
567,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use one would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container also the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this
568,1,2,step one really should go at the end you need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it i would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph
569,1,1,in order to adequately replicate this experiment one would need more specific samples for example instead of wood it should be a specific type of wood marble limestone or plastic the procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after 24 hours
570,1,1,you would need the independent varible that never changes to replicate the experiment would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four containers also how did the mass reacted to the substance
571,1,1,one thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar and lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for days weeks it never tells you this information it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things
572,1,0,first off you would need more samples of the rocks to put in the rain also to replicate the experiment you would need to new to state the next day try the experiment all over again the person replicating it would also have to wait a whole other 24 hours more water and vinegar would be needed too
573,1,2,to replicate the experiment the students need to include more detail in their procedure first we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment the students tell us to pour vinegar into containers however it is not clear how much vinegar to use if the amounts of vinegar are different the entire experiment will not be accurate to improve the experiment the students could have done more trials to get better observations
574,1,0,i would need to know how
575,1,1,one thing they should include is how much vinegars they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the containers
576,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment i need to know how much vinegar did the group of students pour in the identical containers i need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other
577,1,3,additional information i would need to replicate the experiment is to whether i should leave the samples in a dark or lighted area for the 24 hour time period also i would need to know if i should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area i would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use it doesn't state it clearly
578,1,3,you would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain you would also need to know what type of materials you need another piece of needed information is how much vinegar to pour into each container because the more vinegar added the stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be able to eat away at the samples more you would also need to know where the containers were placed for the 24 hours whether they were placed at cool temperature hot or cold
579,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container you need to know the 4 different samples what to do with the difference in masses what do the difference in the mass's tell you
580,1,0,this procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grams they gave foour different samples but they didn't include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples the purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples
581,1,1,first off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the containers also that they should have addedacontrol or just water to have samples to confound and do
582,1,1,the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material and the third thing is they need a controlled
583,1,1,to replicate the experiment you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cups
584,1,1,you would need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples also plase the same amount of vinegar and water into each container allowing students to record the correct data
585,1,2,the additional information i need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container what kind of container am i supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object
586,1,0,if i replicated this i would also need what i uses acid rain in measuring the container masses and how the acid rain would effect
587,1,3,in order to replicate this group's experiment i would need to know how much vinegar they put in each container also i would need to know what type of marble limestone wood and plastic was used finally i would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment
588,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use what it should be able to hold how much vinegar to pour into each container how many ml what type of vinegar what to weigh the samples on bathroom scale or type of beam balance maybe electronic
589,1,2,the procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first it should include measurements we need to know how muche vinegar to put with each sample second the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals
590,1,1,to replicate this experiment you need the materials used in the experiment also you would need to make sure you follow the directions record your data
591,1,2,in order to replicate this procedure they should includ a set mass for each stone i e 10g of each sample they also shuld include the amount of vinegar to be poured in each cup and the third they should include the size of the container
592,1,2,i would need to know how much of each material was used because it doesn't say in the procedure i would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container i would also have to know how much water or how long to rinse the samples with the distilled water
593,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would need other than the procedure what samples to use what materials how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in these pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain finally the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours
594,1,2,the group needs to include each specific in their conclusion the amount of vinigar must also be specified as well as the amount of each sample being placed in each container the group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample the table provided suggests that the group measured the mass of each sample and the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass but it was never mentioned in their procedure
595,1,1,you may want to tell in the experiment how much vinegar you are pouring in explain how you found the differences in mass mass before you rinse with the distilled water
596,1,2,in the procedure the group should have included what samples they were going to use marble limestone wood plastic the group should have also gave to exact amount of how much vinegar to use in each cup it would also have been useful if the group would have in the first procedure to measure the mass of each sample separately
597,1,2,the students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items they would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container it is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water
598,1,0,you wouldn't need any information they provide you with all the information you need they tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart
599,1,2,additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples in this doesn't tell you if each sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially covered the starting mass of limestone was 9 8g the ending mass was 9 4g that was a 0 4g difference the experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegar this is very important to know in order to replicate this experiment
600,1,1,what are the four samples are what kind of materials you would need are tgoing out a hypothesis
601,1,2,to replicate the experiment i would need to know what four different samples to use to determine the mass how much vinegar do i pour in each of the four samples and am i doing all four at the same time so they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time
602,1,2,in order for me to replicate this groups experiment i need to know what type of sample am i weighing i need to know how much vinegar am i pouring in the containers i also need to know what i am labeling on containers and what das i use to remove samples from the containers
603,1,3,some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these 3 things would make very experiment as close as possible to the group's
604,1,2,you would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment one would be how much vinegar to pour into the container another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ a third piece of information needed would be what samples to use also if they should all start out with the same mass or not
605,1,2,the additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container i also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours inside outside by a window
606,1,2,one piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing
607,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal i would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the 24 hours ex shade sun lastly i would need to know what kind of container should be used a plastic a covered or a dark container etc
608,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment one would need to know what the sample was a desirable range in which the mass could fall under and the amount of solution vinegar that should be applied for each sample having a large range and an equal amount of solution compromises the validity
609,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the 4 different materials are that i'd be testing in addition i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar that needs to be poured on each sample finally i would need to know that i was finding the difference in the mass from start to finish for each of the samples otherwise i would be missing my dependent variable
610,1,0,to replicate the experiment you are need to divide the different substances add more vinegar to each containers add more distilled water having them sit for 24 hours for about 30 minutes mass them and see how they wash
611,1,2,you need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the containers will change alittle
612,1,2,1 have a determined size for the starting samples of rock p 2 determine an amount of vinegar p 3 determine what type of containers are being used
613,1,0,you will need to know which rock had the most mass which one had the least and which one was the same
614,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to include how much vinegar is going to be poured in the containers how much water you rinse the containers with where it is being dried and how to measure the mass grams dounds etc
615,1,2,i would include the materials used or the samples also they should include in the procedure the type of measuring they are doing masing and state how much vinegar to pour in each cup
616,1,3,additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in how big the container should be and if the material should be or shouldn't be fully submerged by the vinegar
617,1,2,one piece of information is that you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into eaach container and you need to know what kind of vinegar you need for the experiment you also need to know what you're supposed to do with the data after you have collected it to find the answer to your problem it doesn't say in the procedure to analize the data or anything like that
618,1,1,to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample i would also need to know what the control of the experiment was so i could compare results of the samples lastly i would need to know if the experiment was completed
619,1,1,include the name of the samples in the procedure p say how do students measure the mass p ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion
620,1,1,the procedure never states what the samples are it needs to add the four samples marbles limestone wood and plastic into the first step the procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i being measured and in the 6th step that the ending mass is being measured the procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimenter to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
621,1,0,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the students are looking for why each steps of the procedure is being done why those four samples were chosen and if there should be more trials or repettions in order to create more accurate data
622,1,0,the additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be
623,1,2,after reading the groups procedure there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment first they didn't state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor second in order to make sure their experiment was valid they could have done another trial and lastly they should state the temperature this is all happening at because that could have an effect on the results
624,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to pour on the four different samples the second thing you need to know is what temperature the room is when you start the experiment the last step is write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record
625,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment the group would need some additional information in their procedure an example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance they need specifics like how much vinegar they need in each container or how big the sample is or what the sample is it's very vague so they should add more specific
626,1,0,i would need to know what the purpose of me doing the experiment would be and what exactly was i trying to find in order to replicate the experiment
627,1,3,to replicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all 4 cups this would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome also include the size of the containers to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples say what sample to use in the experiment too
628,1,2,to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was to be added to to the four separate containers even though the samples are listed in the chart the group drew the name of the samples should be in the procedure
629,1,2,the group failed to identify how much vinegar you should pour into each container what to label the containers or what materials to put in the containers they also forgot to include safety procedures and did not tell you to measure the different in or masses to carry the smals
630,1,2,after reading the groups procedure i think that in order to replicate these experiment i will need to know what type of container and about how much vinigar to put into the conlainer
631,1,2,the additional information that this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour in each containar and say exactly what four samples you are using you need to have these thingsin an experiment because if you don't then you wouldn t know what you are experimenting and what is making that change you also need a control group
632,1,3,to tell me what the samples are in the procedure p how much vinegar to pour in the four containers p where and at what temperature are they putting them in
633,1,2,the biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalide another problem is that they didn't mention how much vinegar should be used the group wasn't very specific for example they didn't say what temp the samples should be kept at by not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid
634,1,0,after you remove the containers you rinse them see what results you get in about so minutes
635,1,1,you would need to know the conditions of the sample p you would need to know what type of plastic because their are so many different plastics p you would need to know what type of wood because their are so many different types p you would also want to know the acidic level of their particular vinegar
636,1,1,to be able to replicate the expariment you would need to know the 4 samples you are exparimenting with although the 4 samples are listed in the data shown below the procedure it doesn't show the samples in the procedure and if i was to do the expariment without the other groups data there is no way i could without knowing the samples
637,1,0,i would need vinegar 4 containers labels time 24hours a sink 30 minutes for them to dry and a tripple beam ballance scale
638,1,3,a person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under all of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know
639,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment the information that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sample also i would need to know what type of vinegar to use and do i put the samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature
640,1,2,after reading the groups i would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment i would also need to know what kind of scale to use to determine the mass of the objects also what kind of container to use
641,1,0,i would need to know what was happening to the samples during that 24 hrs 2 i would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did 3 i would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself
642,1,1,one idea they might need to use is to say what four materials sabstones are being used in your procedure also they should be sure to use a control in this experiment missing the group should also used more than one trial to their experiment lab
643,1,3,you would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container so the results are accurate you would need to know how big each sample was you would also need to know what temperature this experiment was done at
644,1,1,in my experiment i would include steps p 1 gathering materials p 2 observation of the substances p 3 making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water
645,1,2,to repercat this experiment i would need to knew how vingnr what is the controy and what are the samples
646,1,2,the group will need
647,1,3,if i were to replicate this experiment i would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure p 1 how big should the rock samples be p should they be relatively the same size p 2 how much vinegar should be poured into the containers p 3 how long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water p 4 should the containers be made out of any specific material
648,1,3,if i were to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour what temperature to keep the experiment anothe vinegar and what temperature to keep the experiment drying
649,1,3,i would need to know how much vinegar that was used in each of the four containers i would need to know what the four containers contained since they are the samples being used in the experiment and what to use to determine the mass of them
650,1,0,to replicate the experiments you will need all the samples and how you will need more acid rain
651,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what types of samples you should you should be using how much vinegar you should put in each container and you would also need to know how to separate the samples from the vinegar or whether or not the vinegar would be included when finally weighing the end mass of the samples
652,1,2,the person doing the experiment would need to know how much vingear was poured into the container what type of container they used plastic metal glass etc whether or not the person would need gloves tongs and other utensils you will also need a three beam scale to measure your materials before and after
653,1,1,in order to replicate this expirement you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup different amounts of vinegar would add another variable to the expirement compromising the results
654,1,2,additional information you would need to in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar you poured the ph level of th vinegar and much of the sample was added into the vinegar
655,1,2,to replicate the experiment i would need the materials to replicate the procedure i would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the containers to replicate the experiment would need to know where to place the containers with the vinegar and materials in it
656,1,3,i would need to know what the samples were of how much vinegar what containers what material how much of that material
657,1,2,i would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container i also would need to know how many trials were their in addition i would need to know what type of vinegar was used
658,1,2,to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples i would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers and what tempeture are the samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period
659,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container also you would need to how to determine mass not to mention you would need to know in what temperature would need to leave the samples to dry
660,1,0,after reading the group's procedure they would need these four samples they need need to put down what there procedure is about
661,1,1,they could have told us the amount of vinigar used what they used to make the distilled water and the could have explained how to rinse the material i we should sook it in the water for a fewseconds or just rinse them
662,1,2,the group of students investigating acid rain are missing several pieces of vitel information som ther data quatative data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only one type of quatetive data is recorded the sample type eg in a get the container and vngr types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible
663,1,1,to replicate the experiment i would need to know the readly of vinegar used with each materials i would also need to know what kind of plastic they used in the expensal because there are many diffrent
664,1,2,these other pieces of information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment as are what do i obtain marble limestone wood and plastic since there as the of materials
665,1,1,in order to replicate the group's experiment you would need to know some additional information to the procedure given one of these pieces of information is how the group determined the mase of the samples was it with a triple balance scale etc another piece of information explained is how long each sample was finally in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used
666,1,1,additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar to put in the different samples what the constant variable is and how to determine the mass of each sample
667,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what kind of containers to use how much vinegar and
668,1,0,one would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them try to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence
669,1,0,my first piece of information would be a bar graph then i would give specific directions on what i did but i would make it clear so other people can easily do it to then i would write a conclusion why this prblly happened
670,1,0,i would write what
671,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment there is quite a few other pieces of info that they need first you need to know how vinegar you have to pour on each sample secondly you need to know how much of each sample you need finally you need to know the mass of the cups so you don't mix up the sample weight that's the information you need to replicate this expiriment
672,1,2,it should say how much vinegar they use in each container it should say in the procedure what the 4 samples are that they are using each sample of the material they were using should have the same starting mass and same amount of vinegar should be used in each
673,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to add as the first step gather all materials in step two they should tell the amount of vinegar that was used step six should be changed to after allowing each sample to dry determine the mass
674,1,2,you would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample different amounts of vinegar would give different results you'd also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used
675,1,1,i would need to know what kind of instrument they used in order to determine the mass i would need to know what sample materials i'm using in the procedure and i would need to know how many trials i would need to do
676,1,0,you will need a solution results and a conclusion
677,1,3,from this experiment i would need to know how big each of the containers are i would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container if i was to replicate this experiment i would also need to know how long to rinse off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers
678,1,2,to replicate this experiment i would have to know how much vinegar to poor i would have to know whatknd of samples to use
679,1,0,the additional information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment is a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container after 24 hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry the additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference
680,1,0,you would need to add the type of solution the stones on goingin
681,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment the group's procedure should include more specific information they should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples they should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labled this will make the procedure easier to follow it would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers
682,1,0,one additional piece of information that they did not add in the procedure was to determine the change in mass from before and after the experiment also between steps 1 and 2 there needs to be a step to put the samples in the 4 seperate but identical containers
683,1,2,how much vinegar is needed in each dish what is the sample material and how do you determine the mass
684,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need the size the four containers are what the students used to measure the mass and how they got the answer of what the mass is and how much vinegar the students poured into each container
685,1,2,after reading the group experiment i belive that they will need multipule trials they also need a control what type of container how much vinager also what you would use to find the mass
686,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to know a control the remocture to keep the containers at and you need to know how much vinegar
687,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure i would need to know how much vinegar was put to each of the containers so that i can make sure some of them gets the same amount also i would need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples by using a balance or scale etc finally i would need to know if the containers were closed or not because that environmental factor could change the results of an my their experiment
688,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would first need to know the exact measurement of vinegar they used second they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar lastly to repllcate this experiment you would need to know the amount of time that you rinse each material so the all came out equal you would need to know all of these steps because otherwise they could be venables alering the result of the experiment
689,1,3,to replicate this i would need much more information as to sizes of samples also there should be more specific size measurements of the containar lastly they never say how much vinegar to use p all of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment
690,1,0,according to the data that the students recorded the starting mass had higher levels the ending had some other high and low levels and the difference on mass had some law numbers out an order to replicate the experience i would never backround hypothesis graft counclution problem materials i think that what i will need in order to replicate the experiment
691,1,1,the three samples of information would need to replicate the experiment are measurements of the amount of vinegar the materials you would need to use and purpose of the experiments
692,1,3,the procedure is unclear in order to effectively replicate this experiment i would need to know what the four samples that are needed were i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container it would help to know how large each container was as well p1 vinegar amount 2 types of sampling 3 containers size
693,1,2,the first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers how much distilled water has to be used to wash them and does the containers need to do the present exciddion
694,1,2,you have to make sure that you are very specific when writing a procedure some additionally needed information would be in step 1 what measurement are you having the mass in g kg in step 2 you need to give a precise amount that you are putting in the containers for example 10ml another thing is in step 3 what are you labeling the cups saying you need to specify lastly in step 6 you need to put a measurement of what mass is to be calculated in
695,1,0,after reading the groups procedure additional information ii would need in order to replicate the experience is 1 choose 4 different samples to work with 2 instead of pouring vinegar onto the samples use another liquid form 3 and finally instead of letting the samples sit and dry for 30 min you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than 30 min
696,1,1,after reading the group's procedure the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is how i can determine the mass the materials i am working with how identical the containers have to be
697,1,2,to be able to replicate this experiment you would need know how much vineger to put in each containers what type of scale to use to determine the mass also the type of container needed
698,1,1,to repeat this experiment you would need a list of materials
699,1,1,in step 2 of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers
700,1,3,some additional information i would need is i would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers i would also need to know what the samples are to replicate the experiment i would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else
701,1,3,to replicate this i need to know what samples i'm working with it doesn't tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups if says after 24 hours remove samples from the containers where do they go for 24 hours
702,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples to the different samples were listed in the procedure it would be betterunderstand it would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment which is to record vinegar's effect on the mass of the samples it would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container
703,1,1,the additional information i would need is how to determine the mass of four different samples it is well specified also i need to know how much vinegar to pour into different containers then after the experiment is complete i would need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples
704,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar put in to each identical container the four different samples mass of them and where they were put is stated but not how much vinegar was put into the containers
705,1,1,to replicate the experiment you would need to find out exactly what samples were tested in this case the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic you would need to find out when the experiment was being conducted and whose you're testing
706,1,3,i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use also they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion
707,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know many details first i would need to know what samples i am using in order to find their mass i also would need to know how large each material is this way i can perform an accurate best because i would know how large the material was also i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups so that each material recieves the same amount last i would need to know how to rinse each material so that they all recieve the same amount of water
708,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment the group's procedure would need to include what each of the 4 different samples were determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state the conditions the sample would be in for example the temp of the room
709,1,1,you would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample
710,1,3,you would need to know the amount of vinegar needed the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water
711,1,0,the additional information you would needs wch one was the best marble limestone wood and plastic
712,1,3,at the start of the procedure we would need to know what four samples we were testing otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment we also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers we finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in plastic glass we need to know this as well
713,1,3,additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given
714,1,0,this experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment they should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass
715,1,2,three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is 1 to know how much vinegar to use 2 what is the control if any and 3 do you cover the samples over the 24 hr period or do you just leave them uncovered
716,1,1,if this experiment was going to be repeated a control would need to be used instead of using vinegar the materials would be placed in water also the procedure does not clearly state how much vinegar is used on each material the amounts should be equal to balance it out changing the amount of time the samples sit inside the containers could also change the results of the experiment
717,1,1,some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in they need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis
718,1,2,to make this experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it i would need to the near of the 4 different samples in seat 1 ake what are its materials containers can't in step 3 and finally i would need to know what to measure the samples with what kind of units
719,1,1,i would write down how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass they didn't keep track of the experiment p they also didn't repeted the experiment again and i think thats one of the most important thing that everybody should do
720,1,1,i think they should also put why are they doing it i mean what is the main idea of it because just to say they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples like the temperature volume how ro the samples in a determined place etc
721,1,1,addition infarmation you would need in order to replicate the experiment would include controls such as how much of amount of vinegar is needed in step 2 you would also need a specific or a set amount of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need to make trials in the experiment to make sure the results are valid
722,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment the scientist needs to know the amount of vinegar to pour in also wt kind of container the label's title and the device used to measure the mass
723,1,0,how much do you pour in the containers
724,1,0,they also should watch how all the samples change and take notes see if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they then see how it changes during the day
725,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container you should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar lastly you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out
726,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more how much of each sample material needed and how much vinegar you should pour into each container by having this information the lab will be more accurate and correct
727,1,1,the additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar which may have represented acid rain with a p h of 3 2 was put into each sample since p there were different masses of the given samples eg marble 9 8g whereas wood 11 2g p the ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled p the mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
728,1,3,after reading this procedure i have noticed that i would need to know the ph of the vinegar also i would need to kno how much vinegar is needed lastly it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off on the samples making the results diffrent
729,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment they should say what temperature to keep the room at they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results and also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in because if one sample is bigger than another that will also change the results
730,1,2,in order to replicate the group's experiment i would need to know the samples being used how much vinegar to use and also what to lable without this information it would be very difficult to replicate the experiment with just using their procedure because it is not specific enough and doesn't include all the information needed
731,1,2,the students should state what the four different samples are state how much vinigar should be used in each samples container also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye
732,1,2,three additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment are how much vinegar is needed to be poured how long do you rinse the containers for what do you measure the mass in
733,1,2,in order to replicate this lab experiment you would need to know what the names of the four different samples are you would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four containers so there is an even amount in each container another thing you would need to know when replicating this experiment is what you are using to find the mass
734,1,2,i would need to know what kind of samples to use how much vinegar to put on the samples and how to label the containers to replicate the experiment
735,1,0,in order needs say the information
736,1,1,pour the same amount of vinegar on all four after you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it
737,1,1,after reading the group's procedure in order to replicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be that is the only thing they would need to do
738,1,1,the students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed they also didnt say what the four samples were the students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing
739,1,1,as you can see the students investigation went well the materials they used were marble limestone wood and plastic by look of the data you can see that the starting mass for all of them is 9 8 marble 10 4 limestone 11 2 wood 2 2 plastic then the end mass read 9 4 marble 9 1 limestone 11 2 wood and 7 1 plastic as you can see all of them exsape limestone decreased as you can see the investigation took a lot of time to put together so i believe as i have laid out for you that this investigation took a lot of time and they came out with wonderful results
740,1,3,after reading the group's procedure i have determined they could add what 'four different samples' you are using during the experiment the group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers the temperature at which the ''samples'' are to dry ifor 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined
741,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment the group would need to most importantly state what the experiment is for name the materials used and a hypothesis for the experiment
742,1,0,for the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information which is starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass the items are marble limestone wood and plastic then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment
743,1,0,i will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24 24 hours i remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after i determine the mass of each sample
744,1,3,additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers the size of the containers themselves and how long i would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vineger
745,1,2,they should add how much vinegar to pour into the container and how large the container must be as well another thing they might want to add is the concentration of vinegar that is poured in whether 100 or 50 or something alse to find mass you would also need to find volume
746,1,2,to replicate this experiment i will need to say that list what will be the material going inside the container p i will also have to add in water what will have to be four different samples 3 identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials
747,1,3,you need to know how much vinegar to put in each container what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not
748,1,2,the additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container and also the site of the container needed for this experiment
749,1,2,they should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container they should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container they need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes
750,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know a saw things i would need to know how much vinegar they used what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used
751,1,2,how much vinegar do you use for each cup of samples they should have said how much water to rinse each sample with also could you try different liquids
752,1,0,take an hypothesis of what masses they'll have analyze your results and make a conclusion to the problem
753,1,2,the additional information that i would need to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar plced in each cup i would also need to know how much each cup weighs by itself i would need to know how big each individed
754,1,2,the students left out some important information in the procedure like how much vinegar should be put into the cups if we were to replicate the experiment we would not have the students data table so how much of what samples do we need to conduct the experiment where should the samples dry warm cold in the sun
755,1,0,packet in fat it don't make no sense
756,1,2,to replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers you would also need to how big of containers to use and you need to have more than one teal for each of the sediments to use
757,1,1,some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but stilking with
758,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i would need a hypothesis the materials that are needed and the measurement of liquid i would need i would do the experiment the same way so i would also need to know what kind of container to use i would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended
759,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment from the procedure what the four samples are must be included in step 2 the size of the container must be included for step the units being used used to be stated
760,1,1,the additional info that you need is a control how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the material is used
761,1,1,the first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar they didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about
762,1,2,i would need to know how much of each material will be needed also i will need to know how large or small the container will have to be for the end results to be identical lastly i must know where the containers were placed in the sun shade etc or my results may vary
763,1,2,additional information that you would need are the amount of vinegar that you pour into the samples the temperature which you take the experiment and the efficiency of experiment p vinegar affects the mass of sample when it go inside absorb p temperature affects evaporation p efficiency when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions
764,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers that would ensure that the differences in mass of the rocks was because of the rocks and not the amount of vinegar also i may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list
765,1,0,the additional information i would add would be to record the data at the end of the procedure find the average of the samples to find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container
766,1,1,i will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else they could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples
767,1,1,numbe one you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the containers
768,1,1,in the procedure the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers however the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added by not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students' amount also there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found
769,1,2,you would need to know how much wood limestone marble and plastic you would need also how much vinegar to put in the container how long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water those are the information that you would need to do this experiment
770,1,2,the group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container in their procedure they also should have
771,1,2,if you were going to replicate the experiment you would also need to know p what the samples are so you could use them p how much vinegar to put into the containers p what materials you need to gather without the above information you couidn't properly replicate the experiment
772,1,0,the procedure could be better if they included inthere experiment a control if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are using whether it be marble limestone wood or plastic last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose why are they doing this experiment is it nessecary what varaety do they receive from this
773,1,2,to replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting the students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested the final thing would be that the whole procedure needs to be more thorough and more organised with no missing steps or information
774,1,0,the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again do everything you did already but start with the information you already have then determine the mass you end up with and the difference in the mass that's how i would replicate the experiment
775,1,0,to replicate the experiment you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid they should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include lastly that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass
776,1,0,additional information that should've been added to the acid rain experiment is that there needed to be more samples becaus somthing could've went wrong during at least one of the trials bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass
777,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment the group's procedure should mention which samples to use marble limestone wood and plastic it should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container and the size of the samples needed for testing
778,1,1,after you would rinse each sample it would be best to check the temporter how much vinegar where used and i would like to know specifcly how many acid you use in this experiment
779,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know p 1 which kind of samples to use p 2 how much vinegar to add to each sample p 3 how much of each sample to use
780,1,0,limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood marble and plastic so this investigation is complete
781,1,2,there are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to replicate the experiment first of all the procedure fails to mention what the sample materials are so their names would have to be included in the first step additionally the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container in order to replicate the experiment one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers finally the last step states to determine the mass of each sample but does not give a unit of measurement therefore it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams with this additional information one could now replicate the experiment
782,1,2,to replicate the group's experiment more information is neccesary the students should have included the material types instead of four different samples and should have included the measurements used such as amount of each sample container size
783,1,0,on the groups procedure some additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass
784,1,1,they should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idem was affected
785,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know which 4 samples to use then i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container which is very important finally i would need to know what to label each container in order to reciprocate this experiment exactly adding on i would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately
786,1,2,one piece of information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar in the container what the four samples are
787,1,2,some additional information that you would need to add is the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in the container it just says pour vinegar they should also say what the sample is
788,1,3,how much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for also the temperature the writer would be where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold hot areas
789,1,2,some additional informetion that would be needed is for number 2 how much vineagar is needed the size that the containers should be and also another peice of informetion needed is when and what information should be recorded
790,1,2,information needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size containers should be used
791,1,0,1 you will need on hypothesis p 2 you will need a independent variable p 3 you will need a dependant variable
792,1,0,after reading their procedure i don't even know what they are trying to do if it was my procedure i would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on i would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well
793,1,2,in order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are how much vinegar should be pour into the containers and what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample
794,1,1,after reading this group procedure some information that i would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid there would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass
795,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what materials i needed what kind of sample and how much of it
796,1,1,i need the viger the area and the weight to know the mass
797,1,2,although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure in addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g the results are skewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to 7grams of plastic the procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples
798,1,1,some additional information you would need in order to replicate the expirement is to say how many containers and what size how many containers and what size how much of the sample to put in the container
799,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment additional information is needed first the amount of vinegar would be needed also the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different densities finally the temperatures of the room where the solutions sat needs to be known
800,1,0,you would need to give information on what the experiment is about
801,1,0,the first thing thing they did wrong was they didn't explain what their objective and investigation was about also they didn't compare any data and talk about the difference in the mass they got information but it did not have any mention to it
802,1,0,this is a clear investigation of the acid rain they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the differece in mass
803,1,1,the procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the 4 samples in which would he grams as shown in the data table also what to measure them with it should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the containers and finally the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples in step 6
804,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment additional information is needed you need to know how much vinegar to put in each container in step 3 you need to know what material you are putting in each container you also should know how long to rinse the samples and how much water to rinse them in step 4
805,1,3,after reading the group's procedure i can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment first i would need to the materials needed for the lab i would need to get these items in ahead of time and have the right things like containers i would also need to know what kind of rocks were used if i was looking at a sheet or instructions that contained only the procedure i would need to know what rocks were used a third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar for this to be a valid experiment we would need to use the same amount of vinegar
806,1,0,they would need to state the four different samples that they are using they also could have done different trials of the experiment and they should put in the procedure to record the data that they got
807,1,3,after reading the group procedure the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples the group does not say what they are also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container the group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample
808,1,0,additional information that we would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to get 4 cups weigh the 4 cups and then put labels in the four cups with vinegar
809,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment additional iformation is needed the samples p need to be listed also why those samples were chosen needs to be p added in order to replicate the experiment another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass
810,1,3,in order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container i would also need to know what type of container i would even like
811,1,1,to replicate the experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to use in each container you'd need to know what time you started so that you could remove the samples from the containers as soon as exactly 24hrs have passed and lastly you'd need to know what time you set the samples out to dry so they can dry for the full 30min
812,1,1,i would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment
813,1,0,need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and iv and ov
814,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the brand of vinegar
815,1,1,the additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of rock vinegar and distilled water these measurements would be a necessity because they are not given but will determine the outcome of the experiment the amount of rock is what is being tested the amount of vinegar is independent variable the amount of distilled water determine how much vinegar is washed away
816,1,0,the information i want is the measures how much did you put in each cup put the table in order from small or large
817,1,2,in this acid rain procedure it says to add vinegar into each container you to put how much vinegar to put in each and you need to lable the containers you need to also clear she what material are being investigated give a start and stop time put safety googles on
818,1,3,some additional information i would include on the group's procedue would be to specify the types of samples from the first step also to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be the way the masses were measuredshould also be included along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain the place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well lastly they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar
819,1,3,this experiment p in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar put on the container the size of the samples i'd need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples what kind of container do i have to use
820,1,3,a good procedure would show a little more information such as how much vinegar you pour into each container it should also tell the size and or type of containers used in this experiment also for it to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the resaults
821,1,2,firstly it is needed to be known how much vinegar should be pouredinto each of the four seperate containers
822,1,2,in order to replicate the group's procedure i would need some more information i would need to know what the samples were i would need to know the ph vuel of the vinegar and i would need to know if there was any control in the experiment
823,1,0,the sample is marble starting mass 9 8 ending mass 9 4 and difference in mass 0 4 the limestone sample starting mass 10 4 9 1 ending mass difference 0 4
824,1,3,in order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information first they need to specity what the
825,1,2,if i were to replicate this experiment by looking at the procedure i would need a little more information to make it accurate first of all you would need to know what the different samples were marble limestone wood and plastic i would also need to know that i had to measure the mass in grams and i would also need to know how much vinegar i need to pour in each cup
826,1,2,after reading the students experiment i would need to know what size containers how much vinegar for each sample the kind of sample and the mass of the sample
827,1,2,you would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample you should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample
828,1,2,to replicate the experiment you will need to know how much vinegar they put in each single container you will need the size of the single containers and you need to determine the same masses for the materials
829,1,1,the additional information i would need is how many trials they're going to do also how much vinegar they have to por in each container another piece of information they should have added is the safety things you need goggles gloves etc
830,1,1,some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples also since there is multiple varieties of plastic they could state what kind of plastic they used
831,1,0,you would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed
832,1,2,the procedures needs to tell me how much vinegar i'll be pouring into the containers also what kind of container i'll be using when determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as a triple beam balanced or no electronic soaks
833,1,3,in order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container also what size container should be used another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed
834,1,1,to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container
835,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment with only the procedure one would need to know what the given materials are one would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup without this information the results would be inaccurate in addition one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample this information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment
836,1,2,i would need to know the original size of each of the four different samples it is important to have them all be the same size i would also need to how much vinegars to put in the containers the third piece of additional information i would need to know is how much much distilled water i should rinse off each sample with
837,1,2,the aditional informatiou i would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar needs to be added to each identical containers what kind of materials are being placed into the samples and know why the mass is being calculated
838,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the containers you would also need to know how much marble limestone wood and plastic are needed in each container last you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold
839,1,0,before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples
840,1,0,you have to minus the ending mass from the starting mass
841,1,1,after reading the group procedure the additional information the info i need is how much vinegar should i pour into the four different cups how could i prove to make sure its right without more than one trail what are they really trying to investigate also what are they actual trying to determine
842,1,1,the 3 pieces of information you would kneed to know in order to replicate the experiment is you need to know how much vinegar you are going to pour in each container how big in diameter the marble are and what is the mass before you put the marble in the vinegar
843,1,1,in order to replicate experiment i would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in each container how much of each sample to put in the container and
844,1,3,if i was going to repeat this experimen i would need to know 2 things about the vinegar i would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples in and what type of vinegar what type of plastic would i need what temperature would i put the samples soak in
845,1,3,after reading the group's procedure additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was used how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry tinet paper towel in the sun etc
846,1,1,i believe that they should of put more information for example what happen when they were done with the experiment and what would happen if they didn't pour the right amount of vinegar that was needed
847,1,3,some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container the size or amount of each sample needed the type of containers to hold each sample in
848,1,0,in this experiment you need to know the starting mass of all 4 samples and the ending mass of all of them you may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours what would that do to the samples
849,1,1,to replicate this you would a hypothesis also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample you would not be able to retest this experiment this information one other thing you might need is a control for the experiment something to compare the results with
850,1,2,i would need to know the problem and what tools to use and if i have to use marble limestone wood and plastic and how much vineger to use i would also need to know is how big the container is
851,1,0,to replicate the experiment i would need the data the samples of the experiment and i would also need the equipment
852,1,2,to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample also i would need to know how to mass the samples determine the mass is too vague sets no 4 finally i would need to know what type of containers to use plastic cups styrofoam covers p initial amount for each samples
853,1,0,the first starting mass was for wood 11 2g ending mass 11 2g and difference in mass 0 0g second was limestone with starting mass 10 4g ending mass 9 1g difference 1 3g third starting mass was marble 9 8g ending mass at 9 4g and difference in mass 0 4g last was plastic starting mass 7 2g ending mass 7 1g difference 0 1g
854,1,0,the group would need to table the date explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the outcome of their experiment was this will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying to find out and day
855,1,2,some additional information how much vinegar do i pour into the cup wha sample materials are they useing how do i find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be adde
856,1,0,i would need the procedure the samples starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
857,1,2,additional information i would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the students put into each container i would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment
858,1,1,after reading the group's procedure some additional information i would need to replicate the experiment would be p 1 to know the amount of vinegar they used p 2 to know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since they didn't label that p 3 to know whether or not the mass of the materials was with the mass of the container because that will effect the results and decrease validity
859,1,2,some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers what kinda of containers or size of container was each sample poured in to and finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water why couldn't they just leave it how it was
860,1,3,one piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers a second piece is to know samples of what the first step says 4 samples but can they be anything lastly i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment i should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that
861,1,2,after reading the group's procedure i think that they should say in their chart how much vinegar they put in the identical containers also they should put in the chart the time difference or did they do it at the same time and what kind of containers did they use beaker test tube a regular container
862,1,3,to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the samples two how big the pieces of rocks are if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers do they need a lid to cover evaporation how large are they more specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here
863,1,0,3 place marble limestone wood and plastic into separate containers p 4 let them sit for 24 hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water p 5 allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes
864,1,2,the additional information i would need would be how much vinegar to pour into each container also how long it rinse after the 24 hours and a problem statement said also be necessary
865,1,2,in this experiment the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure when it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the containers it doesn't tel me how much i should fill in them step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container it doesn't explain the sample also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples
866,1,2,first you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent next you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds
867,1,1,when simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate they should start with the same ammount of mass ea each sample so the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally by the same wage it is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar b c the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible
868,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed the size of the container needs to be determined also the procedure just says four different samples it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be rinced for if those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated
869,1,1,there is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot you need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup if you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct you should have the vinegar at a constant measurement
870,1,2,first you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container second you need a control for comparison purposes third you need to state the size of the containers
871,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to why they are preforming this experiment and what it is trying to prove you would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to keep that a constant lastly it would be important to know the amount of each sample to add to the vinegar so that the samples aren't different because that could vary your results
872,1,1,the additional information that i would need to know how many of each individual sample i am fiding the mass for p they didn't say how much marbles or limestone or wood or plastic they just said a sample
873,1,2,additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how many m s of vinegar would i pour into the four containers also i would need to know what material to put in each container i would also need to know the measurment
874,1,3,in the students procedure you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rinse with in order to increase the validity also they should specify what type of container to put each sample in such as a test tube or a beaker the students should specify what samples to use in step 1 as well so that when replicated the same samples will be used
875,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment one would need additional info that the group left out of their procedure the group needs to include the problem a hypothesis of what they're testing materials they need to perform the experiment and a conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right the group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed
876,1,1,how much vinegar you will need to put in the container what is the control variable what's the dependent and independent variable
877,1,0,what you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours and not any other time how you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min
878,1,0,in the experiment they wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone the one that went down the most if the experiment was for an hour it would double
879,1,1,1 how much of each sample should i use to replicate the experiment p 2 how much vinegar should i use when replicating the experiment p 3 what should i use to determine the mass in my experiment
880,1,1,to successfully replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials i would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar the final piece of information i would need to know is how much distilled water i am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples
881,1,0,to make a hypothesis p after to make a conclution p determine if the investigation is good or bad
882,1,1,to replicate this experiment i need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the begining and the volume at the end of the experiment
883,1,2,i would need to know what the four different samples of material i was massing were i would need to know how much vinegar to add i would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found in the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment goggles hat
884,1,2,they need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container they need to tell like where they will place the containers if it has to be in warm place or room temperature they have actually determine the mass
885,1,2,to be able to do the same experiment exactly the way the group of students did i would need the amount of vinegar in each asp i would also need to know the environment around the samples for example the temperature they were left to sit in lastly i would try to keep the starting masses about the same for each material and give the number in the procedure
886,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know what kind of sample material is needed how much vineagar to put in each container and how much of each sample is necessary to get the best results
887,1,2,after reading the groups procedure i would need additional information in each to replicate this experiment for example i would need to know how big should the containers be to put the sample then how much vinegar should be added to each container finally i would need to know if all the four samples be put in the container at the same or will it affect the final results of the experiment
888,1,2,to replicate this experiment i would need is know what type of sample i would need to measure the mass additionally i would need to know what kind of containers to put the samples in also i would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment
889,1,0,you would need to know first the materials needed for the experiment then if the materials are listed it will be easier to use them later on in the procedure second you will need to know how to measure the mass like with a triple beam balance also you will need to know how to remove the samples from the container would it be necessary to take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples
890,1,2,what kind of containers big small what are the samples they don't tell us what they are they could be anything you don't know there rocks until you look at the data table in this they say to place a sample of a material into a container and label what sample what material what containers and what are we supposed to label the sample or what is being put into
891,1,1,in order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions
892,1,3,to replicate this experiment you would need the following information you would need the amount of vinegar the students used you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used
893,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the ph of the vinegar and the room temperature
894,1,3,a the group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample p b the size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment p c would need to know what materials to gather
895,1,2,i would need to know what are the samples like the ones they put in their table at other ones they don't state what the samples have to be they also don't say how much should the samples weigh they also don't say how much vinegar should be used should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts
896,1,2,after reading the groups procedure i would need to know the most important part of the experiment the samples i would use in the procedure the group does not say that you need marble limestone wood and plastic additional information i would need would be how much of each sample i would need because i may need a band or ocuple of ances and i would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample
897,1,0,this table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables it's still missing the control group the indepent variable is the change in mass the purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples
898,1,2,the three additional information you would need for a complete procedure for acid rain would be telling what each sample was in order to do the project and also how much vinegar to put inside each separate container and last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process
899,1,0,well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples they vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water
900,1,0,the additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment is determining the mass of force different samples make sure you let it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers
901,1,1,i would need to know how much vinegar was used i would also need to know what conditions the container was left in when it was left for 24 hours lastly i would need to know more specifics about the sample materials such as what type of wood or plastic was used
902,1,1,additional information that the group would need in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started a final statement at the end of the experiment to clarify whether or not their procedure was accurate one important thing they need to mention in this procedure is what four different materials we are using
903,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment the group needs to clarify a certain mass for all of the samples otherwise the data can be affected without this constant also it is important to include what samples are from since the data table clarifies that marble limestone wood and plastic are the specific materials used this needs to be included in the procedure finally the group needs to include a specific amount of vinegar paired into each cup so that variations in the amount of vinegar don't affect the validity of the experiment
904,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know first or all what each sample is they would also need to know how much vinegar to use on the materials lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material the would need and the substance size
905,1,2,additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be what the sample are how much vinegar i am supposed to pour into the container and lastly how do i determine the mass of each sample in other words what type of measuring device do i use
906,1,1,to replicate this experiment first off i have to know which sample is which when recording the mass i will not know which belongings to the correct sample also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with so this needs to be clearer last of all in order to replicate this experiment i need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers because different amounts of vinegar can change the results last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples but i do not know ways to remove those samples in a seperat cup or container
907,1,3,so additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
908,1,0,you would need the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
909,1,2,you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container you would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the containers in addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else
910,1,1,additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container if you do too much it's or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn't without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down
911,1,0,what is the independent variable and what the devendent variable also don't p forget about the control
912,1,0,in order for or to replicate the experiment the chart needs to show every pice of the experiment like what hapend when you put vinegar on four separate pices but identical containers on how you put one pice of of material in one container and label them the doing the with the remaining samples one pice of material in one container for all of it each by showing all the data then you'll be able to replicate the experiment
913,1,2,one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar in step 2 to pour into the containers another piece of information that would be helpful for this procedure is how much of each sample you need to put into the container in step 3 a last thing you need to know is how long do you rinse the sample off for in step 4
914,1,1,1 you need to know the amount of vinegar being added p 2 you need a controle group p 3 you need to know what your labeling each container
915,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how to find the mass of the samples possibly using an electronic balance i would also need to know how big of a container to use sometimes if you have a lot of vinegar the results will be different i would also need to know the purpose of the lab is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the sambles
916,1,0,i would need to determine the mass of four different samples also place a sample of one material into one container and label and after 24 hours remove the samples frim the containers i would have to do the mass of grams for the samples
917,1,0,make sure to include at least three pieces of information samples have lost in for mation because iget information sample allow the samples to fit and dry for 30 minutes p because determine the mass of each sample
918,1,1,first would want to know what materials i would be testing in the procedure the students do not povide a clear explanation of what is being tested also how do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers they should specify if we need to use forces to move them or not the acids on our fingers could affect the samples they should also describe how to figure out the mass the way they wrote the procedure makes it so that one would not know what device to use to figure their new mass
919,1,1,to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you could use such as marble or plastic you would also need to know how to determine the samples and to find the difference in mass at the end between the starting mass and the ending mass of each sample
920,1,2,the additional information you would have to indicate this procedure and you need to know how much vinegar to put in the container how big the containers are and how you determine the mass of each sample
921,1,0,i think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment
922,1,3,some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need the size of the containers used in the experiment you would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period
923,1,2,some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar i would need to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is if i can use more than four samples
924,1,2,to replicate the groups procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container you would also need a control which would be all the sample in water and you would need to know where to keep the samples and what environment they should be left in
925,1,1,in this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate it the students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good however it does not state what the purpose is here i think the purpose is to test permeability at the samples you would also need to know what samples you could use
926,1,3,after reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the
927,1,3,in order to replicate the acid rain experiment we must know more than what the group has given us for example in step 2 the students don't tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container they also don't tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of in step 1 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples they don't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples another problem is that they don't tell us what the samples are until we see the data table they should say it in the procedure
928,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used also you would need to know what size and shape the samples are also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesn't state
929,1,1,this procedure is not very specific in its description for one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples it does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample it also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for
930,1,1,after ending this groups procedure i have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each container they should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up wh we are going to replicate their procedure
931,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinaggar they poured on the three samples the size of the samples and the size of the containers we would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did
932,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the containers i would also need to know how much of each sample i would need to get before testing lastly i would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results
933,1,2,the group was not very specific in their procedures in step 1 they say determine mass of four different samples samples of what they never say they also say to let it sit for 24 hours where should it sit in the light or dark if i were to follow the procedure the group wrote i would probably not be able to control the variables in the same way that they did without guessing
934,1,0,some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis this is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with you would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams
935,1,3,we would need to know how much vinegar to use in each contaner also what type of container shold be used and if we're usin pure vineger or if its a solution lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours
936,1,3,i would frustred to know where is being tested another word the specif materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment
937,1,1,some additional information that we will need in order to replicate the experiment is the materials that are needed the other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over
938,1,2,to replicate this experiment you would need to know the exact amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be different also you would need to know the temperature of both the vinegar and the water you used you rinse the samples in and the outer temperature where you let them sit for 24 hours
939,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment there would have to be instruction on how to find the mass of ann object the word sample should be more specific so it's absolutely clear what should be placed in the containers lastly there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container
940,1,3,after reading the groups procedure i would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment first i would need to know what type of material is being used another thing i would need to know is where to keep the material in sunlight in darkness outside i would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup
941,1,1,are other information you might need to redo this lab is after what time did they messure the samples again now much vinigar they used and what progress the samples made inbetween
942,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table
943,1,1,to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup you should also use the same mass as in the original experiment and you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry
944,1,1,after reading the group's procedure the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of times to do the experiment how long to let the sample sit each cycle and i would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container also i need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more fluent so that way you can know what your dealing with
945,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples time and containers so you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects
946,1,2,in the procedure it should inclode the four samples being massed without this knowlege the experiment would be hard to repeat they should also tell of the meathod they are using to mass the four samples yet another thing that should be added to this procedure is what type of container to use in the experiment these 3 changes to the procedure will make the experiment easy for replicate
947,1,3,since the groups procedure is a little vogue in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know some additional information first you'd need to where to let the sample sit and dry because that could make a difference and you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container since that mass to be held constant finally you'd need to know what are the 4 different samples to use you know by looking in the data table when they don't list items in the procedure
948,1,2,after reading the groups procedure additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment and most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow
949,1,3,in order to replicate the groups procedure i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed with these pieces of information i could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results
950,1,0,in the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment the students listed everything but they didn't give us the time they started so you will know when to start the 24 hours so you can drain them and let them come out
951,1,1,i think that if this group that did the acid rain investigation should of recorded the temp of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry
952,1,0,four different samples p pour vinegar in each p place a sample of one material p after 24 hours allow samples to sit out for 30 min p determine the mass of each sample
953,1,0,you would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours label what liquid you used for this lab
954,1,2,you would need to know what samples you would need to use how much vinegar to put in the container say if there was any repeating the trial
955,1,2,after reading the groops procedure some information i would add is how much vinigar to put in the cup i would also say that maibe they should have mention what the room temp should have been when they left it over night because this temp could change the results of the experiment and they really dont have a dependent or independent variable
956,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is then i would need to know what the three samples are i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use the amounts are not specified finally it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be
957,1,2,in order to replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know specifically what four samples are being tested how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what kind of balance scale should be used to determine the mass
958,1,2,it is necesary to have a constent for each of the four different samples the constent would be using water instead of vinegar in the containers with the the samples also the students did not state how much vinegar they put into each container
959,1,3,after reading the groups procedure there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the expirement in the procedure the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass also the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers last but not the least the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples
960,1,0,to replicate the experiment you will need determine the mass of four diffrent samples allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes place a sample of one material into one container a label repeat with remaing samples placing a single sample into a single container
961,1,2,the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are how much vinegar to pour in to the containers why to rinse the samples out with distilled water what letting the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes does and what i will measure the samples in to find their mass
962,1,1,the students in the group should have the starting mass be the same for the samples in order to give accurate results also to replicate it i would have to know how much vinegar is being poured into each container last the amount of distilled water for each sample should be specified
963,1,3,the information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers the size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment
964,1,2,some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the amount of vinegar put in each container you need to know what the four different samples are and you need to know what unit to use when measuring the mass of the samples
965,1,3,i would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on i would also need to know the problem to this experiment i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment
966,1,1,in my opinion they should add more informations of the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature they should do more than just one try with each sample it should be at least 3 to get a better data they should have measure mass much more often as well
967,1,3,in order to replicate this i would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for so you don't know what to test also around how much of the samples do you need 100g or 50g or 10g also how much vinegar to pour into each container they must should be specific they could have also added what to measure in grams kg lo etc they should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in light dark warm cold
968,1,2,there are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment first we need to know how much vinegar to add in order to keep the amount constant and get results like those given what size and configuration should the containers be it says identical but does not specify anything else thirdly how do we determine the mass of the samples
969,1,0,atleast three pieces of information i would need to replicate this experiment is 1 what safety equipment should i wear 2 the exact way to extract the samples from their containers 3 what do i need to determine the mass of each sample
970,1,3,first at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there in step 2 you need to be told how much vinegar to pour in step 5 it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry then in step 6 once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples
971,1,3,you would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use the size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment
972,1,2,the additional information needed to replicate this experiment included the starting shape and size of the sample how much vinegar is being poured into the container and last what is being used to determine the mass of the samples
973,1,3,in order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information one piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container you also need to know what the conditions are made out of the last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container
974,1,0,i dont think i would add any additional information the procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational
975,1,3,to replicate the experiment i would have to know the size of its containers i use also i would need to know how much vinegar they poured in lastly what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment
976,1,1,in order to be able to recreate this experiment i would need to know what is in the cups i am assuming that it was same type of acid because the marble lost 4g the limestone lost 1 3g and the plastic lost 1g the acid in the cups would have eaten away at the materials and different acids have different rates of corrosion so i would need to know what acid acid and its ph in order to recreate this experiment
977,1,3,to replicate the experiment a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample they would also need to know what containers they used a person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment
978,1,0,this experiment would need alot more information for it to be repcated it will need a control groups so they can compare it to the rest of the variables understanding that there needs to be a consistant amount of vinegar and starting material would help the outcome of the experiment it is also important that the materials are the same shape and size so they have the same surface to volume ratio
979,1,2,without the table a lot wouldn't be known by looking just at the procedure first in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what four samples you would be taking the mass of second you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers lastly in order to replicate the experiment the person would need to know how much distilled water should be used to rinse the materials it would also help if it was specified in the procedure with what should the person be finding the mass of the materials balance in what unit grams
980,1,1,the procedure did not tell the reader that they would have to record their data this is important to replicate the experiment because if you do the experiment without writing anything down you can't see the results as well you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers and have it be the same amount for each sample you might also want to include the difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings
981,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers have vinegar is in and now much distilled water to rinse each material rilin without much details the experiment that i would conduct would mass likely give me different results that the groups of students
982,1,3,the additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be how much vinegar to pour in the containers how big do the samples have to be what should the labels say on them how much water do i use and how long do i rinse for and how do i measure the mass
983,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment the group of students need a control in warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar in the first step the students need to identify the fast different samples that are going to used experiment on also the procedure did not identify how much vinegar should be needed to pass on the samples this additional information would make the experiment more valid as it will be will be easier to follow
984,1,3,the group of students didn't specify what samples they were referring to secondly they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers they didn't give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3 or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4 all of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment
985,1,0,1 determine the mass of four different samples p 2 instead of pouring vinegar pour a different kind of liquid p 3 use three different kind of containers to see what happens p 4 after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water p 5 allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min p 6 determine the mass of each sample
986,1,1,to replicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time
987,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container the group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment
988,1,2,if i was to replicate the experiment i would need to know how to get the mass of each sample material i would also need to know how much vinegar you need and i need to know the size of the cups they are using
989,1,1,to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples and what yourdetermining the mass of in their procedure it doesn't say how much vinegar they used nor the measureing tool they used it also doesn't provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of
990,1,2,after reading the groups procedure a few things are missing i would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment by having all the mass's the same it would be easier to determine the difference i would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get also some information such as how long i should rinse the samples for after the 24hours would be helpful in the replicn of this experiment
991,1,0,if you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you
992,1,2,how much vinegar to use the temperature the experiment was conducted under how much of such sample should be used
993,1,1,say the amount of vinegar put into each cup how do you determine the mass and
994,1,1,how much vinegar do you pour in the four containers
995,1,3,in this procedure the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used all this information is needed to replicate the experiment
996,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each in order for the experiment to be replicated the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly you also need have a control which would be one of each placed in distilled water the mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material
997,1,3,how much liasis was used in each container rinse with distilled water for how long how much the container have to be
998,1,2,one piece of additional information would be to give a specific amount of vinegar you would pour in rain container another would be to give the weight of each of the sample and make sure they are all the same one more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the containers
999,1,2,they need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable they also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid another thing is they don't mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar this is needed for comparison a control one with just pure water is needed to increase validity
1000,1,0,additional information you wold need for this experiment is how much water was in each cup you should also know if all the materials are close in size
1001,1,1,in these procedure it's not explained what this sample is that there putting in so if we knew exactly what is was it would help there should be a control with containers without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar the last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use
1002,1,2,after reading this procedure the students could add the amount of vinegar in number 2 that you would pour into the different containers another thing the students forgot was the different samples what are they they need to include marble limestone wood and plastic into the first step the last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end
1003,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the ammount of vinegar in each container i would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and i would also need to know the size of each container
1004,1,2,one would need to know maly things in order to replicate the group's procedure we would need to know how much vinegar was poured in each container how much sample to put in the containers and how big the containers are themselves
1005,1,3,first the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container also the group should use a control in this experiment to replicate this experiment we will also need to know under what coniditions the samples an the vinegar woll be in we would noed to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference
1006,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into
1007,1,3,we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container it would also be helpful to know the size of the container size of the sample to use the process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information
1008,1,1,the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar howa you need in order to perform the experiment also it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need
1009,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much mass of each sample i would need i would also need to know what i should use in order to calculate the masses another thing i would need to know is what material i am massing they dont tell you any of that in the procedure i also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment but if the same amount isn't used each time then it won't be a control
1010,1,2,in order to replicate the groups experiments i 'm going to need to know how much vinegar i need and how large of containers i need
1011,1,2,additional information that i would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar they soaked the samples in and how big the containers were that they used and i would also need to know what shape the samples are
1012,1,1,the students can include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured into the cups how much of the material they will to put into the containers use the same amount of mass for each object
1013,1,2,the additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is that new and how much vinegar in the container then also need to specify what material to put in the vinegar and how to determine the mass of each material
1014,1,2,for this experiment to be repllcated there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the 4 different materials also what would those 4 materials be it never states what materials to use how much vinegar should be poured into cup p should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things there also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water
1015,1,2,after reading the procedure additional information that you would need to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar they poured in the four containers explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used
1016,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i am putting into the four containers
1017,1,0,1 one thing that could be added to the procceger is that you could try using another liquid rather than viniger 2 another thing that you could change is add two of each type so there would be 2 stone types 2 plastics and 2 woods 3 instead of rinsing each sample after 24 hours you could messure the mass with the viniger and then rins it off and measure without the viniger
1018,1,0,the additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment would be the time the example was started the difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more mass which sample had the least an explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
1019,1,0,repeat step 1 6 p round this data for the 2nd trial p compare the 2 trials and find the average mass for the four samples p observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment
1020,1,0,additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure write you need to make a data table to record information form a hypothesis and you would need a control
1021,1,2,1 what are the four different samples p 2 how much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample p 3 how are you going to measure the mass
1022,1,2,to replicate the experiment you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers there needs to be a control and you also need to know the shape of the objects because shape could have an effect on how much material gets dissolved
1023,1,1,they have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment p they have to measure the amount of vinegar p they have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples
1024,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment there is some information that wasn't involved that is needed first in the product it just said pour vinegar it didn't say how much which is important another important factor that would be needed is in what temperature to let the samples sit and deap in in steps it justsaid let it dry for 30 minutes to didn'nt sayat whattemperature finally when step 4 says mix with distilled water it doesn't say what temperature the distilled water has it just says distilled water i would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be
1025,1,3,i would first need to know what material the samples know and i would need to know how much vinegar i would also need to know how big each sample should be also how big the container would be
1026,1,1,the information that i would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used the other thing i would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with which is the starting mass last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment
1027,1,3,you need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers you also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in also you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min
1028,1,0,one piece of information i would want to know is how big each piece of rock plastics wood
1029,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need a control such as water to compare the results to you will need to know how much vinegar to include in the cup you also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of the samples that is the additional information you need
1030,1,3,1 what kind of samples p 2 how much vinegar p 3 what kind of container
1031,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much of each sample to use it is important to only vary the type of sample rather than varying the initial mass too i would also need to be able to know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically storing the samples is another vital area in this experiment the temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment
1032,1,1,the people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what matterials to use first also they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense also they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure
1033,1,0,first you need vinegar you must put some in four containers then place a sample of one material into one container and label then after 24 hours rinse each sample with water after that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample
1034,1,0,in order for me to replicate this experiment i would have to know how i would determine the mass of each samples when do you pour the vinegar in the containers and what does distilled water mean
1035,1,0,in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need a mass scale vinegar containers stickers for labeling a watch or timer and paper for it to dry after rinsing it i would also need samples of marble limestones wood and plastic
1036,1,1,the information you need in order to replicate this experiment is how much of each sample you are putting into the containers maybe you should also state what the containers you are using look like
1037,1,3,to replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar different environments could affect the date third you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data
1038,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment one piece of information i would need to know is what materials are needed for the experiment i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container the students should be more specific in giving the directions well they never tell you how to find the mass of the samples or the temperature the vinegar should be becare sawing is in they should make sure the directions are more clear and simple directions like gather materials and clean the area at the beginning end
1039,1,0,write down the results that you come up with record your data weigh the samples so you could determine what the mass is these are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed you would also need the total of all the samples
1040,1,1,how much vinegar should they put on each containers
1041,1,3,additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is in the procedure it needs to be more specific and staff what kinds of samples you are using marble limestone wood plastic also it needs to say how much vinegar to pour into each cup and what kind of cup to use also how long you should rinse each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly be more specific on how to dry the samples should you dry it with papertowel and then let it sit for 30 minutes or just let it sit
1042,1,2,the groups procedure was missing the amount of vingar to put into each of the containers how big each sample should be and what to weigh each sample on
1043,1,3,the additional information needed would be the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup you would also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in lastly you may need to know that the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic
1044,1,1,the additional information needed is the amount of vinegar put into the containers they had only done the procedure once to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times they have to get the exact or the same containers to get a fair result in the procedure it says 2 pour vinegar in each of 4 separate but identical containers
1045,1,2,after reading this experiment there is a lot i'd need to know how much vinegar are they adding to each container they need a control group in this experiment to rounenst results i would also need to know what sample goes in each container
1046,1,0,make sure they start with the same mass
1047,1,1,after rending the groups procedure there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be what type of samples i use the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure it doesn't tell me why to do these a final piece of information i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass instead of determine the mass of four different samples they can say use a to measure
1048,1,2,if you were to replicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the containers you would also have to know what kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass
1049,1,3,some information i would need to have during the procedure would be wither or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass also i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and finally where do i pour the samples when filter and after the containers
1050,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment you would need four samples the sample materials should be marble limestone wood and plastic also you would need vinegar to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples additionally distilled water needs to be used to rinse the materials four different containers to hold the samples and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples
1051,1,1,i think that these braid made to for the
1052,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the the types of materials where also how much of each material would you need in order to be able to do the experiment then it says you measure the mass of each substances you would need to know if they found the mass in the cups or not that could affect the out come if you don't know
1053,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample they put in the containers you would need to know how big the containers were and finally you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers
1054,1,0,they could have added all of it up and come up with a average and they could have come up with the mass for all of them
1055,1,3,to replicate this experiment i would need to know what four different samples i am getting and how to measure the mass what containers do i put them in how much vinegar do i put into the containers do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours do i cover the containers how do you measure the ending mass of each sample
1056,1,3,to replicate the experiment you would need to know what samples to test how much vinegar to put in the containers and the temperature in which the samples are kept for 24 hours
1057,1,3,in order to replicate group's expirament we would need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the containers and we would also need equal amount of each samples we would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container
1058,1,0,you would need vinegar in each but 4 separate test taab's label them with what they are then wait 4 awer's and see the mass change in the object's you put into the vinegar over night
1059,1,1,if i would replicate this experiment i would add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass i would also add that you need to calculate the difference between the masses i would also add to the procedure that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sample
1060,1,1,you would need to know what kind of material was used marble limestone wood and plastic what would happen if the samples cud not dry within 30 minutes if you could not let them sit longer or if it was crushal that they would only sit for 30 minutes lastly you would need to know how you determined the mass of the samples what do you use to measure the samples and when
1061,1,2,first you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container also you would need to know what type if container to use next the student should have put how he carried the sample and how rinses it off exactly in order to replicate it another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another
1062,1,1,additional information needed is you would need to know is what the mass from the camse containers when they were full you need to know the four different samples how many containers you need
1063,1,1,1 you would need an expiremental control having just vinegar p 2 no more than one trial for each sample to have precision p 3 you would need to label how much vinegar would be put in
1064,1,0,first additional information would be to measure the starting mass of each sample before step 3 then after step 6 find the difference in mass of each sample the step before step 1 should be to collect all the samples
1065,1,1,i would have to know how much of each sample i would need to put in the cup as well as needing to know how much distilled water in needed after the 24 hours also i would need to know where to place the containers after they need to sit for 24 hours i would need to know all of this if i wanted to replicate the experiment
1066,1,1,additional information that would be needed top replicate the experiment is the type of different samples i would also need to tell us how much vineger to put into cups if they do not spesify then the results may come out completly different they should also determine how to mass the materials and what measurement they would use
1067,1,3,after reading the group's procedure i realised that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the name of the four different samples you need to know the samples are limestone wood marbles plastic or the person doing the experiment would not know what the samples are you also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container and the size of the containers used
1068,1,3,the first most dmas piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the expirement you cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use the next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be you should not have to guess what or appropate size should be also the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container the amount of vinegar needed is essential information also the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored for example should they be left covered or not
1069,1,1,you need to add to number 4 it should say how much distilled water for number 24 it should say how much vinegar
1070,1,0,those pieces of information you need to replicate this experiment are from the samples in 24 hours pouring vinegar into four seperate but identical containers and to allow the samples be dry you also need to determine the mass of the samples first
1071,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment three more pieces of information i would need to figure out are how much water to rinse the samples with where to place the containers during the 24 hours under sunlight in shade and also what size the container is and what shape one more piece of information we would need to know is how many more trials to preform will all that new information i will be able to preform a more valid experiment
1072,1,2,in the procedures the group should have told wat the 4 different samples where also could add a control for this experiment they also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added
1073,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment the students need to specify what types of samples are needed to be used to find the mass the students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar another thing the students needed to include in order for someone to recreate the experiment is to include what to label the container step 3 was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container they also should add more trials for more accurate results
1074,1,0,what would need to replicate the experment is the mass of four diffrent samples vingar cotainers and water
1075,1,2,this group's procedure was good but some additional things i would have added was the number of samples i determine the mass of the different samples i believe that they also should have added the amount of vinegar they were adding to the identical containers they also should put how much of the sample to put into the containers
1076,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment a list of materials should be included especially the dependent variables marble limestone wood plastic it is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table each substance marble limestone wood and plastic should replace the word samples in step 1 the procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables because some sample retain water better than others wood retains water better than plastic there is also no indication when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples in addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grams
1077,1,0,to replicate the experiment i need four different example then i need to pour vinegar in each but identical containers then i need to place a sample of one a material into one container and lable then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes finally determine the mass of each example
1078,1,0,you will need to repeat this information an over again to see how your score comes out to be and if your not satisfied then you can do it over again to see if it's right
1079,1,2,in the given procedure it would help replicate the experiment if is included in it a list of what materials were used this is important to know as well as how much vinegar should to used to pour into each beaker if we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found also it may help to have the four samples start made at tha same mass so you don't get skewed results
1080,1,3,the first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples they also need to tell you to find record the starting mass of each sample you'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs finally they need to say at what temperature they should sit room temp
1081,1,2,after reading the groups procedure there are some pieces of information that are not given for example the group does not say how much vinegar was poured in the containers they don't state how they find the mass of each sample lastly they don't give the names or amounts of each sample
1082,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would needed to know the different types of samores they should add that to the procedure another important piece of information i would need to know is the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the containers also i would need to know what the control is they don't have a control to show how the others were affected
1083,1,3,the three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are diffrent it's easily affected the final result
1084,1,1,first i would describe the materials i am using because in their procedure they only told us their putting vinegar in them they didn't say what
1085,1,0,what type of marble limestone wood and plastic did they used
1086,1,2,to replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing you also need to know how much vinegar you using you may also need to know how much you
1087,1,0,needed to replicate this experiment
1088,1,2,you would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used you would need to know how long to rinse the samples for as well as the amount of distilled water beeing used to rinse them
1089,1,2,i would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar i put in container
1090,1,0,the information that you will need for the experiment is the results of the whole information following the dependent varable and indepennet varable
1091,1,2,three aditional pieces of information that are needed to do this procedure are how do you determine the mass how much vinegar do you need in each cup and they should have written the four diffrent samples in the procedure
1092,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinager to pour into the containers tell what the different samples are in the directions and to be sure about the answers perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again
1093,1,0,need to follow the procedure also need to know them too
1094,1,1,to replicate the groups procedore i would need to know how to determine the mass of the different sampes such as what would i use another piece of information i would need to know is how much vingar should i poor into the the four identical containers and the last thing i would need to know is what would i use to determine how much the mass is of each sample after sifting in vinegar
1095,1,0,you may also use a couple of samples incase you make a mistake while you are putting that one sample in that container you never know you can mes up
1096,1,3,you would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not as this would affect the amount of mass lost you would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass you would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use
1097,1,1,in order for you to replicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup how much water you need and the amount of vinegar
1098,1,2,after reading the procedures the additional things i need to know is what size containers how much vinegar to put in the containers
1099,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you need to know the mass for each sample if it's the same or not you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the containers the given procedure doesn't tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers
1100,1,2,three things that should be included in this procedure is first it doesn't say how much vinegar is needed second it doesn't state what are the samples like what rocks they are it should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble a third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this a fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with a fifth is that it should be stated whether or not there is a control in the experiment
1101,1,2,additional information you would need to repeat this experiment would be what kind of samples are being placed in the vinegar also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container
1102,1,1,in order for myself or another to accurately replicate this acid rain procedure line two would have to be edited from pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers to pour amount in ml of vinegar in each this extra step will help with the validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate in order to help someone else or even them self replicate the experiment accurately
1103,1,3,in order to this experiment to be replicated i would need to know how many or what size samples i should be weighing how much vinegar needs to be poured what to label each container and how long i need to rinse each sample only if i know these specific details will i then be able to complete the experiment like the other group
1104,1,1,one thing they can improve their procedure by is stating what to measure the mass of the rock with most likely they should use grams or miligrams also they should have a step for recording their data finally the should say that in step 3 all cups should have the same amount of vinigar they should also add a control
1105,1,0,what we need is two determine the mass of the samples and the label and they reely need to rinse it more
1106,1,1,in this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers you would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material this would allow one compare each sample effectively in step 4 the procedure says to remove the sample in order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers
1107,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment there are 3 things that you would need to know the first thing is you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers the second thing that you would need to know is how much of each rock sample to use in this experiment lastly in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to measure the dryed rocks
1108,1,0,what you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures
1109,1,2,additional information you would need to replicate this experiment include the amount of each sample used the materials used such as equipment to mass each sample and amount of containers needed also you would need to know the amount of vinagar poured on each sample
1110,1,3,additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the containers at the beginning of the procedure also what type of containers should you put the samples in how big should they be another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right
1111,1,2,if i was going to replicate this expirment i would need to know what the samples are how much vinegar i need to pour in the containers and if i should measure it before i start
1112,1,0,the information that i would need to order to replicate the experiment would be what the purpose of the experiment is they give me what to do but not what i'm looking for
1113,1,2,some additional information this group would need would be a dependent variable they would also need to tell how they rinsed the samples how much vinegar was used how much of the samples were used it doesn't say how much was used in step 2 or 3
1114,1,2,the three thing's that i think the procedure could and should have had but didn't was the type of container to put the sample in how much vinegar to pour in and what to determine the mass with these things are important because if there are differet type's of container it might effect the results if one sample has more vinegar than another it will not be accurate and the mass can be done on many things
1115,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container you also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample'' also step 3 should be switched with step 2 in order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment
1116,1,3,the procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked first there was no specification regarding the samples the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested let done specify which suitably materials were used marble limestone wood and plastic they also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at as well as' the concentration of the vinegar with important measurements that can pontentially affect data
1117,1,3,i would need to know how much vinegar they used how big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using
1118,1,0,step 1 should be to gather each materials p you need to know what materials to use p step 7 should tell you how to do the graph
1119,1,2,one piece of additional information that i would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each of the four containers this is important because thew vinegar is what caused the samples to lose mass so the amount of mass lost in each sample if the amount of vinegar is inconsistent then the data won't be valid i would also need to know the amount of each sample needed and the mass of the container
1120,1,0,find the difference in mass
1121,1,2,after reading the groups procedure the additional information i would need is the amount of vinegar used how to find the mass and the room temperature in order to replicate the experiment
1122,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment they would need an equation to work with a table of ingredients and the conclusion
1123,1,3,to replicate this experiment i will need to know the size of the containers in which i should pour the vinegar the amount of vineger and the size of the 4 materials
1124,1,0,the starting mass the ending mass the difference in the mass label the samples
1125,1,2,the information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what material i am putting in the container i need to kind the control group indipendant variable dependant variable control variable also what temperature they were in and what i am lableing the containers
1126,1,1,they should have told what they were using to weight the materials and they should of said how much vinegar to use
1127,1,2,to replicate the experiment i would need to know the substance used as the sample i also would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup the starting incas for the sample would need to be identical for all other samples being used in the experiment
1128,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i need to know how much vinegar i should put into the four seperate containers i would also need to know what temperature i should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours i would need to know where i should place the containers too for example in light in dark place or have it exposed to sunlight
1129,1,2,i would need to know how much vinegar i was pouring into every cup i would need to know what the samples were in the procedure i would also need to know to record the data and take observations
1130,1,2,one piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples in order to replicate this i would need to know what samples they placed into the containers
1131,1,1,to replicate this experiment i would need to know what type of measurement item i would need to determine the mass of each sample also i need the names of the samples that i need to use such as marble or wood lastly i need from the procedure a control because i need to be told what i am testing for
1132,1,3,in order to run this experiment i would need to know what samples are being tested i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution i would also need to know what size the container should be that i'm pouring the solutions into
1133,1,3,what are the four different samples there is no control so how do you know what water is how much vinegar do you need to put into the containers how big does the sample need to be
1134,1,2,some of the things i would like to know is what are the four identical containers what are the sample and what are they testing for exactly
1135,1,3,there are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
1136,1,0,the group would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion of what happend in this experment these 3 things would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are trying to figure out
1137,1,2,i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup i would need to know how much distilled water i would need and how to determine the mass of each sample also how big would the cups have to be
1138,1,1,the information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are a control group also what are the four different samples another additional information would be a graph to chaw what happened and a conclusion
1139,1,0,you would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers let it sit for 24 hours remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water and then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes
1140,1,0,i would need to know why wood did not change why limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
1141,1,3,in order to complete this experiment i would need to have
1142,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to add what samples you are using like marble limestone wood and plastic you would also need to say how much vinegar to put into each container and lastly you need to say too also determine the difference between each mass
1143,1,0,record mass of all different samples record the starting mass of each sample record the entry mass and the difference in mass
1144,1,0,place a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samples meaning a sample into a sangle container
1145,1,1,this group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to replicate this lab experiment one additional information they could have added was the messures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials did they use a scale of a halause another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment lastly the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with
1146,1,3,you would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample you would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar
1147,1,0,in order to replicate this experiment i would need four of the different mass samples and also pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers and place a single sample into a single container for 24 hours and after that remove it and let it dry for 30 min and determine the mass of each sample
1148,1,3,the replicability isn't very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled variable like 100ml per container also the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the containers at for 24 hours at so the repelilicn can have the same temperature also there should be a certain amount of time to rinse the samples with distilled water such as 10 seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed
1149,1,1,the experiment is and requires everyday materials if i did this experiment i would include the temperature of the vinegar and the measured amount of vinegar in each container
1150,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what the four different samples were the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the containers and i would need to know the problem statement i would need to know these things because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without them i wouldn't know what i was testing for
1151,1,1,additional information i would need to know to know is how much vinegar i would need to put into each up this information would make sure that i get the same results every time instead of putting too much or too little of the substance
1152,1,0,some additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment is more information how much time and hold in order to determine the mass of each sample also instead of containers use glass bottles
1153,1,0,clearly this group procedure is not clear they ask you to determine the mass of four different samples they did not state which samples they also did not state what unit of mass to use when weighing the objects without that i cannot be sure if my data will be reliable
1154,1,3,you also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container what types of container to use and how long to rinse the samples with distilled water in order to replicate the experiment
1155,1,0,to replicate this lab you would need the samples to be the same masses also the amount time you let the samples sit has to be the same then you would have to remove the samples and completely clean them
1156,1,3,i would need to know the certain type of 4 samples i would need to use to complete the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so i would have unreasonable results i would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment whether it it is big medium or small it would also help to show the problem so i would understand what i am trying to investigate
1157,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
1158,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment i would need the marble limestone wood and plastic to be the same starting mass that way i could tell which one is mot effective with vinegar easier
1159,1,2,some additional information would be 1telling at the start of the procedur what you are using as materials 2 tell what the three samples are and 3 describ how much vinegar goes into each container
1160,1,2,in order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information we would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container we also need to know what the samples are for the experiment third we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish
1161,1,3,in order to replicate the group's experiment i would have to know more information for example it says to put vinegar but it doesn't say the measurement of how much would be needed it would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in lastly the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar
1162,1,0,the additional information i would add would be what was the starting before the whole process before the eu hours occurd
1163,1,3,the additonal information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much of each sample and what kind you would also need to know how they determined the mass you would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup it would also be helpful to know what kind of environment the samples would need to be in
1164,1,1,the pieces they forgot to include were how much vinegar did they use to test each sample and also how much was each sample used in this investigation also they forgot to write how long you need to leave the vinegar in the containers was in the substances
1165,1,1,the additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment is 1 to gather all the materials 2 tell how much distilled water how big each container was p 3 record data
1166,1,1,the additional information needed is the amount of vinegar in each sample the amount of sample poured in each containers and in the end of the experiment the procedure does not tell you to weigh the ending sample without this information you cannot fulfill this lab to get the data recorded in the table
1167,1,1,to uptake this groups experiment i would need an additional information i would need to know how much vinegar to add the containers also i need to know how much of each sample to pour in the containers and lastly i would need to know what to unlike on the containers
1168,1,3,the first thing i would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4 also the procedure should saw what the 4 different samples are marble limestone wood plastic also after placing the samples into containers i believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others
1169,1,0,which material you are using for the experiment also record their masses before the vineger and also when it's in the vinegar you also might want to mass the cup filled with vinegar to see how much grams it had gained with the material
1170,1,0,the additional information you would need in order to replicate the expierence is the 4 samples the starting mass the ending mass and the time also the difference in mass
1171,1,3,in order to make the group's experiment more replicate the first thing that should be done is to include the they materials used as independent variable secondly how much vinegar should be added to each sample thirdly in order to both make the experiment more replicate and improve the validity a control should be tested in an experiment like this the control could be either the ending materials left dry or they can be sorted in distilled h2o
1172,1,2,to replicate this procedure you would need to know many things for instance you would need to know how big the container migt contained each separate sample were you would also need to know how much vinegar was placed in the containers you would also need to know how many kmrs the group repeated the procedure to know if is was accurate
1173,1,1,after reading the groups procedure to replicate this experiment i would need information such as the amount of vinegar used to make acid rain i would also need a control group as well as doing the experiment at least 2 more times to have more accurate conclusion
1174,1,2,the changes they could make are p 1 have an exact amount of vinegar they use in each container p 2 they should repete the experiment more then one time p 3 and they should make sure they have the same size of each material
1175,1,1,you would need to write down in the procedure to record the starting mass and the ending mass you would also need to record the time that the samples were being listed last is how would need to determine what kind of container the samples was being shown in
1176,1,1,first you would need to gather all of your materials that is important because you don't want to start an experiment and not have every thing ready second you need measurements of how much vinegar or every experiment would be different lastly you need to remind to make a control group to compare results
1177,1,1,you would need the the for sample rocks vinegar but what we don't know is how much vinegar fore the plastic containers put the rocks in the containers in different and then tape and label what kind of rock then pour vinegar leave for 24 hours to dry to used which stone is better after 24 hours time to longer from the container leave stons sitting for 30 min to dry so that they can be examined but each or that you should measure the mass of rocks in amount of viner thats being put in then after 24 hours measure mass and record all the data
1178,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps a few steps that were missing would be the amount of vinegar poured in each cup how long to rinse the distilled water and also where to let these samples dry off at
1179,1,0,change the amount of havre p leave the samples to sit and dry for more or less than 30 minutes p pour vinegar in each of for separate but different containers
1180,1,1,one thing you would need to know to replicate the experiment is what the temp of the vinegar was because that can affect your results another thing you wouldneed toknowis how much vinegar was put into each container because that could also change the results the last thing you would need to know is what they weighed the objects on because if you use another type of scale it could change your results
1181,1,3,some other information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar you would put in each container how big should the sample be in question 3 and how much water do you rinse it with in question4 also the students can describe or tell you what kind of containers to use like a dealer or a test tube
1182,1,2,the additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the different samples the amount of vinegar that each container would need and you would have to have labeled each container in order to know what samples where going into which container
1183,1,1,the group should include more information about what problem they are investigating there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to replicate the experiment would be the amount of marble limestone wood and plastic the students need to say exactly how much of each of these substances they used they would also need to specify the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers so that there is and an exact identical amount
1184,1,0,you would need at least 4 containners some vine gar and label stickers also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass
1185,1,1,these students should say what the sample's were that they used for example they could say for step one that you obtained a marble limestone piece of wood and a piece of plastic i would need the four sample's inorder to complete this task secondly i would need vinegar in four separate containers lastly i need distilled water for the sample's and i would need a weight measure to check the mass of all four or any samples
1186,1,0,maybe put more mass in the wood and leve it in longer than 24 years and period in for 10 mins
1187,1,0,in order to duplicate this experiment i would need to determine the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
1188,1,0,after reading the students procedure i though that they needed to add some things in their graph what about the 24 hours didn't they say after 24 hours but did they do this experiment at school because if they did then they can't stay in school for 24 hours a day how about the containers lastly negative numbers in mass i never knew that you can have negative grams
1189,1,0,well they all got diffient number of there project cause of the marbal got 9 8 limestone got 10 4 and wood 11 2 plastic 7 2 for the starting mass 5 project
1190,1,3,we would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment we would also need to know what kind of container they used these two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original we would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio lastly we need to know the concentration of the vinegar
1191,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of the sample is put in also how much vinegar to pour in i would also need to know what i am measuring the mass in grams etc if i had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment they also need say where to place the samples a counter in the sun in the closet they say nothing also the biggest of all what am i taking this for
1192,1,1,the group's procedure is not very well done in order to replicate their experiment the procedure would need more controlled variables it says pour vinegar there is no precise measurement this could lead to varied results the procedure also lacks multiple trials the experiment was only completed once in order to be replicated multiple trials as well as controlled variables are needed
1193,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup used also need to know what mas are taking the aid how range are the sample that is a using
1194,1,3,i would need to know how much vine
1195,1,0,the reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish
1196,1,1,after reading the group's procedure you would need to know the problem in order to formulate a hypothesis the materials so that you could directly replicate the procedure and the validity of the experiment so that you could repeat the experiment and conduct further trials in order to perhaps acheive more accurate results
1197,1,3,it is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container it is also important to know how long to rinse them with distilled water or how much water should be used the group should also write in their procedure whether or not they should cover the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in
1198,1,0,the procedure that is determine the mass of four different samples pour vinegar in each of four separate but idential containers after of one day remove and allow the samples for 30 minutes
1199,1,2,to make the procedure correct the group would have need to tell me how much of a sample i can use or should use also how much vinegar i should use and the size of the containers without that information i could not replicate this experiment
1200,1,3,in order to appropiately replicate this experiment you would have to record and compare the results of the difference in mass in all four or if different substances also in this experiment you would have to add to the procedure the temperature of which the substances will be present in making sure they are all the same also one piece that have to be added to this procedure is the amount of time the scteanst would take to rinse the objects with distilled water also in this experiment it should be retained the total amount of vinegar that is placed into the identical cups and then should be removed after the substance is taken out
1201,1,0,you are going to need marble limestone wood plastic and vinegar
1202,1,0,you will need to do the same steps over but you need to be safe with gougles apnn maybe gougles
1203,1,3,you need to know the amount of vinegars you poured the size of the containers you are using and all samples must be put in the same areas because the temperature and sunlight's does changes the result
1204,1,2,some additional information i would need to repeat this experiment would be the amount of vinegar used in each cup the how much distilled water to rinse with as well as the amount of time spent rinsing
1205,1,3,the first thing neccassary to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each contain the second thing neccasary would be how long we rinse of each sample with d water the third thing we would have to know would be the volume of the containers
1206,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container also i would need to know what samples i am using i would need to know what size or shape of container to use finally i would need to know exactly how each samples is to be put in and removed from the container
1207,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how to determine the mass of the material what the containers are made out of and on what material should we let the samples dry on
1208,1,0,after reading the groups procedure the additional information i would need is to determine the mass of each sample at the beginning also to determine the difference in the mass at the end of experiment
1209,1,2,i would need to know how to determine the mass specifically the size the materials containers were and any other controlled variables such as the type of vinegar or the temperature to the containers at for 24 hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight
1210,1,1,the additional information i need in order to replicate the experiment is independent and the dependent variables the materials needed to conduct the experiment this experiment also needs trials
1211,1,3,one additional piece of information you would need to replicate the groups procedure would be the type of vinegar they were using this is key reguarding the reactions of tha samples solidify and structure another piece of information i would need would be hoe much vinegar to pour in each cup lastly i would need to know would be the temperature at which to start the samples while emerged in vinegar
1212,1,2,you would need to include how much vinegar to pair into each container if you were labeling each sample after you washed it with distilled water and what kind of samples they are
1213,1,0,what was the mass after 30 minutes p what was the mass after 24 hours p what was the influence between each time
1214,1,2,to replicate this experiment i would have to know the problem and how much vinigar to pour into each container how much water do you rinse them with and for how long
1215,1,1,in order to duplicate this experiment i would need a list of materials what kind of samples and simpler steps
1216,1,1,to replicate this experiment you would need to know what samples to use it does not state what samples were used until the data table was shown
1217,1,0,the mass use different mass different type of materials and different containers
1218,1,1,for the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you would need to pour in each cup for each sample i would need to no what kind of wood or plastic and how much of each sample should be used
1219,1,0,i'll make sure that when i'm going to end the mass i will remember to not add a later any chemical or anything else to the ending mass so it won't turn out to be a negetive or a zero as the disposure in the mass
1220,1,1,i want to know if the containers are the same size also how many times you have to do this experiment until its accurate
1221,1,0,the additional information you would need is the procedure you would need the marble limestone wood and plastic you also need the starting ending and difference in mass
1222,1,2,indicate what 4 miterials you are finding the mass of how much vinigar must be poored into each container recording data along the way is important and not on the procedure
1223,1,1,first the students should have specified what four samples to use in the first step in step 3 the students should have told the reader that the samples were to be placed in the containers containing the vinegar also it would have been a good idea to have included a step at the phd in which they would have to repeat the lab for accuracy
1224,1,1,in this procedure would need to be given the names of the samples and also in the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and also cleaning up in the end
1225,1,0,i would need p wood mass starting 11 2 ending11 2 p marble mass starting 9 8 ending 9 4 p plastic mass starting 7 2 ending 7 1
1226,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar would be added to each tube the group also need to specify what the samples are also they never put a step in to weigh the marble before the experiment procedure was over
1227,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know how much vinegar we add in each sample we testing 5 lbs 2 oz etc also we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open also what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours darkness light both this is what we must know to replicate this experiment
1228,1,1,to repeat the lab the students are the information i would need is how much vinegar they used for each piece
1229,1,0,the three pieces of information needed is which container kept the same mass when vinegar was poured which container lost less mass which container lost more mass you could also need to pour more vinegar to each of four separate containers
1230,1,1,after reading the groups procedure there were many piece of information they could have added one by showing how much vinegar was used in the test tube another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as their control the group did not mention a control if there was a control it would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water lastly the group could have shown that they used two or more trials
1231,1,2,to recreate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar would be poured into each of the containers you would need to know what the samples are how much of each are you would need p a k a amount of vinegar p what kind of material the samples are made of p how much of each sample you'll add
1232,1,2,additional information that you would need to repeat this experiment would be one how much vinegar is added to each separate container two how much of each sample is added to each cup three what you are measuring the weight in four what temperature the samples be kept at for 24 hours
1233,1,0,the information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is why would you need identical containers material and vinegar
1234,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to
1235,1,2,to replicate the experiment you need to determine how much vinegar was used in each cup for this experiment you also need to determine the tempature the did the experiment take place and how much of the material was used
1236,1,2,in the procedure more specific information is needed such as the steps to determining the mass of each sample how much vinegar should be poured in the four seperate containers and into what containers and with what do you label them with with more specific information this would be a well written procedure
1237,1,0,the students should include which is most resistant least resistant and how many drops of acid rain vinegar they put in
1238,1,0,i would need to know how to determine the mass of each sample i'd need to know what to lable the containers i'd need to know how to preform the steps not just what the steps are of the experiment
1239,1,3,in this experiment many things were not mentioned in the procedure that was crucial in order to replicate it first was that the names of the sample were not given so we don't know what to take the mass of second was that it didn't tell how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginng of the procedure lastly we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24 hour time period other than this the experiment was written decently
1240,1,0,before the students put the objects in the solution they should have weighed each sample the students also should have had a control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct to make their experiment better they should repeat the experiment more than once to see if their data matches
1241,1,2,the additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is poured in to the containers how much of the sample material should be massed and should the same sample be used tofint in to the single container specify in the procedure what kind of sample materials to use
1242,1,0,the 3 key materials that i need to replicate this experiment is vinegar a few plastic containers and a triple beam balance
1243,1,0,if you want to replicate the experiment you would need to get a new starting mass ending mass and a difference in mass you will also need to find new rocks to experient to find different mass of each rock you will also need new vinegar so they dont get mixed up with the other vinegar
1244,1,2,the additional information you need to replicate the experiment is how big i refer the containers what temperature was the room at to make it dry how many items of material were put into each container
1245,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment i need to know what the samples are such as wood or marble i need to know how to find the mass of the samples such as by using a triple beam balance and i need to know how big the samples should be
1246,1,3,some additional information that would be needed to replicate the acid rain experiment may include the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into the containers also you should know the room temperature and to make sure the room keeps in steady temperature throught the experiment lastly in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much distilled water to use and how should i dry it
1247,1,3,i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container i would need to know what temperature the samples were in and if that temperature remained constant for the 24 hours i would also need to know how i would rinse each samples with distilled water without losing any sample and i also need to know how many times i would need to rinse the sample in order to remove all of the vinegar
1248,1,3,they would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are another major thing they forgot to mention is what the climate of were the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours are they all in the same spot as in dark or light thease are some key things that need to be included
1249,1,1,they should label the materials makes sure the scale is calibrated make sure you have a few days to do this lab
1250,1,3,to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant the containers that the materials are put into would also will have to be the same size to keep everything the same the materials would have to be rinsed with the same distilled water and set to dry in the same temperature environment
1251,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know which types of samples to begin with marble limestone wood plastic you would also need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in the containers for step 2 and lastly what unit of measurement should the mass be recorded in
1252,1,3,some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed for step 2 what size you need to make the samples key and what kind of container you need to put the samples in
1253,1,2,what temp is everything they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar also repeat twice
1254,1,2,you need to know how much distilled water to rinse it with you also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container you need to know how bigof a container
1255,1,2,additional information would include what were the four different substances how much vinegar was put into every cup also how much water was it rinse with it could also tell you figure out the difference
1256,1,0,we would need to know the time between the starting point and the end point
1257,1,1,the additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that you need to pour in the containers how much of the sample that you will use and what will you use to determine the mass of the sample
1258,1,2,to replicate this experiment i would need same additional information i would need the viner what type of container to use how long i should since we sample with distilled water for and water to determine the mass of the samples were and samples the experiment finished
1259,1,0,the most weak sample was limestone because it lost 1 5g of mass the other don't have much difference the stranger samples in the acid rain is wood because didn't lost a gram
1260,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment i would have to know the hypothesis of the experiment because i am ensure of what i am testing for also the problem to know what i am trying to prove and the conclusion to see what resulted from the experiment without these pieces of information included it is difficult to realease the experiment because you were only given the procedure and not the full lab report
1261,1,2,one piece of additional information needed is how much vinegar you would put the samples in another would be how much of the samples that is not specified the last piece of additional information needed is how long do you rinse the samples for
1262,1,1,to replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps first of all they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples also they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded also they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass
1263,1,0,you would need to pour vinegar in each of 4 seperate size identical containers place a sample of 1 material into a container and lable do the same with the other samples
1264,1,0,to order to reapit this experiment i need the number of mass limestone wood plastic how much zone i have to doesn't tell us we need to reapit the steped we need to know how long time we need to do the trials to know if the on same is right
1265,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would need corr
1266,1,3,additional information that i need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be poured in the containers and if it should be the same amount in all more information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water lastly information also needed is where to put the samples for the 24 hours it doesn't say if the samples were put in different locations
1267,1,0,measure the amount after the 24 hours place the 4 different samples in 4 different places temperatures and leave samples in their area to dry
1268,1,1,when they are going through the procedure they did not include the names of the tested items they also didn't say what they were testing it for
1269,1,2,after reading the procedure there were 3 things missing the three things were hour much vinegar did you put into each container how much water do you use to rinse each object and how long do you rinse each object
1270,1,0,the mass of four different samples p the time for them to sit p the purpose of the experiment and wich sample p distilled water better
1271,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment we would need to know how to determine the mass in steps 1 and 6 or what instrument to use we would also need to know exactly what kind of identical containers they want to use in step 2 finally in step 5 we would have to know how and where to let the samples sit and dry
1272,1,2,you would need to know why you are pouring vineger into 4 masses you need to pour the same amount of vineger into each sample and also you need to include 4 designated samples and say liquids or solids
1273,1,3,after i read the groups procedure i determined that you need to know how much vinegar to pour in the contain in step 2 another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need the last piece of information you need is what size container should you use
1274,1,2,additional information needed is how much vinegar to use on each material also good additional information would be to tell where they left the containers with the materials
1275,1,2,1 in the procedure include the names of the materials that will be used during the investigation p 2 how much vinegar should be in each cup p 3 include with what we should determine the mass of the samples
1276,1,3,how long the samples how much the vinegar at how big should containers be
1277,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know were the samples were some may have been warmer then others and some may have been cooler this may have been effected the experiment
1278,1,2,the group stated to determine the mass of four different samples samples of what they should have been more specific on what four samples they did the experiment on they stated four vinegar in each they did not tell us how much vinegar to use also the group did not use a control group to show the difference in mass without the control group
1279,1,0,what was their prediction before they start after check if their prediction was right or not
1280,1,0,to reeplicate the procudure the additional information i would need include which samples of materials were placed first to last and basically in counts of even seconds which materials were processed longer into the vinegar filled containers
1281,1,0,i would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak make sure they are dry before making on don't let any types get mixed up
1282,1,2,the group would need to include in their proceedures how much vinegar would be used because that would impact the results they should also include the size of the seperate identical containers which could also impact result the group could have also included information about the vinegar's temp which is an important constant
1283,1,2,we need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples it would also be helpful to tell us what unit to measure the samples and what size test tube to use then the lab would be performed correctly
1284,1,2,you would need to know what materials to use the amount of vinegar to use and
1285,1,3,in order to replicat the expirement the procedure must tell us what materials they use for samples they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four containers they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in and how long you rinse each sample in the distilled water
1286,1,0,well im not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer but i think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck up more because wood suck any liquid up so it would have a different answer
1287,1,1,additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the cups what the samples you're using or and what your control group is going to be there are important parts of the procedure that are missing
1288,1,0,i would have 4 container caled the 4s marble limestar wood and plastic so the readers can know whats in the containers then poured a even amount of vinegar on each samee let it sit dry out for 24 hours deterime the mass i got at the end culd compared it to the mass i got in the begeing vig
1289,1,3,to replicate the experiment one would need to know how much vinegar was used it would also be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used to replicate the experiment one must know what the samples were in the procedure and the containers they were put in
1290,1,2,i would need to know how to measure i samples i would need to know how much vinegar o put in each cup should place it on in the shade
1291,1,0,hypothesis to take a guess wether the mass of four samples 1 of they was going to be right p independent dependent variables in the students experiment p results the would didn't have any difference in mass and had the starting and ending mass were were the same 11 2
1292,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment we should be told the amount of vinegar in m ls and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator
1293,1,3,to replicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples you would also need to know how long to rinse the samples you would also want to know how they dried the material if you want to get the same data
1294,1,2,in order in replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the separate four identical containers you would also need to know how the mass of the sample was examined where type of scale and should the sample the measure what substance are now indicated all of the crucial elements stated a hour needed to marry out the experiment are not ntuing or missing not mention the lack of a control to compare results to
1295,1,2,what the samples are what type of containers
1296,1,1,additional information that is needed to be able to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar is being poured into the different yet identical containers
1297,1,1,another important piece of information we would need to know is how much vinegar would need to be put into each cup because if we poured more vinegar into one cup and a little into another cup the results may vary
1298,1,2,i would need the size of the containers how or what the temperature of the water that they used to rinse the samples
1299,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used how moch sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at
1300,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done one would be to say how large each sample should be it should also include what type of sample is being tested another thing would be to include how much vinegar to use another good thing would be to have multiple trials
1301,1,1,you would would need to know how many trials to do for each sample to make an effective experiment you would need to know what to measure the mass in to it sound reasonable in the data also you would need to pour in each of the four separate containers all this information would help produce a successful experiment
1302,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would first need to know how much vinegar to use also the amount of time its supposed to sit for most importantly you would need to lable each container with the difference in each one
1303,1,1,you should obtain 4 seperate containers and then mass the container so you can subtract the weight of the container when you mass the samples this will give you just the mass of the samples not the samples and container combined the amount of vinegar to add to the samples should also be determined more clearly
1304,1,1,the group in this experiment can do
1305,1,0,you would need vinegar a sample material to put into a measurement and label them also you would need four identical containers this is to replicate the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass that is what you would need to replicate this experiment
1306,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers you would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completly you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completly submerged or if it was floating on top
1307,1,2,after reading the group's procedure and making of the student's data recorded i would say that they are mostly a few total information in some for one to replicate the experiment one such information is how much vinegar in some they used on the samples also what they used to determine the mass of the samples lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information
1308,1,1,i would need to no how much vinegar you would put into each cup how they determined the mass and how much of each sample did they use in each individual cups
1309,1,0,starting mass ending mass change in mass
1310,1,0,the additional information we would need to replicate the experiment would be the conculsion
1311,1,2,additional information i would need to repeat this experiment includes which four samples we are testing how much vinegar to pour into the separate containers how much of the a sample to put into the vinegar what i would put the samples in after i remove them and how i would determine the mass of each sample these things are needed to replicate the experiment exactly or else i would not be able to know the directions and do the experiment the same
1312,1,2,well first off you need to know how much vinegar to add to each container an how much of each sample an what type of vinegar i would be more specific
1313,1,3,additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples i would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment also i would need to know how much vinegar needs to be added to each stare should it be submerged or not also i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor what is the temperature lastly i would want to know the acidity of the acid aka vinegar
1314,1,2,you need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers you need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples
1315,1,0,make a data table to record each sample and the starting mass also record the ending mass and the difference in mass also record the lowest and highest mass
1316,1,2,in order to repeat the experiment by looking at the procedure one must know what the four samples are the amount of vinegar for each sample should be known as well also the person performing the procedure should know how much of each sample to take and what type of measurement to use when determining the mass grarns
1317,1,1,with step number two how much vinegar should you pour p with step number three what sample goes with what container
1318,1,2,the additional information that we would need is how much vinegar we need to pour on each of the four separate containers also it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label lastly it says to place a sample of one material but it doesn't say what kind of material and in the beginning it says to determine the mass of four different samples but we don't know what kind samples so they should say the names of it there is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure
1319,1,2,where do we keep the containers how much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use
1320,1,1,the additional information that the group did not add in was how much viniger was poured in each container if each container had different mass of viniger then it will affect the out come of the samples you must have the same amount of viniger in each container and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible
1321,1,2,one thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long they rinsed each sample with distilled water
1322,1,1,you would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how much of a sample to test in the experiment also if the mass of each sample is different for example marble being 9 8 grams plastic being 7 2 grams and wood being 11 2 grams how is the mass of each determined
1323,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information you would need to know materials the 4 different samples are how much vinegar was used wether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar without this information our data could be different
1324,1,0,some additional information would be make sure the sample is dry to do anything else next make sure you get all the data and make a chart
1325,1,2,to replicate this experiment project you would need to know what type of containers were used to add the vinegar and how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers also you would need to know how much each sample you need to place in the vinegar how much distilled water you need to rinse it with and how well
1326,1,1,you would need to know what material the samples were made of you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container you would need to know how much of each sample to put into each container
1327,1,1,to replicate the experiment i'd need to know how much vineger to pour into each sample i'd also need to know what to lable each sample and how much rain to put in each cup
1328,1,2,i would need to know how big the containers were how much vinegar to use and what amount of each of the 4 samples to replicate the experiment
1329,1,3,to repeat the students experiment you would need to know additionaly to the procedure
1330,1,1,after reading the groups procedure several things are needed in order for the experiment to be replicated first the four different samples should be identified and the desired mass should be specified also the amount of vinegar added to each sample should be identified
1331,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment you need the starting mass the ending mass and the difference in mass for example the marble starting mass is 9 8 the ending mass is 9 4 and the difference in mass is 0 4 now for the limestone the data the group of students got was 10 4 for starting mass 9 1 ending mass 1 3 difference mass now for the wood students got 11 2 starting mass 11 2 ending mass and 0 0 for difference mass
1332,1,2,how much vinegar to pour in how much big are the containers and which type of scale would i use
1333,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment it should be useful to know how much mass of each sample you are trying to start with each starting mass the group used were different having a significant effect on this results you would also want to know how much vinegar the group is putting into each container also it would be important to know how the group is covering the samples from the containers depending on how the samples are removed could play a major role on the final results
1334,1,1,for step two how much vinegar do you pour in p for step four how do you remove the samples from the containers p for step three what do you label the container
1335,1,1,some additional information they could have added be how much vinegar should be pourred into each container tell how much material they used in each container and stated if there hypothesis was true
1336,1,2,1 how much vinegar should go into each container p 2 why doesn't it matter which sample p 3 does it matter whether the the containers will affect your results
1337,1,1,to replicate the experiment you would me to have the procedures the materials and the time to do this project
1338,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment a few pieces of additional information are needed you wold need to know how much vinegar is being added to the containers you would also need to know how much of one material is considered to be a sample it is neccessary to know how to label the different containers since they are identical
1339,1,2,the additional information you would need inorder to replicate the experiment is tell how much vinegar to place into each containers tell the size of each material such as the marble limestone wood acid wester the should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment
1340,1,0,three pieces of information you need in order to replicate the experiment is a hypothesis first to predict what you think will happen secondly you need the data information like what they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data
1341,1,2,in order for someone to replicate the experiment this group should have immediately include the names of the four samples substances also they should include information about how much vinegar to add to each sample and whether that amount remain constant for all 4 samples this group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment when replicating this experiment it would not be clear to me the purpose of what i am doing and what i am trying to figure out
1342,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup you would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change another piece of information needed is where the samples were placed such as a hot environment or a cool one
1343,1,0,you will need to pour vinegar in four new separate but idantical containers then you will need to get four new samples and determine the mass for four different samples
1344,1,2,for this experiment you would also need to know the equipment and the four samples what were the samples and what else did you need to do the experiment also maybe a specific place to put the sample example light dark rooms and temperature should you do the experiment twice one in light room one dark different temp how should the containers be placed
1345,1,1,to replicate this experiment i would need to know what types of mative i used as so i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said repet steps 2 3 for each diffrent motivel used
1346,1,2,some additional information would need to know is what samples i'm useing which unit i'm measuring the mass in raw much vinegar i should put in each cup this is same information i would need put isn't to evident in the procedure
1347,1,0,you need some pictures and a statement
1348,1,0,1 let the samples sit to dry for different amount of time p 2 try different containers not identical different size shapes p 3 try more than one type of acid besides vinegar p 4 let samples sit larger than 24 hours
1349,1,3,in order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample also you need to know what kind of container plastic metal paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such
1350,1,1,to replicate the group's experiment i would need to know how much vinegar and we would have to label the containers
1351,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment the additional information you would need would be how much vinegar you should pour into the four separate containers in step 2 another piece of additional information would be mentioning the specific samples being used in the procedure a third piece of information would be how much water you should rinse each sample with after the 24 hours
1352,1,0,well you will need the same amount of objects to the other experiment so it could be the same
1353,1,1,you would have to see what is the amount of rain also need all the measurements of the vinegar
1354,1,2,to replicate this groups exiperiment i would need to know how much vinegar i should use what samples to use incase the graph wasn't shown then i wouldn't know and lastly i would need to know how to determine the mass since i am unaware of how to determine the mass in the procedure it should say determine the mass by
1355,1,0,some information you will need in order to replicate the experiment is things such as your hypothesis problem results conclusion etc you will also need to show how you got your results and conclusion
1356,1,3,initially in order to do this expirament one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use the students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistant in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced the students should have included the type and size of the container the apparatis used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
1357,1,2,additional information to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be poured into the containers another would be how much distilled water should be used to use the samples the third would be by what method should the mass of the samples be determined
1358,1,0,after reading the groups procedure the additional information you need is the dependent and independent variable central and costenit hypothesis and problem statement
1359,1,1,the group is missing a whole in 1 of important details i would need to know how much vinegar to use for one
1360,1,0,you would need to tell us how long it stayed out there
1361,1,1,how do you find the mass whatdoyoumeasureon and how much vinigar
1362,1,0,i would need to determine the mass of four different samples then i would sample the marble of the starting mass then i would make sure that i have labeled of all the samples of starting mass ending mass and difference on mass after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry
1363,1,3,other information
1364,1,0,you would to add the labels again then you would have to record your results yet again and then you would check you work
1365,1,1,additional information needed for the groups procedure is that the group should have stated what kind of samples were needed to perform the experiment what also could have been identified is the amount of vinegar the student should pour into the composition the sample another steps that could help a student when replicating into maybe have an exact measurement of the samples instead of having each one vary from 7 2 11 2 for example maybe have each one way 9 8 to see easier which sample to affected more by acid
1366,1,0,the group's procedure is wrong because they need more time on doing this experiment and if the group just work a little more harder than they did before then they still have a chance at passing the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different then they can pass the experiment by taking some bad material out and putting new material in
1367,1,3,first you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup secondly the amount of each substance should be the same next what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide
1368,1,3,additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the containers i would also need to know what type of containers are being used and where to put these containers during the 24 hour waiting period finally i would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it
1369,1,1,aluminum foil black paper is good to wrap around a cup because you could have one cup in any kinds of shape you want to the cup pluse using aluminum foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet the alinum paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out
1370,1,2,you would need to know what materials to get you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup they should have told us what to measure the cup with they should have also told us what type of container to use
1371,1,2,you would need to know how much vinegar to pour list of materials to use and how much of each material
1372,1,2,in order to duplicate the experiment i would also need to know what were the samples being used what king of containers i need size i would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample
1373,1,2,after reading the group's procedure in order to replicate this experiment it must include what types of samples you need how much vinegar to use and you need a control to compare the results a control for this experiment would be to have the four samples sit in water and find the starting and ending mass the procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass
1374,1,3,the procedure is missing some critical info first of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab i would not know what i needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers finally the group did not say the size of the container
1375,1,3,one piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used you would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup you might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same on other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of h o applied
1376,1,1,you would need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups so its easy to tell the different between the three cups in the same temperature because the temperature can slow and speed up the process
1377,1,3,there are several things this group should have included in their procedure they did not specify what type of container or how large they did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container they did not say what to do with the container when you finish they did not specify how they determined the mass
1378,1,2,the additional information i would need to show in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar to use why this experiment is being done what is the purpose of this experiment if so i would need to know the types of materials to use
1379,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into into each container what utensil to use to measure the mass of the each sample and what materials should be measured i e marble limestone
1380,1,2,in order to complete the experiment it would be necessary to know what the four materials actually are the procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials also it is not know how moch vinegar to use for each substance lastly it is important to know how much of each substance to use these three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment
1381,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the sample of the materials is you need to control group and you need to what you label to your containers
1382,1,2,this procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment the necessary samples marble limestone wood and plastic are not listed in the procedure the amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated these are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample marble limestone wood and plastic
1383,1,2,some additional information you would need a control you would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure
1384,1,0,additional information that should be added and to be started with is a breif introduction of the experiment and the purpose of it what kinds of mass should be added in so that can cause confusion the way i know what were tha masses was the students data that was recorded the procedure should also state exactly what neeeds to be recorded like starting and ending mass and the difference in mass
1385,1,2,additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup you would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting also you would need to know what temperature the containers would need to be placed out to receive the most erosion
1386,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment thoroughly one would need to know the approximate size of each sample as a 10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently also are would need to know how how much vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for 24 hours
1387,1,0,well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeate it but don't have to find the mass between each object
1388,1,0,you will need the data chart also the procedure of the exprerement to replicate it
1389,1,2,i want to know how the experiment is related to acid rain because there is no introduction to describe the purpose p how much vinegar would i pour into the beakers p what materials do i need to conduct the experiment
1390,1,0,i would need to know what the outcome was suppose to be or what it was suppose to look like the information given is good but doesn't really explain why they were doing this experiment for but the table was good and understandable
1391,1,2,how much vinegar are whe poring how long are we rinsing them
1392,1,1,the information not included in the procedure that should be stated is the amount of vinegar added to each of the containers
1393,1,1,to replicate the experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each sample in order to get accurate results you would
1394,1,2,after reading the group's procedure one thing they could add is to specify in the 1st step what they're testing for example they could have said determine the mass of marble limestone wood and plastic another thing this group could have done is to conduct more trials of the experiment so that they could get valid results finally another thing this group could have said in their procedure making it easy to replicate is by specifying the amount of vinegar someone should put in each of the 4 containers
1395,1,1,what i would add in the procedure is that i what are the materials you need 2 record your data 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with
1396,1,1,the additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar needs to be put in each container an additional piece of information that would help replicate this experiment is how long should you rinse each rock for because some rocks may absorb water which would add on some weight
1397,1,2,you would need to know how much vinegar would be put into each container how much each sample should be included in each container where to place the containers and then where to place the samples during the their in the containers and out
1398,1,0,after reading the procedure i would like to know the time given for each material also if their were any color changed and what was added to the material
1399,1,2,they should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well p they also should indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample p they should measure the temperature at what they dried their sample
1400,1,1,after reading the group's procedure additional information i would need to replicate the experiment to the different types of samples i would use what to label the samples and what should i measure in
1401,1,2,in order to replicate this groups experiments you would need some additional information you would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers and you would need to know how long to rince each contairer after letting them sit each for 24 hours
1402,1,0,you would need more vinegar and marble limestone wood and plastic to replicate the experiment
1403,1,2,the second step should state how much vinegar is used in step four how much vinegar is used in step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated
1404,1,2,one additional prire would be to state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is being poured in the container another additional peice would be to matie all the materials the same ending mass
1405,1,3,i would need to know what were the four different samples how much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains also what to label the containers and should i leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours
1406,1,3,to replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container it would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be lastly they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking if they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else
1407,1,2,the additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what type of climate the containers have to be in the size of the containers and the thickness of the insulating material
1408,1,0,additional information you would need would be to put more time a sample to write down the starting time ending time try other samples next time
1409,1,0,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know p 1 how they got the mass of the four different samples p 2 a list of constants p 3 you would have to know how much of a sample you would place into the container of vinegar and if it's the same for all four materials
1410,1,2,the additional information i would need is to know what size the containers should be i would need to know what to label the containers also how much vinegar i have to put in to each container
1411,1,3,for this experiment i would want to know how much vinegar i should pour into the cup pouring different amonts could change the mass the other information i would need is if i needed to rinse the material in a timely manner 10 sec 20 sec etc this could also effect the mass of the material i would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size that also could effect the difference of the mass's
1412,1,0,wood starting mass g 11 2
1413,1,3,if someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are used if being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials also the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in there they should also specify that types of containers are used maybe restain types affect the experiment and some don't and they should then made note of that
1414,1,3,in order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample
1415,1,3,the group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container the group also forgot to mention what samples they are using without these 3 main information points nobody could replicate this lab
1416,1,2,to replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the samples were in how much of each sample and what type of containers are being used
1417,1,1,samples of what and what is the purpose of the experiment why should we do it what do we have to do with the data
1418,1,3,additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for finally the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry you need to know whether it should be in a cold wet environment or maybe warm dry
1419,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment procedure should include the names of the four different samples the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup and the size of the four identical containers
1420,1,1,in their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass they would have to state that you need to subtract the starting mass from the ending mass in order to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the containers we would also need to know what the units are if their grams and mls
1421,1,2,after reading the group's procedure some additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separate but identical containers also you would have to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the containers and finally you would have to mass out each individual container in order to get the actual mass for each sample and the mass of the samples to container
1422,1,0,first in order to repeat the experiment i would have to know what's there investigation about and how much of the single sample are we suppost to bot in the container
1423,1,2,some information needed is that they should tell us what the samples are what to measure them in and how much vinigare to use because it will change the experiment alone by not adding the same amounts
1424,1,0,don't know
1425,1,3,after reading the procedure some things are still unclear they should say what 4 samples are being tested not just ''mass 4 samples'' also how much vinegar should we pour and in what sort of container what should we lable the 4 containers as how should the samples be removed from the container and as always what are the materials we need and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety
1426,1,2,some additional information that i would need would be how much vinegar do i pour into the containers in what measurement do i measure the four samples
1427,1,1,one thing that they need to put in their was the amount of vinegar and what was the point of doing these
1428,1,0,the three things that need to be added to replicate this experiment is to place marble limestone wood and plastic each in a different cup filled with vinegar at the beginning you need to determine the mass of a piece of limestone marble wood and plastic at the end after you determine the mass calculate the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone marble wood and plastic by by the ending mass of each
1429,1,2,to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container i would also need to know firstand what my samples are i don't want to look for them in the results
1430,1,1,they would also need to include how much vineagar was needed to add to the samples they also need to include how much of each sample there should be and that you need to find the difference of the mass at the end of the procedure
1431,1,2,to be able to replicate this experiment the group would need to add what each sample is they should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table so that all the information is clear
1432,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of vinegar that i should pour into the four cups i would also need to know where to store the cups it would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment
1433,1,3,in able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added p 1 what are the samples p 2 how much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers p 3 what unit of measurement is used to measure it mass p 4 what kind of containers were used
1434,1,0,you need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy then we get plastic of starting mass
1435,1,1,the additional information that i would need to know is how would i find the mass of any of the materials how much vinegar do i pour in each of the containers what do i do to the materials or containers before i let them sit for 24 hours
1436,1,1,one way they could be more clear is by using how much vinegar into the containers also they can write ho to much of the different are needed and if you need to place the samples in a certain pt
1437,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know a few things suppos the ph of acidity of the vinegar the surface area of the racks can also affect this experiment because the more surface area there is the more stone is in direct contact with the vinegar solution this contact make one each dissolve faster then a rack with less of a surface area
1438,1,1,a tell how much vinegar you used p b
1439,1,2,i would need to know how much of vinegar do i put in the containers how long do i rins the sample for
1440,1,1,what are you going to do after you find the mass of all four samples how much vinegar did you put in each sample
1441,1,0,to replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information an conclusion and a graph
1442,1,3,additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include p what kind of four samples are being used p how much vinegar to pour into the containers p what kind of containers are being used p how to to remove the samples and place them into containers p what to label each of the separate containers
1443,1,2,first of all in order to replicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are also the one trying to replicate the experiment needs to know the exact mass of the samples finally the procedure must tell the one conducting the experiment the exact amount of vinegar to use
1444,1,3,to replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing how much vinegar they used how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used if they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment
1445,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment it would be important that we know the specific pll of the vinegar which is acidic therefore it would be below it we would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment finally the most important aspect of the experiment that would need to be determined before replicating would be the amount of vinegar solution that each sample was placed in the type of plastic is also important to know
1446,1,1,more information that i need is what materials did they put into the containers because they did tell us and they didn't what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers also they didn't lable each measurement on the chart
1447,1,0,in order to be able to redo this experiment you need to have all of the information we need to know more about how they did this experiment more details is better
1448,1,0,the additional information that is needed is how they recorded the experiment they need to separate that experiment more when mac always mineral the determine and compare it to the firod time that you did the experiment tell what happen how in the first experiment
1449,1,1,to replicate this experiment you would need to include pieces of additional information the group of students neglected to specify how much of vinegar that would be poured into each of the containers when you have put a measurement in your procedures it makes it already more ideal to replicate the experiment
1450,1,0,to replicated the experiment i would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at
1451,1,3,to replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use you would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with to replicate this experiment you would need to know what type of containers to use to put the samples in the type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results
1452,1,1,after adding i determined that
1453,1,1,the group was missing how much vinegar they used more trials for each material would improve this lab
1454,1,1,how much vinegar do you put in the cups
1455,1,2,they should describe what the samples are how much vinegar do you put in each container
1456,1,2,three additional pieces of information i would need would be the size of the samples how much vinegar poured in each container and i would need a tripple beam before to measure
1457,1,3,the additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples they should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples
1458,1,3,to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use how big of a sample to use and how long to rinse each sample without these you cannot replicate the experiment
1459,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of each sample that is put into the containers i would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the 24 hours things such as temperature are necessary i would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours
1460,1,2,first their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested also they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step 2 the experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to without a control we don't know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason
1461,1,2,the additional information i would need to complete this experiment is this first i would need to know which one to put in first second how long should i wase wish water then finally where should i let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out so that is the additional information i would need to complete this experiment
1462,1,1,additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers how much material is needed into the container and how much of the samples do i need
1463,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar should be poured in each of the four samples i also need to know how much is the starting mass of each sample and how much is the ending mass of each sample in order to determine the mass of each sample
1464,1,0,tell us to do it again
1465,1,2,one thing i would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container also i would also need to know how long i would rinse the material off far finally i would a need to find out what they used to dry or did they leave it on the table
1466,1,3,in order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to one last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar if when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree
1467,1,0,say what kinds of materials there using why there doing are experiment
1468,1,2,to do this experiment you need to know what the samples are how much vinegar to use what do you label the containes and how do you determin the mass
1469,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know several things first the amount of vinegar added would have to be specified second one would have to observe change in color and size of the samples if any third the procedure doesn't tell you to find the difference in mass which you should
1470,1,3,the students should have included information about what the 'samples' were what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use
1471,1,3,the group will need to put to the following information what are the four different samples what type of containers will be needed also what size they will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar the temperature should be consistant
1472,1,2,i would need the types of sample materials that are being used it does not tell me the amount of vinegar to put in the containers so i would need a measure of how much vinegar to put in finally i would also need to know what type of equipment i would use to measure the mass
1473,1,2,to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container also for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used last you would need to know the size of the container being used and how to determine the mass of the samples
1474,1,3,to replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you're using you would also have to know where you're leaving these containers and lastly to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you're putting these in that and or the size of the original sample
1475,1,2,to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was poured on the samples as well as how much water you rinsed the samples with you might also want to know what temperature this experiment was done in as temp affects the results of them rens
1476,1,3,to repeat this lab i would need to know what kind of vinegar they used how much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not
1477,1,2,after reading this procedure other additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the procedure they should state the materials that there going to be testing instead of saying samples another is they should have more controlled valiable instead of other samples tosit for 30 min they should have more to determine what to do with samples and containers they should have a control to test the results and see how this varied against the control this is the same information i would need to replicate the experiment
1478,1,0,so far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup let silt for 24 hours take samples sit and dry them you would then received the ending mass and subtract the difference
1479,1,2,to replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup another piece of information we need is what kind of samples they are because if the data table was caried the water could not follow the procedure the procedure does not state what the samples are the last piece of information we need is what are we going to use to determine the mass after it sits fo 30 mins it does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass
1480,1,3,one thing you would need to know is what use of containers you need in step 2 they do not say the size of the container they just said you need them also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers
1481,1,3,to replicate the acid baim experiment the samples in step one should be identified to make the directions more clear there should be a set and constant amount of vinegar and the amount of time the samples are rinsed should be included it should also say how to find the mass whether to use water and a graduated cylinder or a triple beam balance
1482,1,0,in order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass cups to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with
1483,1,2,the group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using they also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container the experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening
1484,1,2,you would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar should be put into the samples because if you use different amounts then the result may not be the same as the original thirdly how large each container should be because if the containers are too small some of the samples may leak out and ruin the results for the acid rain lab
1485,1,2,although they got some information i think that in order to replicate the experiment they would need 3 things the first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the containers secondly to determine the amount of distilled water used to wash off vinegar lastly to determine where the samples were staying for 24 hours if they were to replicate this experiment and did these examples that i have listed than it would be successful
1486,1,2,the group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure they also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container they should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container
1487,1,1,they need to measure the amount of vinegar and only put in one container you need to measure the mass clearly not just estimate you get the mass before you do anything to it
1488,1,0,the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment is the materials all the steps that they did
1489,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant you will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each
1490,1,2,the students could state how much vinegar is needed in each container explaining weather the sample needs to be submersed compleatly or not
1491,1,0,after reading the group's procedure to replicate this experiment i would need a scale four identical containers vinegar a sample of marble a sample of limestone a sample of wood a sample of plastic a stop watch water and labels
1492,1,3,in order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things what type of woods plastic limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use how much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not also what siz container another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water and finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed
1493,1,0,i think the project needs to change
1494,1,0,first the stat mass should of been the same it's know a product that they did nothing to they did change anything you can change the time
1495,1,0,it didn't give enough information
1496,1,2,in order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure for instance in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with and specifically which samples also you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers in step 4 the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure can be the result of less accurate results
1497,1,0,1 gather materials p 2 pour 20 ml vinegar in each of four separate out idenical containers p 3 place a samora of the material into the container and label reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container p 4 after 24hrs remove the sample from the containers and rines each sample with distilled water p 5 allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mins p 6 determines the mass of each p 7 clean up where you worked
1498,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers and i'd also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical containers were i would also need to know how much water distilled was used to rinse off the samples and for how long did the students rinse the samples i may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment
1499,1,0,the additonal information youwould need to know is you would need to know if the rock was sitting in the vingeror being shaken if shaken you would need to know how hard to shake it different prosseces are created
1500,1,3,after reading this groups experiment i have found that to do this experiment over again i would need additional information additional information would need would include what kind of container do i put the materials in what size container was used to put the materials in ' what surface or what do i are the materials with and how much vinegar would i put in the if separate containers i would need all this information to perform of this experiment
1501,1,1,in order to do this procedure perfectly you will have to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin in order to have a valid trial of data i would have 3 experiments for the rest of the samples
1502,1,2,after reading the group's procedure i noticed they didn't measure how much vinegar to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the expirement be more exact another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample another is where should the samples sit in sun or indoors this may have an affect
1503,1,1,the group of students didnot tell us the diffrent samples nor did their procedure tell you to find the starting mass and the difference in the starting mass and ending mass
1504,1,1,you need the type of materials needed the amount of materials in order to mix the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it
1505,1,2,the additional information i would need to know in order to repeat this experiment is to know the amount of vinegar in each container the mass of the four samples and to know what are the four samples used in the experiment i would need these 3 pieces of information so i can repeat this experiment
1506,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup and that the amount remained constant throughout the experiment you would also need to know how much distilled water was used to rinse the samples
1507,1,1,a control variable is one of the most important things to include in the procedure and this group did not do so the procedure should also include how much of the vinegar solution should be poured into the containers because a difference in the amount of vinegar could affect the outcome it would also be a good thing to mention to record your information so that you won't forget it later on in the experiment
1508,1,2,in the procedure it does not tell you what the samples are if you need to use
1509,1,2,there is much additional information necessary in these procedure in order for one to be able to repeat it in step 1 the four samples should be specified as marble limestone etc as they were in the data table in step 2 how much vinegar ie in ml should be desorined as well as the type of container a jar plastic beaker etc also in steps vi determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement should be used such as beams lastly there should be a step 7 directing us to find the differences in mass as it does in the data table
1510,1,2,in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need to know at what temperature these samples were kept i would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount lastly i feel that i would need to know what to measure the mass with by knowing this information i would be able to replicate the experiment
1511,1,2,the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample also i would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container
1512,1,2,this experiment will need more trials to see if the results are convincing the group needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials they need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours is up
1513,1,3,what the samples are how much vinegar should be added to each container where the samples are contained for the 24 hr waiting period
1514,1,1,want wise the shops if they wayed with the that they was holdings the thing if it was dry how much rinser did put in it
1515,1,0,the information that you will need is the measurement hypothesis conclusion because you want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things these are the main things you need to replicate the experiment
1516,1,1,you would need the names of the samples you were using
1517,1,3,to repeat the experiment i would have to know much vinegar i am pouring into containers i need to know room temperature or temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rinse the sample for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet
1518,1,2,the students need to have identical materials for this could validate the expirement because mass has an effect on vinegar dissolution a quantity of vinegar needs to be specified as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution finally the temparature of the area in which the expirement is being conducted needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold a constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid
1519,1,3,the procedure given doesn't have enough information so that someone could replicate it what else is needed is to state the different samples needed it also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples lastly we need to know what kind of containers how big each of them are
1520,1,3,you would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it you would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the containers so that the experiment sould be replicated
1521,1,2,some additional infomation i would need to replicate this experiment would be a certain a mount of vinegar i would need to put into each cup exactly what materials i am to add in each of the four cups and also how to remove the samples from the containers
1522,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what materials were used the amount of vinegar that is needed and exactly how the group measured the mass both before and after the experiment
1523,1,0,the students have to measure the four different samples when they remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water they have to measure before the ending mass because it may different than the ending mass
1524,1,1,additional infomation that you would need to replicate this experiment is to remember to write in the procedure to record data also name the four different samples you will be working with also make sure you work with one sample at a time
1525,1,3,i would include what the samples are wood marble etc and would label the containers that way i would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used i would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at
1526,1,1,after reading the groups procedure the additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment would be a control they don't have anything to compare their data to they should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments also they didn't show the number of trials which should be more than one so they could get an average and get more valid data the group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of one material in each cup i have an idea how much one material is
1527,1,0,to replicate this experiment you would need to state you problem what is the person for this lab also you need to indicate your independent and dependent variables
1528,1,3,first you would need to know what materials to use as samples second you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container lastly you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at
1529,1,1,know all the materials they used and what the wight of each of the materials were before they were placed in the water
1530,1,2,the amount of vinegar stated in procedure z p the type of container for each substance p how much distilled water you would need to rinse
1531,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each container how to label the containers and how long to rinse the samples for
1532,1,0,two samples of each material must be collected make two charts one for your first trial and one for the second calculate the averages from your two trials
1533,1,1,after reading the groups procedure the additional information needed to replicate the experiment is a control because there is no control in the experiment the type of containers needs to be known because the size can affect on how much vinegar is absorbed also they do not mention how much the samples are record so their experiment cannot be repeated with the hope of having the same results
1534,1,3,some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container if not specified someone may put too little or too much and the results can come out very differently you would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry
1535,1,3,if i wanted to replicate the experiment i would need to know what kind of containers to use i would need to know if i should cover the samples in the containers i would also need to know what the samples are how am i suppose to know what i am tasting if i don't know what the samples are
1536,1,3,additional information that would be needed we need to know how much vinegar to putt in each sample what temperature to keep sample at and how long to rinse the samples for
1537,1,2,i would need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic some other information i would need is what kind of vinegar they used white or red one last thing would be does it matter what you dry them with just in case it could effect it
1538,1,0,you need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need berck down the steps
1539,1,2,to properly replicate the acid rain experiment you would need more information than is given in the current procedure you would need to know what materials the four different samples are in step one how much vinegar to put in the separate identical containers in step two nd specify each sample goes in its own container rather than only plase in in single sample in a single container
1540,1,0,in order for me to replicate this group's procedure i would need to have the problem their hypothesis also the independent and dependent variables
1541,1,0,i think what i will do is to change the procedures instead of leaving the samples sit for 24 hours i'll let them sit for 48 hours i'll let them dry for 60minsand
1542,1,0,you would need an experiment contron a problem statement and for precision you need more than one trial for each sample
1543,1,1,to replicate the acid rain experiment the group would have to include how much vinegar to pour into the containers what the starting mass of each rock should be and the amount of water the samples are rinsed with
1544,1,0,1 gather materials p 2 put on apron goggles p 3 set up materials p 4 por vinegar into a identical containers p 5 put marble limestone wood plastic into their separate containers p 6 put name on container wait 24 hours p 7 rinse the samples with distilled water p 8 put samples out to dry p 9 determine the mass other differences p 10 clean up materials
1545,1,2,additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things number one used be the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate beakers i would also need to know what is the ml size of the identical beaker of size altered or not the
1546,1,1,first off we need to know how we should be measuring the mass like with what kind of scale they should also specify what units we are using such as grams they also don't tell us how much vinegar to pour into these containers
1547,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what samples they used another piece of information i would need is how much vinegar do i use for each sample lastly i would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer
1548,1,2,in the procedure they never said how to the difference in mass g and what it means also it never said how much vinegar to pour in each container also they never said what of the samples were
1549,1,2,one piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure another would be how much at the sample to put in the container also the procedure doesn't state what temperature to allow the samples to sit when they are
1550,1,1,this group left out some important details when writing their procedure in order to replicate this experiment i would also need to show what i would measure the mass with how the amount of vinegar i should put into each container what the other materials would be these 3 things would help me to replicate the experiment better
1551,1,3,the group neglected to include what the four different samples are they should have said use a scale to determine the individual mass g of four different samples of material marble limestone wood and plastic they also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers they should have included how much ml vinegar should be poured into each container what containers are made of they also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to they also never listed the materials that needed to be used
1552,1,0,the way you would replicate the experiment is by repeating the procedure but just use a different sample ingredent
1553,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what i would measure to measure the mass with a sale second i would need to know to measure the mass in grams third i would need to know if i should round the mass to the nearest tenth or hundreth of the gram
1554,1,1,in this experiment they give all the things you need to do but not with enough detail in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar goes in each container it may be the same but we need to know a measurement also another thing you would need to know is how to label and understand each sample for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container lastly they don't explain how they determined the mass in order to repeat the experiment you would have to know what they used to measure the mass
1555,1,0,the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment form a hypothesis draw a conclusion say what you are experimenting
1556,1,2,after reading the procedure some additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment is a clear indication of what the four different samples are i will also need to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container i will also need to know what amount of vinegar went into each container and if this amount varied between the different containers
1557,1,2,to replicate the procedure you would also need to know that the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic second thing you need to know is what type of wood because some woods are harder than others the last thing you need to know is how much vinegar is in each asp
1558,1,3,one thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment you would also need to have the samples all the same size thirdly you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment
1559,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know which sample is going in which container you would need to record all of the masses of each sample and make sure all the masses are the same you would also have to pour the same amount of vinegar on each sample after the 24 hours rinseing samples and letting each sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample again and see which one is most different in mass
1560,1,3,to repeat the experiment you waid first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers you would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses you waid also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs also what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers where would they sit
1561,1,0,i will need to collect all of my materials i will need four containers and my four samples i will have to place the four samples in the containers then put
1562,1,0,if you want to replicate the experiment you will need more containers exactly alike marble limestone wood and plastic also fresh cups of viniger
1563,1,2,additional information that would be needed is how much vinegar was added to each sample how did the students figure out the ending mass and where did they place the samples in the period of 24 hours
1564,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment it would have been better if they put in how much vinegar to go in each container they could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container they could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use they could have also seen sipecific or what type of container can be used for the experiment
1565,1,3,to replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know what size container to use you would also need to know what the four different samples were lastly you would need to know how long to note samples for
1566,1,3,after reading this groups procedure there are four different pieces of information i would need to replicate this exact experiment one the group must include what the 4 samples are anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing two you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container thirdly they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours lastly i would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers
1567,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information first of all it would be helpful to know how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers also from the student's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are that would also be helpful lastly it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the experiment that they took the difference in mass
1568,1,1,in order to replicate this procedure it would have to tell what the samples are there is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used which could happen without proper explanation
1569,1,0,they didn't come up with the independent dependent variable p make up a question p create a hypothesis
1570,1,3,in order to figure out how to replicate this i would need to know the containers size also i would need to know how much vinegar to put in i would need to know how long to wash with water for
1571,1,2,some additional information that would be needed are specific things first the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers the experiment can also describe the materials since the word materials can mean almost anything the experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar
1572,1,2,to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was poured in the containers you would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and you would also need to know more information on the containers
1573,1,3,after reading the procedure in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample there was also you would need to know what kind of vinegar they're using as well as how much to pour into the container you might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water
1574,1,1,first piece of information i would add is the name of the different samples and how much vinigar was put in to the container when you started then when you finish how much vinigar was in the container
1575,1,0,additional information i would need to replicate this expiriment is how to determine the mass of each sample also to take the masses of the samples before putting them in the vinegar to compare the masses of before vinegar after
1576,1,1,to replicate the experiment they would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container they also need to get rid of the ''determine the mass of four different samples'' and instead say mesure the starting weight of the samples
1577,1,1,you would also need to include a list of supplies a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar and of the samples is needed
1578,1,1,this group needs a control they need something that won't change they also need them to have all the p samples with the same starting mass lastly i was never told how much vinegar i should into the container p that is important to know because you cant guess for how much to put in
1579,1,2,the temperature they were left at know what substance the samples were what temp the distilled water should be
1580,1,3,the groups prosedure could use they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end also list the type of meteral they roused and they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused
1581,1,3,1 you will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at p 2 the surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar p 3 how much vinegar to put the samples in
1582,1,0,in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need to come up with an hypothesis the reason why i am doing this experiment and a conclusion
1583,1,0,while doing this experiment some additional information that you may need to know are what is the reason they are doing this experiment for what is the problem another thing is what is the final anwser that they are looking for they also need to follow the scientific method in order to complete their investigation
1584,1,1,you would need to know how much vingar is need and what is the purpose of the experiment
1585,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put the samples in how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times would be needed to rinse each sample of the vinegar
1586,1,0,to replicate the experiment you would need to know the what the previous problem statement was without a problem statement there is no purpose for doing the experiment you would also need to know who the groups hypothesis was by knowing the hypothesis you'll something to compete with your findings and last the group should have said their control p this will give you data to base your exams findings onto
1587,1,3,the additional information that i would need is how much vinegar do you put in the containers what are the four samples to put something over the containers and what are steps of the samples
1588,1,0,i think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is we want to add it up to see what mass is better we need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one
1589,1,1,in order to replicate this expirement they would have to
1590,1,3,specify what the samples are in step 1 specify how much vinegar in step 2 specify the size of the container in step 2 in step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers
1591,1,3,the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first naming the four different samples given to you secondly you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers thirdly you would need to know how you would determine the mass example with an electric balance the students need to be more specific on their materials
1592,1,1,additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples a control group and a dependent variable
1593,1,0,when the group said to place a sample of one material into the o ther container then repeat it does not make sense because people could repeat putting the sample into all the containers back to back you don't have to wait 24 hours for letting the sample sit in the container
1594,1,2,in order to copy this experiment you need to know what samples to use for example list the marble limestone wood and plastic also starte how much vinegar to pour or how little same with the distilled water and what will you use to determine the mass of the samples
1595,1,1,additional information needed to replicate this experiment can be a number of this one important thing would be how much vinegar are you pouring in the containers without putting the same amount it can change the mass of the samples another thing is in step three the material and what you are labling should be stated how are you going to know what to label it as and what material it is
1596,1,1,why they are doing this exparament what the problem is how much vinagar is needed what is the controll for the experament
1597,1,0,what i would need it to maybe is to let the samples sit and dry for more than 80 minutes p also multiply the last row for starting mass ending mass difference in mass be they repeat it
1598,1,0,additional information would consist of its shape resistance and total masses lossed to complete the experiment
1599,1,0,one piece of information needed to replicate the experiment would be material starting because it could or from the another would be how many of each sample you are puting in the cup and the last could be if there was a control to the experiment
1600,1,1,the additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is to have a control for each of the four different samples also measure the amount of vinegar being poured and 24 hours exactly being washed
1601,1,3,first things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar lastly i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them
1602,1,2,one thing i would need is what the samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything also i would need to know what the containers looked like so i know what kind of containers i should hecking for this experiment last the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change
1603,1,1,in this procedure i would of also mentioned weighing the rocks i would at stated how much vinegar you pour in each container and i would of listed how to find the mass
1604,1,1,some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples
1605,1,0,the following additionnl information i would put is record the difference in mass after the beginning and ending of each mass
1606,1,0,after reading the group's procedure i would need to know what kind of samples was i supposed to got and how much i need to use for this investigation so i can replicate the experiment
1607,1,2,the procedure left out some information that is needed for step three it doesn't specify what material or what size container to put the material in it should also tell you to do repeated trials
1608,1,2,fix this experiment the procedure needs additional information for example the four different samples or how many or what kind of containers then it needs to state how much of each sample this procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly
1609,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers
1610,1,0,maybe after the experiment this procedure should be done a second time to see the results come out the name react ways
1611,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i'd need to know what 4 different samples i needed i'd also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container i'd need to know what i'd use in order to determine the mass
1612,1,0,after i had finish reading the information i think i would need four types of vinegar but identical and four containers then i would need to determine the mass of each sample
1613,1,1,there are three things you would need to know to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you needed to add to each of the four containers another thing you would need to know is if the four samples all needed to have the same initial weight or mass or size lastly the proceedure needs to tell you how to record your data also you need to know what they are comparing their data to their control and constants
1614,1,2,the additional information i would need to know to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar in pouring into the containers what was in each different sample and why they picked the samples i will also need to see the constant and independant and dependent factor
1615,1,2,this group needs to include quantitative information such as how much vinegar this group should try to eliminate the use of the word sample it can be confusing to someone which sample they are talking about i also think it would be better if possible to use the same mass for all samples this will show the change in porportion to how much of the material
1616,1,0,the additional information that you would need is the statement why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong such as this the type of result you were looking for
1617,1,3,you would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers you would also have to know what environment to put the cups in in the sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area p lastly you would have to know what you put then to and leave them on a paper towel inside or on a table etc
1618,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what type of samples i should use in the experiment just saying samples is not specific enough i should have the exact type of material i also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment should i use a lot of vinegar or a little 4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment i also need to know how to find the difference in mass in procedure says to determine the mass of each sample but it does not say how to find the difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment
1619,1,3,1 how much vinegar how big a container were the samples completely covered p 2 what temperature did the samples sit at p 3 rinse samples how long or until what desired effect
1620,1,3,some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used you would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass
1621,1,3,i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup i would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items how long do i rinse the sample in distilled water for
1622,1,1,the first bit of information that you need is how vinegar is needed in the four different containers they never said what to use to determine the mass and they never said what kind of samples
1623,1,3,to replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get i could get any thing i saw and it would fit the description in the procedure you also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them you should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system
1624,1,0,the students would also need to keep recording every thing they see
1625,1,1,1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen
1626,1,2,the procedure does not state what the four samples they are testing they have to be clear and actually name them also we do not know how much of each sample to place in the container it should have a constant mass for each of the samples the procedure does not state how much vinegar to pour in h2o it is very important to know the amount that they put in
1627,1,3,you also would need to know how much vinegar to use what kind of vinegar to use and the 4 different samples
1628,1,3,after reading the group's procedure there is much additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment first off you would need to know what the samples are and what size of samples you will testing another piece of information that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that you'd pour in the containers step two from steps one and six you are supposed to determine the mass of all four of the samples that to do this you would need to know what you are taking the mass in ie grams pounds ouples
1629,1,1,the things that they could've included would be that they need a constant they need to specify how much vinegar is in each container and also to include the number of trials to do
1630,1,3,to replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples in other words samples of what one would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in should the samples be placed in a beaker graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container one would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours
1631,1,2,to replicate the group's experiment 5 other things i would need to know are p 1 what samples p 2 how much vinegar i need to pour p 3 how much of the samples i need to pour into each container
1632,1,3,if i were to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much of each sample was used i would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container also the size of the container would be helpful i might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material
1633,1,1,additional information needed would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container i would also need to know if the sample much be a certain size
1634,1,3,additional information i would need to know would include several things i would need to know what the four samples of material are i would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container i would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be
1635,1,2,first you would need to know what samples are going in the cup also we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup
1636,1,1,some additional information that we would need in order to replicate this experiment is observations of what the samples looked like before during and after the chemical reactions also we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we are just calculating the mass of the four and lastly you need to re check your calculations
1637,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know what different samples to use they show 4 samples in the data table but in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing we would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each lastly in order to replicate the group's procedure we would need to have a control variable that we could compare the results to
1638,1,2,the group's procedure is missing a couple of elements for one they need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sample secondly they need to record the size of each sample they need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples
1639,1,1,in order to replicate the procedure you need to know when other materials you will need what samples you need
1640,1,2,you will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples how to determine the mass of the samples what materials to use for the sample these were additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment
1641,1,2,first you would name the four distrant substances say the size of the container also how much of each substance in each container should be specified overall this experiment needs to be more spesific and valid for this lab to be repeated
1642,1,1,i would need to know what step are testing what the independant variable is what size be samples they are talking about i would also need to know what other variables are controlled
1643,1,2,to replicate the experiment the first thing that a group would need is a control variable second we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their containers in able to complete this experiment lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in in able to have the experiment preesse
1644,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers we also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample another thing we would need to know before we could replicate this experiment what the hypothesis is
1645,1,1,the additional information that would be needed is a control which could be no water added 3 or more trials to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water was used in the experiment
1646,1,1,in their procedure the studants weren't very clear on what the samples were if they didn't have that table i wouldn't have known what their samples were they also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment so if i tried to repeat it i could only guess the materials they used these students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure the way they worded some of the steps was very confusing they needed to make it clearer
1647,1,3,the additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble limestone wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified
1648,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment one would need to know some background information on the properties of marble limestone wood and plastic specifically their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples a second piece of information you would need to know is if there should be multiple trials thirdly one would need to know the effect of acid rain on the samples physical properties in order to determine a valid hypothesis conclusion
1649,1,2,the experimental procedure does not specify the amount of vinegar to be used the mass of the samples to be used or the type of wood and plastic the experiment cannot be replicated without this information because the scientist does not know the amount and type of materials that the group of students used in their experiment it is impossible to know if the experiment being performed is correct if the amount and type of materials are not specified
1650,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing how to calculate mass know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment
1651,1,1,after reading the group procedure i would add what the four different samples were for step 3 i would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps i took after step ca i would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are 1 how to determine the mass and 2 how much vinegar to pour
1652,1,1,i would need to know the amount of vinegar that is being poured in the containers with what am i going to measure the mass of each sample i think that i would also need to know the problem that is trying to be solved specifically what am i trying to find out
1653,1,0,in this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning but it did look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass
1654,1,2,if you were to replicate the experiment described in the procedure you would also need to know some additional information you would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted the procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment it is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples says to use the same scale for all the masses
1655,1,2,to repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container you would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature light exposure and other factors
1656,1,0,determine the mass of four different samples
1657,1,2,i would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers i would also need to know where to leave the containers from temp also what should i remove the samples with tongs
1658,1,3,to replicate this procedure i'll need to know the size of the containers i'll need to know the samples and i'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container the amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample
1659,1,3,the additional information i need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar i pour in each of the containers how big or small the containers have to be and whether or not i should close the containers
1660,1,3,you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours
1661,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container the type of container what they mean by a four different samples if not given data table as well as the form of the rock liquids crushed whole etc
1662,1,2,three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is first how much vinegar do you place in each container what are the samples you should use and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment
1663,1,0,i think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe they could of extended the time so instead of being for 24 hours it can be 48 hours for best results i would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate
1664,1,3,in order to replicate the acid rain experiment it is essential to know what the samples are in the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples what are the samples also how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample in step 2 it says pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers what is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used also in the 4th step it says to rinse each sample with distilled water for long should the sample be rinsed
1665,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment more information is needed it would be important to know how much vinegar into each container it would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be finally to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly it would be important to know what type of wood samples was used as different woods have different properties
1666,1,2,you would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add how much sample to add into each solution in order to replicate this experiment
1667,1,2,one piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar how much should you have in each container another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example 1in 2in marble square
1668,1,3,the additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar
1669,1,0,number 2 pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers this can help determen the mass of eatch item and help with the experement from what we read after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determen the mass
1670,1,0,to determine the mass of four different samples to pour vinegar in four seperate container place a sample of one material into one container and label after 24 hrs remove the samples from the containers allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of each sample
1671,1,1,we would need to replicate steps 1 6 for samples p marbles limestone wood plastic p what kind of containers p if the containers are dry it can change the difference in the mass
1672,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment we would need to know the temperature of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in both of these could vary and therefore change the result of the experiment
2788,2,1,changing the type of grafin would improve the student's experiment give a better new at those data p give the names of each type of plastic type used in this experiment each plastic should be the same length p my conclusion is plastic type held up a much stronger than all of the different types
2789,2,3,concluding from the students data that plastic type b was the stretchiest while type a is the least stretchy two ways that the students could have improved their experiment is to have described how much height to use another way that they could have gotten more valid results is clarify how much plastic to use hanging of the table
2790,2,1,two ways that the stundent could've improved the experiment is by getting a more better brand of plastic or simply redo the experiment
2791,2,1,a conclusion i can make from this experiment is that plastic type b is the stretchable because in trial one it stretched 22mm while in trial two it stretched 23mm without breaking one way the student can improve the design is by adding more weights a second way is to include more trials so there is more to compare to
2792,2,3,a one conclusion i can draw is that plastic b stretched the most than there was plastic d the next plastic c and finally plastic a b they could have used more trials two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment next they could have said how long each plastic had to be if there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid
2793,2,2,my conclusion to this experiment is that plastic sample b streched the most because it was probly a sample streches easily p b two things that could be changed is saying what kind of plastic it was and saying hope much weight is put on each clamp
2794,2,1,you can conclude that plastic b was the most maluble and was able to stretch the most while plastic a was the most rigid and least stretchable two ways the experiment could have improved was to also test for longer amounts of time to see if time was a factor using different wights for different trials could also give out more beneficial data
2795,2,2,by looking at the results one can see that plastic type b and d stretched almost twice as much as the other two types this shows us that b and d are most likely low density polymers because of their flexibility a and c however are not as flexible and therefore are high density polymers the experiment could have been improved by adding another plastic type or running more trials the weights could have been changed also to test the strength
2796,2,2,material type a stretched the least and material type b stretched the most material type b stretched about 12 mm more than a a few ways the student could have the experiment is be could have gotten different length plastic to test it different ways also he could have added more trials and averaged them together to get more accurate results
2797,2,3,a a conclusion about this data is that plastic type a b stretched longer the second trial and that type c stretched longer the first and d stayed the same you can also conclude that plastic b has greatest stretchability b two ways the students could have improved the experimental are sign is that they could have done more trials to increase validity they also could have used the same length of different plastics each time
2798,2,3,a plastic type b is proven to be the most strehable material because it has stricthed to the greatest length which was 22mm and 23 mm b 2 ways to improve the experiment is there should be 2 trials and the size of each material before being stretched should be held constant
2799,2,1,a based on the student's data i can draw the conclusion that plastic type a is the most duriable because it stretched the least an average of 11mm while plastic type d is the least duriable p b to improve this experiment the student's could have added a control and specified how much weight should be added to the clamp
2800,2,3,based on the student's data plastic b stretched more b the students could have improved the experiment by resting the plastics at the same length also by doing more than just two trials using sam putting same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag
2801,2,3,a the students concluded that platic b was the most flexible stretching up to 23mm on the second trial and 22mm on the first b the student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways first he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results second the student could have been more descriptive in his procedure explaing how to add weight to the clamp and how much weight to actually add
2802,2,1,based on the students data it looks like all 4 types of plastic stretched at least 10mm the most amount stretched was 22mm for plastic type b then 20mm for d 14 mm for c and 10mm for a p to make the experiment more valid the student could perform more trials maybe using a different type of clamp or other weights to test the plastic's flexibility
2803,2,3,a conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that plastic b has the most stretchability two ways this student could have imposed the experimental design and or validity of the results is the students could have said what the initial length of the plastic was and keep all the others plastics at the same length because if one plastic was longer than the other the experiment would be valid and they also say how much the weights that were being used weighed because one could be heavier than the other
2804,2,2,a conclusion that can be made based on this experiment is plastic type d stretches the most plastic type d stretches the second most plastic c the third most and plastic a the least most the students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment
2805,2,0,a based on this student's data i conclude that trial 2 was more effective p b one way the student could have improved the experimental design is give the names of the plastics they used
2806,2,1,a in conclusion plastic type a is the strongest plastic and plastic type d is the weakest plastic because it streched the most p b the student should have made sure all the plastic lengths were equal the experimenter should have also tested them all at the same time to get accurate data
2807,2,3,as shown in the data table i can conclude that plastic type b was able to stretch the most in the 5 minutes the table also shows that plastic type a stretched the least concluding it was very strong or had less polymers two ways the students can improve their experimental design would be to make sure that all the plastic samples were the same length another way the students can improve the experiment would be to include the weights so an independent variable can be clearly stated seen
2808,2,1,a based on the students data i can conclude that t2 overall had better results that t1 for t1 a b and c were all longer than t1 p 3b the student could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results by specifying the amount of weight that was added to the clamps and the student should also have specifyed the plastics that were used to make a more valid point p a 10 12 p b 22 23 p c 14 13 p d 20 20
2809,2,0,the second trail the first two numbers are higher then the two in the first trail one number lower than the first time and the number the same one way the could improve there experiment is they could of made a graph with there results
2810,2,1,the question in this experiment is how many weights did it take take for the plastic to inicate while measuring the conclusion was that t2 was more of a success one way the student could have improved was explaing how heavy each weight was and how best you should add each weight to the clamp another way they could've improved was using the exact type of plastic with the same measurements
2811,2,3,a plastic type b is made of the stretchiest material b it does not say how many or how heavy the weights added are causing the results to be innacurate also the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic
2812,2,1,plastic type ''b'' contains the most elasticity the could have explained was some of the different procedures were used for and to be more clear on explaining the procedure because when you explain a procedure you want to explain it in a way that any one can prefer in it
2813,2,1,in conclusion based on the students data collected plastic type b was the farthest stretched one way to improve the validity of their design to have different sizes of the plastic samples used another way to increase the validity is to get wide range of the different types of plastics
2814,2,3,a the plastic type b has the greatest stretchability out of the other 3 types p b the student should be clear about the length of each plastic to ensure that only independent variable is the type of plastic also the student must determine the weight of the weights clamped on the plastic to keep one independent variable plastic type it is important to keep your constants constant
2815,2,2,based on the student's data it looks like they wanted to see if their type of plastic had an effect on how far it can stretch plastic type d must be hard plastic because for both trials one and two the plastic did not move 1 mm the students could have improved their results by telling us how much weight they used without the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so our results will be different also in step 1 the students did not say how long the plastic must be cut
2816,2,1,i conclude based on the data that out of the four different polymer plastics plastic type b was able to stretch the most mm 23mm other plastic type such as a only stretched 12mm plastic type c only stretched 13mm and plastic type b only stretched 20mm
2817,2,3,a based on the data i can conclude that plastic b had the most stretchability it stretched 22 and 23 mm c 14 and 13mm and d 20 20 mm were in between p b one way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything what plastic how long are they etc they could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two
2818,2,1,plastic type a seems to have been stretchy because it was stretched 2mm while b and c only stretched 1mm and type d is not stretchy because the number stayed at 20mm the student could have used something heavy doing with tape to hold it on the table in ease it came off and they could have also used something better than a clamp to stretch it
2819,2,2,a my conclusion is that based on the data plastic b has the most stretchability p b the student could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and if needed a fourth the student could also have repeated the process to find out why t1 data is different from t2 data
2820,2,3,plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22 23mm to improve this expierment the person doing the lab needs to know the weight of the weights along with the clamp that is serving as another weight
2821,2,3,in conclusion the polymer with the most stretchability is polymer b in t1 and t2 polymer b had the highest number of mm out of the other polymers there for it stretched the greatest amount in the future i think it would be helpful for the students to record how much weight they used to test each polymer i also think it would be beneficia to test more trials to be confident in the results
2822,2,2,a plastic type b is more stretchable than plastic type a c or d because in trial 1 plastic b stretched 22mm and it stretched 23mm in both trials plastic type b stretched farther than the rest a the student could improve the experimental design by being specific with what 4 polymers she was using the student could improve validity of her results by concluding even more trials than just 2
2823,2,2,a i concluded that plastic type b is the plastic with the best stretchability p b one way the students could have improved the experiment is by doing more than two trials for each type of plastic another way the experiment could be improved is by doing trials with different amount of weights
2824,2,0,in conclusion some would strech alot and same wouldn't they could improve it by adding more clamp or by streching it more
2825,2,2,a in both trials plastic type b stretched the most it stretched 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial one p one way the students could have improved their experiment is have all the plastics the same length another thing could they could have done to put on the weights till it repeat
2826,2,0,some of the students do like measuring but also like using the data table to find out the stretched amount is in the chart
2827,2,2,one of the many conclusions that can be drawn from this piece of data is that plastic d stretched the most and plastic a stretched the low two ways to improve this experiment is one to add more trials and two describe the amount of weighs being added to the clamp thus piece of info is crucial
2828,2,0,the two way the student could have improved the experimental design are why they put letters under plastic type is should be the type of plastic not a or b my second way to improved the exeperimental design is the amount stretched mm is wrong because what is t1 and t2 where is the t3 if their three type of plastic
2829,2,2,a plastic type b is the stretchable plastic than type a c and d p b two ways the student could have improved the experiment is to make sure that each piece of tape is the same length because it may affect the stretchability of the plastic another way to improve the experiment is to add the same amount of weight to each plastic type because it may affect the amount stretched
2830,2,1,plastic type b is the polymer with the most stretchability at the end of the experiment this is apparent because in both trials it stretched the most mm two ways to make the experiment better would be to leave the weights on for a longer period of time and also to add more weight on another was would be to make the experiment better would be to leave the heights on for a younger period of time and also to add more weight on another way would be to use a double thickness of each material in evert trials
2831,2,1,the conclusion that i draw based on the student's data is that plastic a streched the most two ways that the students could have improved their experimental design and or validity of their results would be to test all the materials at least three times and to and to allow the weights to hang longer than five minutes testing all materials three times improves the student validity because it becomes more accurate allowing wieghts to hang longer make it easier to see which material streches the most
2832,2,1,a after review of the results one can conclude that plastic type b as the most stretchable and durable this is because it had the highest mm stretch distance for both trials p b the student could have improved the results validity by performing 2 more trials after 2 minutes by giving the plastics time to recover he can either test the durability over time
2833,2,2,based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most with 22 and 23 where as plastic type a stretched 10 and 12 p one way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant another way thing could improve it is by making sure that when your letting it hang to stop it at exactly 5 minutes as you can keep the time constant too
2834,2,0,the students conclusion of this trial would be plastic type 4 produced 10mm of streching for t1 and t2 produced 12mm so it increased by 2mm type b produced 12mm of strechability for t1 and 23mm for t2 for an increase of 1mm type 3 produced 14mm of stretch ability for t1 and 13mm for t2 decreasing by 1mm and lastly type d produced 20 mm of stretchability for t1 and 20 mm for t2 that's what a students conclusion would look like
2835,2,1,2a based on the data its possible that he's hypothesis was right because the data seams close to each other so there's a higher possibility rigth than wrong p 3 the could have made more trials including a control varable one that doesn't change another way as by adding more weights but do the procedure a little bat different
2836,2,2,i have concluded that plastic b is the stretchiest and plastic a is the least stretchiest a validity issue could have been leaving the weights on to long another validity issue could have been the measuring of the plastics was off
2837,2,1,a plastic type b stretched the most after five minutes stretching 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2 the plastic type that stretched the least was type a it stretched 10mm in trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2 in conclusion the strongest polymer is type b p b the first way the student could improve on the experiment in a whole is tell what type of plastics were each he also could tell how much weight was added during the trials
2838,2,2,a the plastic type b could stretch the longest at 22 and 23mm also the plastic type d is the only plastic that had the same length of 20mm for both trials p b make a control having the clamp without weight be measured also they could've repeated the experiment by daily one more trial
2839,2,1,a based on the students data i can conclude that the amount each plastic type stretched at consistent rate during both trials p b the student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight was being added to the plastic samples they could've the validity of the experiment by trying different amounts of weight with each plastic sample
2840,2,2,a based on the results i can conclude that plastic b stretched the farthest in trials one and 2 it beat all others by at least a margin of two millimeters b one improvement they could've made is to any say length of each piece and make sure they were all equal another improvement could've been to tell us the type of plastic for re creature of the experiment
2841,2,2,a conclusion based on the data is plastic type b is the longest stretching plastic used two ways they could have improved their experimental design validity of their results by hanging the plastic sample in a different place and by cutting all the plastic samples the same length because that was not stated in the procedure
2842,2,1,i conclude that plastics a and c are a little stronger plastics than b and d because the both a and c stretched less than b and d p maybe 1 way to improve this is maybe wait a little longer until recording restarts because you might get a more interesting result another way to improve the validity of the answer to maybe test another time will get a third result making the answers more valid and presentable
2843,2,0,a a conclusion that could be drawn on their data is that on the plastic types c for t1 pool more than t2 and for plastic tyre d t1 and t2 had the same amount of stretched mm p b they could have tested their experement out longer and they could have used more interesting materials
2844,2,1,a plastic a b stretched down the same plastic c was not that stretched down at all b two ways the students could have improved their experiment would be to measure the plastic type before stretched down they should have had tested the plastic in different times for example t1 in 5 mins t2 in 10 mins trial 3 15mins etc until 30 mins
2845,2,1,plastic types b d are more stretchable than a c p they could do more trials and add more weights
2846,2,2,a based on the students data plastic type b stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability the one with the least stretchability was plastic type a b one way the validity of the results could have done more trials another way the test could have been improved is by stretching the plastics by hand untill they break
2847,2,1,if the students test out the four different plastic stretchability then add weights to the clamps on the bottom of the plastic and wait 5 minutes they will come to the conclution that plastic that plastic b is the most stretchable plastic b's results the first time was 22 the second time 23 the second most stretchable is plastic d which was 20 then 20 so in closing the students found if they put weights on the 4 different type of plastic and wait 5 minutes then repeat that plastic b is the most stretchable
2848,2,2,a based on the student's data i can concluded that the plastic type a stretched the least with 10mm and 12mm plastic type b stretched the most with 22mm and 23mm p b one way that the student could've improved the validity is to add more trials having at least 3 trials would have made this experiment more valid also adding more time intervals instead of just one for five minutes would have improved this experiment
2849,2,3,a based on the student's result it can be concluded that plastic b is the most stretchable because it stretched an average of 22 5 mm in 5 minutes plastic a is the least stretchable because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes on average p b 1 the student should have specified the amount of weight added to the clamp and possibly performed more trials at different weights 2 the student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results
2850,2,0,on for in coud wont up on bown 14 13 on c the investigation be not be what a and b be p a d in not good two d bon't go up or bown so c and d is not good for the investigation
2851,2,1,a my conclusion from this expiriment is that plastic type a is flexible b is somewhat flexible c as well and type d isn't flexible at all p b the students could improve by being more detailed in things like the weight of the clamp itself including a control of each plastic
2852,2,3,the conclustion of this lab according to the students data type b of the plastic is the weakest and type a of the plastic is the strongest for the plastic c and d they are inbetween and c is close to a the student could have improved the experiment by saying the measurement of the plastic and how much mass the was on earth peice of plastic another way to improve the experiment is making sure the temperature is kept constant and that no one touches the plastic
2853,2,3,the experiment was very precise and contained multiple trials that proved to be similar to the previous one plastic type b appears to have stretched the farthest but it is impossible to tell seeing there are no starting lengths the plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size
2854,2,2,a based on this students data i can come to a conclusion that plastic type b was the most streched p b two ways the student could have improved is by recording the length of the plastic before stretching also the student should have tested it three times instead of two
2855,2,0,the table characteristic property we formulate in the table because 10 12 22 and amount stretched mm t1 total is 44 and t2 600 the total att ch 9 clamp to the bottom plastic sample
2856,2,2,in this experiment i can conclude that plastic type b was the plastic that was capable stretching the most i can tell that plastic type a was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones students can improve the design by having a control so that they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable also in the procedure they should tell you how long the plastic should measure how long the length should be
2857,2,3,a plastic type polymer b had the best stretchability out of the other polymer plastics the data shows that in b s both trials it stretched 22 and 23 mm farthest than any other plastic p b two ways to improve the design are by doing more trials to be more accurate and by stating the amount of weight put on each bag the same amount of weight
2858,2,2,according to the data table plastic type b is the plastic that stretched the most without ripping one way that the student could improve is in the procedure when it says add weights she should tell how heavy should the weights be also she should tell what plastics were used
2859,2,3,a based on the data on the table i can conclude that plastic b was the stretchiest followed by plastic d c then a his results also seem precise because he did two trials and they were totally close to each other every time p b in the procedure the student should have made each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable they also should explained how much weight to put on the clamps as it was omitted in the procedure
2860,2,2,a based on the data plastic type ''b'' is able to stretch out the best compared to all other the differant plastic types p b one way the students could have improved the experiment would be increasing the amount of trials p another way to improve the experiment would be to increase the amount of minutes it's left hanging for example from 5 minutes to 10 minutes
2861,2,2,the conclusion can be made that the plastic type b has the greatest stretchability because in both trials is stretched the greatest number of mm in comparison to the other 3 plastic types the student should have conducted at least 1 more trial to validate the experiment since 3 trials are necessary for a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and constants would make the results more reliable
2862,2,2,a you can see the trails were accurate to eachother plastic b stretched the least with the average 11mm p b the student could have improved the expierement by including the ongional measure of the plastic they could have made the results more valid by keeping the weights on longer so there would be more variation between each result
2863,2,2,this investigation shows that plastic b stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment p one way the investigation could be to add more trials second if they added more time then maybe the outcome would have changed
2864,2,1,i can conclude that in trial 2 had a small impact on trial 1 the students could of improved adding the at same amount of weight to both type of plastics and keep that weights longer
2865,2,1,a plastic b c are almost similar but plastic d stretched the most p b two ways they can improve experiment was by adding a 3rd trial and also adding different times
2866,2,2,they could of improved it by putting their weight on them the same time and put the same amount of weight and had tried the object more than 2 times
2867,2,1,plastic type c stretched the most in both of its trials and plastic type a stretched the least in both of the trials the students could have allowed the plastics to long longer than 5 minutes incase it takes some plastics longer to stretch the students also could have used plastics that all had the same length to begin with to eliminate all chances of error
2868,2,2,plastic type a and b increased on the second trial while plastic type c decreased by 1mm and plastic type d stayed the same mm both trials p the students could have improved the design by conducting another trial to get accurate results the students could have been specific on the weight of the weights for example add 1 pound weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes
2869,2,0,the student could do better by describing it more how she did it and what she did add subtracting multiply divide or something
2870,2,1,a based off the information given plastic type b stretched the most the type d type c type a p b place more weight let it hang longer or less
2871,2,1,plastic d didn't change and plastic a stretched more in trial 2 basically most of the plastics change but not all of them p one way is making each plastic the same length before the experiment a second way is use the same amount of tape for each plastic type
2872,2,1,according to the student's data the plastic that streched the most was plastic type d and the one that streched the least was plastic type a p i think that this experiment could have been improved by instead of having a second trial you should have added more time
2873,2,2,from the data given to me i can draw the conclusion that plastic type a is the least stretchable of the plastics probably because of it's tight bonding plastic d on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers loose bonding one way the student could have improved his results could have been a 3rd trial that would improve the validity a second way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to ensure one self to have the same length plastic and time the experiment
2874,2,3,a plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic in t1 it stretched 22 mm and in t2 it stretched 23mm the least stretched plastic was type a in t1 a stretched 10mm and in t2 it stretched 12mm type d was second stretchiest and type c was behind d p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design validity of the experiment is having a specific size of the original piece of plastic to stretch and having a specific weight of the weight stretching the plastic constant keep the results of experiment valid
2875,2,1,one conclusion i made is that everytime in trial 2 it goes farther than in trial 1 the numbers increase two ways the student have improved on their experiment is by is by being more specific in their procedure and by adding a trial 3
2876,2,1,2 at the end of the experiment i have concluded that plastic b had the best stretchability because in 1 and 2 it reached 22 mm the first time and 23 mm the second time my hypothesis was also wrong because i had predicted plastic a would have the most stretchability but it didn't p b 1 put something heavier then weights 2 attach something other then a clamp
2877,2,1,a my conclusion based on the student's data is that t2 a b held a stronger than for t1 c for t1 was the one more mm than t2 but both trials seemed out for plastic type d p b two ways those students could have improved is if they kept the plastic the same size and shape and if they let hang for a min longer
2878,2,2,a out of all the plastic plastic a is the stretchiest based on the data it stretches 2 mm while the others stretched 1 mm or 0 mm p b to improve the experiment the student could have used plastics that were all the same length to begin with the student also should've verified the weight of the weights they used and made alls they used the same weight throughout
2879,2,2,a in conclusion plastic b had the most stretchability p b one way the student could have improved this experiment could be to start with the same length of plastic for each trial each plastic the second way i would change the experiment would be to use a stop watch be very presice about the time
2880,2,1,a the conclusion i have drawn about the students data table is that plastics a and b where stretchable while c actually decrease in size and d did not stretch at all p b two ways that the student could improve this experiment is by naming the different plastics so you know your not looking the same kind of plastic that then once also to add more trials because they only held two
2881,2,3,plastic type b was the most strechably polymer the student could have conducted more trails and tell us how much the weights weigh
2882,2,2,based on the student's data you can conclude that plastic a streched the most one way the student could have improved the experiment could be to have all of the plastics be the same size at the start of the experiment another way they could improve the experiment is to add a specific amount of weights in the clamp and have it be the same weight for each plastic
2883,2,2,a plastic type b is the stretchiest based on their data p b it could have be improved by using plastics of the same length he also could have taken different lengths of the same plastic
2884,2,2,plastic type a was the stretchiest the student could have improved the validity of the results by doing more trials in the investigation and by measuring the plastic prior to the experiment
2885,2,3,a plastic b has the most stretchability if you take the average of the two trials plastic b 22 5 mm is higher then plastic a 11mm plastic c 13 5mm and plastic d 10mm p b one way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving a specific amount of weight to add to each clamp another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity
2886,2,1,a my conclusion would be that the plastic type b would be better because it stretched more p b one way the could have improved there experiment design would have been leaving on e of the plastic bags with the weights the whole time control types of plastic bags
2887,2,1,two ways tat the student could have improved was to let the weights hang there for a little more time also use the same length of plastic for each trial
2888,2,2,a plastic type b is the one that has the most length p b the student could had put the plastic info equal pieces and add the same amount of weights to the bags
2889,2,3,a plastic type b stretched the most and plastic type a stretched the least p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to specify the starting length of the plastic samples and to specify the amount of weight added to each clamp
2890,2,2,a plastic type a is the most durable plastic because in trial 1 it only stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 12mm which was the least amount of stretching plastic type b is the most durable type of plastic because in trial 1 it stretched 22mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm which was the most amount of stretching the students could have improved their experimental design by stating how much weight they used for each trial because nobody knows how much weight they were using for each trial secondly instead of adding weight to the clamp the should have just put the weight onto the plastic itself to get maximum stretch
2891,2,2,plastic sample c seems to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted p 1 keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment p 2 determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp
2892,2,1,two ways they could've improved there expirament would be that they couldve let the weights hang on the plastic for a little but longer and that they shouldve used different types of bags the conclusion was that plastic type b stretched the most out of all the other bags
2893,2,0,maybe he use the clamp to attach it before he add in the agredienta
2894,2,2,based on the data one can conclude that polymer b is the stretchiest and polymer a is the least stretchy one way that the students could have improved the experiment is by repeating the test with different amounts of weight that way several stretchability of the bags could be tested also the students could have conducted more trials the more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident
2895,2,1,the conclusion is that in trials the student conducted it seems that in t2 the plastic stretched more than trial one the student could change the experiment by telling you how much weight she put on each clamp she could have taken away the second trial
2896,2,3,a my conclusion is that plastic b was the most stretchable plastic it stretched out between 22 23 mm in the two trials p b the student could have stated how many weights he she added he she also could have recorded the original lengths of each of the plastics he she was measuring
2897,2,2,in conclusion plastic type b stretched the farthest with a measurement of 22mm for thal 1and a measurement of 23mm for trial 2 p they could have done more trials or let the clamp hang on the different plastics for a longer amount of time
2898,2,2,a the conclusion is that one were smaller the another one large and in the end they both equal p b one way to improved is experimental design is if they change the weights another way to improve this experiment if they try more trail there going to be better
2899,2,1,a conclusion based on this experiment is plastic b was the most stretched to 22mm then on the second trial a stretched 23mm on the other hand plastic a c and d was lower than 22 and 23mm both times
2900,2,1,out of all the four plastics type b stretched the most one way the student could have improved was to mention that there are four types of plastics rather than are in step one another way the student could have improved was to make his her data table more clear and accurate by adding a time attached column
2901,2,2,a based on the data you can conclude that polymer b had the most stretchability because it stretched the most trial one 22mm and trial two 23mm p b to incate the validity of the experiment the student could have include the amount of weight that was added to the clamp this ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant the student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added
2902,2,2,a the average amount stretched for plastic type b was the most while the average amount stretched for plastic type a was the least p b the experiment could have been improved by both increasing the number of trials for every time the lab is conducted increasing the number of times the lab is conducted
2903,2,2,a in conclusion plastic type b is stretchier that the other plastics type b stretched the farthest thant the others in that 5 minute period p b the students could have let the plastics be stretched untill they broke to see which one was really the stretchiest and should have added the exact same weight for all the plastic types
2904,2,2,based on the data recieved plastic type c has streched the most compared to the other 3 plastic type c streched 22 mm for trial one and 23 mm for trial two in both trial one and two plastic type c stretched the most p one way they student can improve the validity of their results is by adding a third trial also you can measure each type of plastic to be the same exact size length and width by doing this it will make sure that the size of the plastic doesn't affect how much it streches
2905,2,3,a0 i conclude that plastic type b has the highest amount of stretchability plastic b is able to stretch from 22 to 23mm i can also conclude plastic a has the lowest stretchability at 10 to 12mm p b one way to make the investigation more valid is by having the length of each type of plastic be the same also the students need to make sure the plastic was taped the same way with the same tape the students also need to use the same table for all four plastics
2906,2,0,to improve this experiment the student should have mentioned the 4 different types of plastic if mentioned it would give a more accurate reason as why one type of plastic is more less stretchable than the other also what the different plastics are made off if we know that it may help us know why that plastic is or is not more stretchy from another type of plastic
2907,2,1,a the plastics stretch about the same amount in trial 1 and trial 2 but the 4 plastics amount of stretch differs greatly p b the students could have done another trial or change the experiment up a little bit
2908,2,2,plastic b is stretchiest p used a control and ran more than 2 trials
2909,2,2,a based on the students data trial 2 had a greater amount of stretch remained the same number of 30min in both trials b the student could have improved the experiment by adding 2 trial 3 to ensure accuracy another way the student could have improved the validity of the experiments was to record the amount of weights added to the clamp in step 4
2910,2,1,a based on the data both trials have the same stretchability p b the students could have stretched both plastics at the sametime also record how heavy the clamps are
2911,2,2,according to the student's data plastic type b was able to stretch the longest with 23mm type d was close with 20mm but types c and a were for less stretchy with 14mm and 12mm respectively the student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat the student should have also specified how much weight was added to the clamps for all i know he would have used random lengths and weights for each trial so he should have been clearer in the procedure
2912,2,3,based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most however the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results first off their should be a required standard length for each type of plastic the directions could be like step 1 cut a 2omm strip of each plastic also this experiment should specify the amount of weight placed on the clamp and this exact amount should be repeated throughout the rest of the experiment
2913,2,1,a from the table shown you can conclude that plastic type b in this investigation could stretch the farthest meaning it is the strongest of all the dffent types because it stretched 22mm and 23mm p b 1 could have said how much weight to start with each time putting diffent stress levels on the plastics 2 told how long to keep the weight on beforeadding on more because this could cause a change in strength or stretchability
2914,2,3,based on the students data i can conclude that plastic b stretches the most out of all the plastics p b two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by being specific about the length of each piece of plastic another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment
2915,2,0,a the plastic did in fact stretch only in to 23 mm p b the student could have used more weights on the second trial or maybe on the second trial let it beng longer
2916,2,2,based on the students data we could see that plastic type b was the polymer that stretched the most for both trials they had a longer length than all of the others of 22mm and23mm one way the student could have improved the experimental design could have been to note on the graph how long the polymer was before it was stretched
2917,2,1,the plastic type d is stretched the same amount in both trials one thing they could of improved on is they should have have 3 trials not just 2
2918,2,3,a based on the data shown in the experiment plastic b had the most stretchability and plastic a had the least stretchability p b they could have improved their experiment by 1 starting out with the amount of weight for each plastic and 2 they could have performed one more trial to make sure their results were correct
2919,2,1,if we streched 4 different types of plastics then the second plastic plastic d would strech the farthest p two ways the students could improve the experimental design and for validity of the results are naming the plastics to know which one is which so the data will not get mixed up also doing more than 2 trials another trial might helped the data
2920,2,0,well they improved by making the right design and following the right instructions
2921,2,1,based on the results shown plastic b has the highest stretchability after adding weight to the plastic for 5 minutes it showed that plastic b streched the most 22 and 23 mm next in high stretchability comes d c then a even though this experiment was good there are two ways to improve the experimental design i think they should have tested how different weights effected each type of plastic i also believe that there should be a controlled group one with no weight to compare the results of adding the weights
2922,2,3,a i think that the plastic type a was the strongest because it stretched down the least plastic type b was least strongest because it went down the most p b the student could included more trials to add validity the student could have also included how much weight was being added to the plastic
2923,2,2,you can came to a conclusion that plastic type b was the most stretchable for trial one it got 22mm and for trialz it got 25mm compared to the others that only got in the teens but 0 got 20mm both trials
2924,2,3,based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type a is the most durable p two ways the student could have improved this experiment would be to clearify how much weight was added to each plastic and to measure the plastic before he she stretched it
2925,2,2,a polymer b has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested p b the students can able more trials to their experiments also they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used
2926,2,2,a plastic type b was the stretchiest while a stretched the least p b 1 make sure the plastics were all the same length p 2 measure the plastics during the process of stretching
2927,2,2,plastic a b stayed stretched from the t1 and then streched more in t2 c went down so it probably gets shorter as you wear it out i guess d stayed the same p they should of added the amount of weight the attached to each plastic they should of said how much the clamp weighed
2928,2,3,a conclusion made from the students data is that different plastics' length are affected by wieght in their own ways staying the same growing or shortening the students could have been more specific by writing down how long each plastic has originally before the the 2 trials they also could have been more detailed about how much weight they were adding to the plastic
2929,2,1,a in conclusion plastic type b streched the most the data says it streched 22mm on trial one and 23mm on trial 2 p b one way the student could change the procedure is allow them to hang for 10 min instead of 5 minutes also they could change it up by changing the weights every time
2930,2,2,a based on the data shown on the table i would say that plastic type b has the most amount stretched p b the first way is would of presented the result better and have more trails second it says allow them to hang fro five mins it should ve been 10 15 mins 5mins does nothing
2931,2,1,a plastic a is stretched the bigest throughout the experiment while plastic d shoved no change b p the student could have improved the validity by adding more traits because the plastic would have stretched larger if there were more trials and also add constants because if more things are the same throughout the experiment then the results would be more valid
2932,2,1,according to the data provided this experiment had roughly the same outcomes in trial 1 and trial 2 it's either one number higher or lower in trial 2 but there're two ways that this experiment could be improved one explain what type of plastics are being stretched two say how much weight is going to be added to the clamps
2933,2,1,a plastic b stretched the most plastic a was the strongest out of all p b they should have added more weights to see which would have stretched the most and which would be stronger
2934,2,2,based on the result of the experiments we can conclude that plastic type b has the greatest elasticity of the four plastics one way the students could have improved on their experiments is to run a third test adding another test should show they would get result similar too the first two tests
2935,2,2,a concluding from the students data plastic type a is the strongest plastic c is the least strongest is the third and b is the least durable b the student could have improved this experiment is by doing at least one more trial they could have made a cooled and warmly the dependent independent variables to ran to this experimental design are vareid
2936,2,2,a in conclusion the plastic type b stretched the most in both trials it's the stretchiest p b the student could of stretched it by two students holding both sides and simply pulling with weights on it they could of repeated the procedure one more time they should of had a control grap
2937,2,2,a a conclusion that i have concluded from the data table is plastic type b and d were stretched the most leaving type a and c being the most durable types of plastic p b two ways that the students could have improved there experiment design or validity are more trials for more accuracy and more plastic types to experiment with to actually find out which one is the most durable
2938,2,1,a my conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type a is the one that stretches the most p b two things the student could of did to make his experiment better is one tell us how much the weights weighed and two tell us the plastic types of polymer be used
2939,2,2,i conclude that plastic type b would be the best plastic for stretchability because in both trials plastic b is the one that stretched the farthest in trial 1 it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it streached 23mm the student could have improved the validity by giving specific measurements for size of plastic so leure are all equal the student also could have sold to use the plastics when they were all the same day the agesa that are isn't older or weaver than another plastic
2940,2,2,a based on the students data a good conclusion to make is that plastic b was the strongest p b some ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be they should of said how much the weight weighed also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results
2941,2,1,a i conclude that plastic b has the highest tensile strength b they could have said how much weight to add as well as add a different amount of weight for the second trial preferrably a higher amount
2942,2,1,polymer a is a more hard and less maliable plastic which would been it would be like a 1 on 3 plastic d is really maliable and stretch so it would be a politer polymer they could improve on the design by may be using more weight so they get more stretch and see its limits and way it stretches because so polymers stretch in different directions they would do one more trial to get more data and make it more valid
2943,2,3,a based on the students date i can conclude that plastic type b is the most flexible at all the samples p b to improve their experimental design the students could have added more trials and also specified how much weight to add
2944,2,1,my conclusion is that plastic type a has the least stretchability and plastic type b has the most stretchability compared to both trials one way to have improved the experiment design would have been to add weights and let them hang foe ten minutes for the second trial and perform more trials with longer times with weights on the plastic
2945,2,2,the student could say how much weight he used also increase the weight in the second trial they should also perform the trial atleast 3 times to increase the validity of the results the students must also increase the time of hanging process
2946,2,3,the measures of every plastic should be the same to start secondly there should be a precise amount of weights being added my conclusion is that type b stretched the most it was easily the longest
2947,2,3,the student can conclude that polymer plastic b is the most strechability because it has the longest length in both trials two ways this experiment could have been better is by saying how much weight to add to each plastic polymer and second by repeting the experiment more than twice
2948,2,3,i conclude that plastic type b stretched the most one way the students could have improved the experiment design and or validity of the results is to make sure all the plastic types start out at the same length another way is to have a certain amount of weights for all the plastic type trials
2949,2,3,a no conclusion can be drawn from this experiment because the length of the plastic before the weights are added we not listed therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the farthest p b two was they can improve the valitity of this experiment are 1 list the length of the plastic before its stretched and 2 state how much the weight weigh and if they all the same
2950,2,3,a based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type b was the most stretchable this is because it was stretched more than the other plastic after 5 minutes in both trials for example plastic b stretched 22 mm in the first trial but plastic d the next most stretchable only stretched 20 mm the students could have improved the experiment adding more trials this would make their experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by they should have also tell how many weights to add at a time so that they and whoever else does this experiment remains constant
2951,2,2,based on the student's data the trials for each of the different plastics were very similar and showed no significant chang in how much the plastic stretched two ways to be more specific on exactly how much weight is to be added to the clamp also the student should include how big each plastic sample should be because if they used four different size samples the results would be inaccurate
2952,2,2,plastic type b stretas the furthet out of the other three what happens to plastic when i get low to the ground how much weight do they put to the end of these plastic
2953,2,2,a plastic type b has the most stretchability out of them all type d has the second most type c has the third mast and type a has the least p b one way the experiamental design could be improved is by saying how much the weights weigh also it would have been better if they averaged both trials together also
2954,2,3,2 plastic type b can stretch the most without bearing to the students could have conducted more trials which could have improved the experimental design and validity the students also should have specified the weights of each weights and the clamp so if someones were to repeat the experiment they would known how much weight to add
2955,2,1,a the percentage of the amount the plastic stretched was alot lower in the second trial than in the first p b they could have done more trials they could have used more polymer plastics
2956,2,1,plastic type b has the most stretchability after trials 1 and 2
2957,2,2,i drew a conclusion based on the students data that plastic type b stretched out the most in mm for both trial one and trial turn one way the students could have improved their experimental design is that they could've informed us what type of plastics were being tested like garbage bag freezer bag and sandwhich bag another way the students could've improved their experiments by how many weights did they put in for each plastic bag they stretched out
2958,2,1,based on the students data you can conclude that plastic b is more durable than the rest of the plastics tested also that plastic a was the least durable out of the plastics one way the students could improve their experiment is if they have at least 3 trials instead of just 2 another thing the group could do to improve their experiment is to identify the independent and dependent variables in their procedure
2959,2,2,a my conclusion to the polymet investigation is that plastic be is more likely to stretch the longest in five minutes p b they experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to show consistency or change in the experiment another way to give a hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong
2960,2,3,a based on the data given i can see that plastic a is the strongest polymer and doesn't have much stretchability p b to validate her results i think the student should have put how long the plastic was originally and how many millimeters long it was after the weights to see the actual data for ourselves the student could tested the plastic a third time to improve her experiment
2961,2,1,a to conclude polymer plastic b has the higest strech in meters p b add different weights p see which is more durable or stonger p clamp each differently
2962,2,3,a conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type b is the most flexible plastic and can stretch the farthest the student could have improved their experiment by stating how heavy the weights were that were attached to the clamp right now one can only guess what weight that was another way the student could have improved their experiment is by stating the original length of all the plastics cutting them all to a certain length would improve the validity of the experiment because it would show plastic b actually stretched the farthest and did not just showed off changes
2963,2,3,from the data given i conclude that plastic b had the most strech ability and plastic a had the least two ways this experiments could be improved is by using the same size plastic for each type of plastic and by stating how many he used
2964,2,1,a two out of the four plastic types lengths increased p b first the students should have more trials and allow the weights to hang more than five minutes on to the clamp
2965,2,2,in each trial both 1 and 2 the amount stretched increased steadily and ended at the same amount two ways the student's could have improved there experiment was by saying how much weight to put on the clamps another way to improve the experiment was to say how far would they have wanted the weight and clamps to be far down or far up
2966,2,3,a plastic sample b was the stretchiest because it's greatest length was 23mm p b they should have measured the length of the plastic before they stretched it so we can know how much it stretched they also should have run more than two trials so we can be absolutely sure of their results
2967,2,3,a based on only the data shown one can conclude that plastic the most stretchability out of all the plastic tested because it stretched the most during the experiment one can also assume that plastic type a has the least stretchability because it stretched the least during the experiment one way that the experimental design could have been improved is to have controlled the original lengths of all the plastics and make them equal another way to have improved the experimental design is to have included the exact weight that was being applied to the plastic
2968,2,0,a some plastics are more strichy or maybe some of them are harder than the other brands p b they could of put the time period a little longer also for t2 they could of put more weight than t1
2969,2,3,a in conclusion plastic type b has stretched the most probably not the most dependable material the best plastic type would be a plastic type a can withstand the most support of weight in the bag so you don't have to worry about it ripping p b these students should have conducted a third trial it would have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags
2970,2,1,the conclusion that i have drawn is that plastic type d streached the most which makes it more durable than the rest two ways he could have improved was by telling us how much weught was added and by telling us he averaged out the three plastic samples strechness
2971,2,1,a the total amount of t2 is greater than t1 p b all lengths should be the same and every step should be equal to the others
2972,2,0,from the students data from conclude that type d is most stretch able and that type a is the least stretchable this lab couldn't been improved by saying to record the measurements in steps 7 5 also by taking what until to measure with in steps 7 5
2973,2,1,the number incress for t2 most of the time p do another trial
2974,2,3,a from the table results for the experiment you can conclude that type b was the most stretchable out plastic and type a was the strongest at holding together the polymers and cross linking made it strong p b she could have improved the experiment by allow more trials and making sure the plastic samples were the same size and length
2975,2,2,a the polymer plastic withe biggest stretchability was type b because it stretched over 22mm b the students should have measured the amount of mm the plastic stretch while the clamps were still on also the students should have used plastics of all the same length
2976,2,2,a in conclusion different polymer plastics do have different stretchabilities some polymers such as b and d are much more stretchable than polymers such as a and c p b the student could have improved this experiment by specifying the amount of weight used and how far to let them hang also the student should have specified how to calculate the amount of polymer stretched
2977,2,2,a in conclusion plastic type b in trial 1 and trial 2 stretched more then plactic type a c and d p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are they could of tested more times to get better results and they could of let the weights stay in the bag a bit longer before removing them
2978,2,2,it has been confirmed accordind to the data in the table that plastic type b can be streched out the longest compared to plastic types a c and d plastic type b reached length of 23mm which is the highest length measure in the table two ways the student can improve there design or validity of their results is by collecting more data and creating more trials to get a more accurate result
2979,2,2,based on the student's data plastic type d stretched the most for both trials so that would be the one to choose when looking for the most stretchable the first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial the second way the student could have improved the experimental design is by making sure all the clamps and weights are the same and are hanging for exactly the same amount of time
2980,2,3,a when stretched plastic b seemed to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic a seemed strongest p one way is to have equal size plastics to start with another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to be added to each
2981,2,3,the conclusion that can be drawn from the data done in that plastic type b stretched the most which was 21mm in t1 and 22mm in t2 one way the student could've improved the experiment is to add another trial also by using the same weight to weights
2982,2,2,a based on the student's data plastic type b was more flexible and susceptible to stretching plastic type a was most likely a harder or thicker type of plastic making it more difficult to stretch p b to improve the experiment and validity of the results the students could have run more than two trials so they had more to compare they also could have included record results in their procedure
2983,2,2,my conclusion will be that with the added weight the plastics stretched p to make this trial more reliable the student should have stated how long and wide each plastic should be the students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic
2984,2,3,a based on the student's data plastic b is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic a is the least stretchable p b one way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way
2985,2,2,the student's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by writing its first starting length and for another improvement they could have one a third trial to rest if their experiment is true
2986,2,3,the plastic that the most stretchability is plastic b probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other and it stretched an average of 22 23mm 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial and using the same length for each sheet or plastic
2987,2,2,a plastic type d was able to stretch farther so based on that result i conclude it was able to withstand more weight p b two ways the student could of improved the validity of the result are use the same size of plastic for all trials and types and add another trial to combine results
2988,2,1,50 of the plastics stretched farther the second time 25 did worse the second time and a 5 did the same p a third trial might help and explain what the if plastics were
2989,2,3,plastic type b has the most stretchability one way that this could have improved is if the students did another trial to make sure that their experiment was valid another thing the students want to do is make sure they have the same size of plastic to start with
2990,2,2,is conclusion plastic b stretched the most and plastic a stretched less p the student could've retested a 3rd time and state wat he was trying the acomplizb
2991,2,3,a in this experiment the plastic b stretched the most because it went 23mm and a went 12mm and 13mm and d 20mm b they could have improved there experiment by doing more trials and have the plastics of the same lenghth
2992,2,2,a a conclusion would be that plastic type a could withstand the most weights with out being stretched the most p the first thing they could do to improve their experiment would be to use a specific of weights and clamps the second thing would be to increase the number of trials
2993,2,0,based on the data collected from the experiment you can conclude that plastic type d stretched the most validity the students did two trials and their results from the second tool were very similar to the first trial one way the student could of improved the experiment is adding more weight to see if they could of stretched further another way to improve the experiment is by using more then one type of plastic
2994,2,1,a plastic d and plastic c are not that good the two types that increased type a and b p b they should'nt have taped it to a table there should have been 2 people holding it from both sides also i think they should have measured in inches
2995,2,1,type a plastic stretched the most p attach the plastic to the side of the table in a more effective way and provide the names of the plastics rather than giving them variables
2996,2,2,a conclusion i can draw from the data is that plastic type a had stretched more in t2 than the rest the others were only one mm apart while plastic type a had a difference of 2mm one way the students can improve their experiment is by having the plastic the same length in the beginning and the second way is by adding how many weights it took so the plastic would stretch
2997,2,3,in conclusion plastic type b stretched the most in both trials p one way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp
2998,2,2,i would conclude that the plactic t2 to more strechy than t1 it could be improved quite a few way frist off it was never stated how much wight is being added or if it was the same each time or the fact that
2999,2,2,a the most stretchable polymer was polymer d where it stretched 20 mm both trials also making it the most reliable as it's stretchability didn't fluctuate p b one way they could've improved the experiment is by specifying what the weight of the weights added to the clamp were and how many to ensure that all polymers were tested the exact same way second they could have a third or even fourth trial to their experiment to increase validity of the experiment
3000,2,0,the conclusion would be that the plastic in trial2 was stretchies for the most part trial 1 two ways they could have improved this experiment would be to repeat the procedure with different plastic and put it at different temperatures
3001,2,3,plastic type a stretched the least out of all 4 plastics leading to a conclution that it has the worst stretchability of all 4 plastics plastic type b stretched the most for both trail test 1 2 enough info to conclude that b has the best stretchability p the students could of improved their experiment by adding in the procedure exactly what was the weight of the weights they used and they could of performed a 3rd trail test to see if results were continues and never changing
3002,2,3,in this experiment students tested to see
3003,2,1,a according to the data shown plastic type d has the most stretchability p b the student could have done more trials made a line graph and tested the plastics for different times
3004,2,1,based on the students data the amount that has been stretched finally didn't make a difference because som when up by 1 and 2 and some just shod the same one way the student could have improved their experiment design is telling us how many weights to add to the clamps
3005,2,1,after reading the data i have concluded that plastic type b is the stretches one out of four types i concluded that type b is the best because when you add up the numbers from t1 t2 for each number type b has 45mm so it is the longest on
3006,2,1,a the plastic that stretched the greatest has the plastic type b almost more than half the plastic types had stretched more the second trial p b this student should label the names of the plastic not just a d
3007,2,3,the conclusion that can be drawn based on their data is that that plastic type a was the least stretchable and is the most durable and plastic type b is the most strechable and the least durable one way they could've improved their experiment is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piece because that could affect the stretchability of each plastic another improvement could be that they could've specified how much plastic should be hanging from the table so each plastic has same amount of length
3008,2,3,a in conclusion plastic b was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while a 10 c 14 d 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while a 12 c 13 d 20 p one way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials the second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging
3009,2,2,a in conclusion my hypothesis was right the plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that the weight was hanging on it the independent variable was the plastic and the dependent variable was the weight p b the students could have improved the experimental design by having the weight the same for every trial also there should have been more than two trials
3010,2,1,i conclude that plastic type d was able to stretch themost out of all of the plastics the two things these students would have done to improve ther validity and experimental design is they could have used more trials and they also could have used a control
3011,2,0,plastic type a was the strongest the student could have made it before and after instead of trial 1 and trial 2 they also could have named the different type of plastics
3012,2,1,a conclusion that can be drawn from the students' polymer investigation would be that plastic type a was the strongest plastic used it took the least amount of stretches although it had gained two stretches on the second trial two ways the students could have improved their experiment are that they could have increase the amount of plastic types and include more trials of testing the different plastics
3013,2,3,the data provided concludes that plastic type b stretched the most one way the student could improve the validity of this experiment would be to state the weight of the weights that are to be added onto the pieces of plastic one thing the student also should have done was to have recorded the original lengths of the plastic samples so you could see just how much the pieces of plastic streched from their original lengths
3014,2,2,in conclusion the students data table is base on that plastic type b in both trail had most streched the students could have improve more if they add other trail and added on control
3015,2,0,for one the student could of use two wheights instead of one and also use a diferent method for example instead of hanging the bowls from the table hang them up from a high place
3016,2,1,plastic d has no stretchability it stayed the same both trial kinds p the students could of improved there experiment by putting a time for trial 2 also giving an exact amount of weight that should be added to the plastic
3017,2,3,based on the students data plastic type b has the highest stretchability at 45mm stretched while plastic type a would be the worst at only 22mm stretched p two ways the students could have improved their data are one they could say how heavy the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes two they could have had more than 2 trials
3018,2,2,based on the student's data i can tell that plastic type b was the most stretchable i see this because in his results plastic b had the greatest amount in milimeters stretched two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results was by giving the initial length of the plastics and each plastic should have had a constant length
3019,2,0,conclusion the tape has stretched more because of the weight level has a high level of density to improve they should make a bar graph
3020,2,1,a a conclusion based on the student's data that i can draw is the plastic all stayed around the same amount stretched from t1 to t2 if any thing it was 1mm or 2mm of the first ti p b two way the students could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results was to do more than one way to stretch the bags and to do 3 trails each
3021,2,0,to conclude plastic type b stretched more in trial 2 it stretched 23mm the plastic that least stretched was plastic type a it only stretched 12mm for trial 2 and 10mm for trial 1 this means plastic b is the strongest and plastic a is the weakest also plastic d stayed constant for trial 1 and 2
3022,2,3,a conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type b is the most amount stretched and plastic type a was the least amount stretched two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take also the amount of weights you add one
3023,2,2,in conclusion to the student's expirements each plastic had stretched more or less the same amount of the first trial plastic b was the most stretchable an improvement the students should have made was make each piece of plastic the same length before stretching the students could have improved the validity by showing the length of the plastic before it was stretched to measure exactly which plastic stretched more
3024,2,0,the two ways the student could have improved experimental design out or validity of the results are procedure 4 add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes if you do that you doing to know plastics is stronge and can carry a havy thing 5 remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types after you remove the weights and cound how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic
3025,2,1,a conclusion drawn is that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial the students could have included a diagram to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials so the students should have done another trial and drawn a diagram
3026,2,3,based on the student's data plastic type b was consistently the stretchiest of all the plastic types used in the experiment one possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial the procedure does not tell in how much weight must be applied and thus a person may apply uneven amounts of weight dipending on the trial and plastic this would cause the experiment to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that the weight was not constant also the student could have improved the experimental design by adding more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more accurate
3027,2,3,according to the data table it looks like the plastic type b was stretched the most and plastic a was stretched the best b one way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic
3028,2,1,based on the data shown plastic type 'd' seems to be the most durable the table shows that it did not stretch the student could have improved validity by doing more trials and repeating the experiment more than once incase any error wes made during the first run through of the test
3029,2,1,the students could have improved their design results by measuring the weight of the clamp without the weights attached and they could have done a third trial
3030,2,2,a the conclusion is that plastic type a streched the least 11mm compared to the other plastics plastic type b stretches the most 22 5 p b two ways that the student could have improved his experiment was to do at least three trials to get a more accurate results another way could have been streching the plastics for more than five minutes to make the results more accurate
3031,2,1,a the data from this investigation shows that the plastic stretched the furthest was type b next was type d then type c and finally type a the information shows they did two trails to make sure they have correct information p b one way the student could have improved this experiment design was to make steps and to explain the procedure more next i would say to make a graph would be the best way to further improve these results
3032,2,2,a conclusion based on the student's data would be that plasic d has the most stretchability one way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant for example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to for instance one plastic with no weight
3033,2,2,i think that plastic type b is the best because it stretched the farthest in both trials p they should've been more specific with whic four types of plastics they should have used and they should have said exactly how many weights to put on it
3034,2,3,b the student should use all sample plastics of the same length so the strength and stretchability can be determined the student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error p a from the experiment plastic type b came to be the most stretchable plastic type d was also very stretchable and the second stretchiest plastic type c came after b and after c came plastic type a plastic a was the strongest but plastic b was the stretchiest
3035,2,1,a in conclusion based on the students data t1's plastics where a little bit weaker the t2's p b one way a student could have im proved the experiment is by adding more length to the plastics p another way to improve the experiment is by trying more trials
3036,2,3,based on the student's data plastic b stretched the most with 22 and 23 mm in their trials respectively however the student cold've recorded the starting length and the difference in length as from this data the reader doesn't know if these results are comparative in the procedure the first step is measuring the length but i don't see that data another improvement wold be more trials
3037,2,3,a the students conclusion is that although plastic d was the most accurate plastic b stretched the most for both trials p b the procedure does not say the amount what unit of weight was added the plastics also must all be the same length
3038,2,3,one conclusion that can be based off the student's data is that plastic type b has the most stretchability out of all of the plastics tested one way this student can improve the experimental design is to add more trials to the experiment another way is to set the length the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error
3039,2,2,in conclusion plastic b stretched the most 22 23 mm and plastic a stretched the least 10 12 mm p one way to help improve the experiment is to have a constant which would be each plastic with out any weights another way to help improve this experiment is to specify how much weight should be added to the clamp
3040,2,3,a based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most on the first trial plastic type b stretched 22mm while plastic c only stretched 14mm on the second trial plastic b stretched 23mm and the next closes was plastic type d which stretched 20mm p b two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to do more trials and when the students are starting the experiment tell me how long the plastic is before you start to stretch it
3041,2,0,plastic type a stretched 2in and plastic type d it didn't stretched at all
3042,2,0,the conclusion i have come to base off of the students data is that the most durable plastic strength base is 1 i know this to be true because there is no length difference between t1 t2
3043,2,2,plastic type a stretch 10 mm on the first trial and 12 on the second type b stretched 22 mm on the first and 23 on the second type c stretched 14 mm on the first trial and 13 on the second type d stretched 20 mm on the first trial and the same amount on the second i can conclude that type b has the most stretchability because it stretched 22 mm on the first trail and 23 mm on the second trail two way to improve is to add a trail and try different amounts of weights
3044,2,2,a conclusion for this lab could be that plastic type b stretched the most because it is thin and that type a streched the least because it is the thickest a way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics also to say how much weight to the clamp
3045,2,1,based on the student's data i can conclude that plastic type d is the strongest of them all for both trials 1 and 2 i think they could have explained it more so that i could have a better mental image of it i also think they should have said how much weight they added the the clamps
3046,2,2,a based on the students data you can tell the plastic did not stretch too much most of the plastics ended up stretching 1 2 mm for example plastic a went from stretching at 10mm 12mm on the other hand plastic c decreased 1mm and went from 14mm 13mm plastic d didn't stretch within both trials p to improve their experiment the student could have recorded how long the bag was before weights were placed on them and they could have also said how much did the wights have to weigh in order to keep how much the bag stretched constant
3047,2,0,the conclusion i get on this students data is that all the plastics have been weighed and been measured but as they did the 2trial the data changed and for plastic type d its weight and length was the same it means that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same
3048,2,3,a the conclusion that i could base is that plastic type b in both trials had stretched the longest p b two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design is by letting us know how many weights put in each cup also the same length of each piece should be noted as well
3049,2,1,a my conclusion on the student data table is that plastic d was the strongest it stretch up to 20 mm in both trials p b two ways the student could have improve was to make a 3 trial or test and to be able to measure the abravasion of the plastic types
3050,2,1,after experimenting which plastic was more pliant the conclusion was made that plastic type b was the most stretchable in both trial a and trial b two ways the student could have improved the experiment are changing step 7 and making it less vague and say specifically re do steps 1 6 for a second trial etc the student could be sure to time each trial for accurate validity
3051,2,2,the plastic type b has the most elasticity over all the other plastics plastic type a has the least amount of stretchability over the plastics a way he could've improved this experiment is by overaging out both times he measured the elasticity another way he could've improval this is by trying out more times and then averaging those out
3052,2,2,it can be concluded that plastic b is the stretchiest because it had the highest average and much stretched of 22 5 mm two ways the students would have improved their experimental design are that they should've included how much weight the weight was and how many clamps to use also they should've used a control plastic to compare their results to
3053,2,2,one conclusion i ran make is plastic b was best of stretchability and students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size another way is they could have added another column to show at what sise the plastic was before the expiriment so that you can see how much the plastic stretched
3054,2,3,a polymer plastic b had the most stretchability of 23mm 11mm more than plastic type a 10mm more than plastic type c 3mm more than the stretchability of plastic type d by having more improved trials they should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width and they could have tested more types of plastics
3055,2,3,a based on the student's data you can conclude that plastic type b is the most stretchable and plastic type a has the least stretchability p b one way the student could improve is by making sure the plastic strips are all the same length hanging off the table from the same point another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip this would provide a constant to compare the results to
3056,2,1,this experiment didn't seem to work out very well judging by the data table the experiment didn't seem to prove anything there are no significant changes in the lengths of the plastics the first three steps of the experiment are good but rather than removing the weights the student should just keep adding more and more weights until the plastic finally stops that would really show how much the plastic could stretch another way to improve the experiment is to conduct a third trial an experiment is more valid when there are more and more trials
3057,2,1,a plastic type 2 had more stretchability then all the other plastics tested p b the student could have improved the test by saying how much weights was added during the experiment the student could have also discribed the rate at which to add the weights for consistancy
3058,2,2,i have concluded that plastic b stretched the most it stretche about 23mm in all p name what plastics they were measure the plastic before you stretch it
3059,2,3,according to the data plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic it stretched 22mm in trial one and 23 mm in trial 2 p one way the students could have improved the validity of the experiment would be to not just add weights to the plastic like in the procedure but put the same amount of weight on the plastic each time another problem would be if the plastic wasn't taped at the same distance from the edge and if they are using a new set of the same plastic for their second trial
3060,2,1,two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to added different weights to see how much long the plastic could stretch until it trips another is to do more than two trial to make more reliable
3061,2,2,a plastic type b has the greatest stretchability amoung the four types of plastic in the first trial it stretched 20mm and in the second trial it stretched 23mm plastic type a has the worst stretchability in t1 it stretched 10mm and in t2 it stretched 12mm p b adding many more trials and by adding more weight to the clamp so that the plastic could stretch until it tears
3062,2,3,a based on the students data plastic type b was the most stretchable of the tested plastic p b one improvement would be keeping the starting length them same stating it second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals
3063,2,2,based on the student's data it can be concluded that plastic type b has the best elasticity the student could have improven the experiment by adding trials and specifying in the procedure how much weight is used
3064,2,2,plastic type b has stretched the most and a the least d has stayed the same for both trials while c has stretched less n during the second trial and a and b have stretched more two ways in which the experiment could be improved is to tell how much weight to add and tell what types of plastics were used in the results
3065,2,0,my conclusion based on the student data is that plastic typ d stretched the most and plastic type a stretched the least
3066,2,3,plastic type be was the most stretchable stretching on average of 22 5mm and plastic type a was the least stretchable stretching an average of 11mm the students could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight they attatched to each plastic and then keeping it constant the way the procedure is written now we don't know if the amount of weight was used constant
3067,2,1,i can conclude that plastic c is the weakest out of all the plastics because it stretched the most one way that the students could have improved the experiment is to do more than two trials in each plastic because two trials is not reliable enough also the students should have checked the length of the plastic at different time intervals like every minute so you could see how the plastic stretched over time
3068,2,1,plastic type a is the strongest type and has the strongest polymers two ways in which the experiment could have been better is that the student could have added the weight of the clamps to this data and the student could have also added the table height
3069,2,3,a i conclude that plastic a is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials p b two ways the student could have improved the experiment are doing another trial and including the length of the plastic rerare adding the weights in the results
3070,2,2,wsr
3071,2,2,type d stretched the same length in test one and two they could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were
3072,2,1,it can be concluded that samples b and d had higher stretchability than samples a and c to improve the experiment design the students could have clarified how many weights they were adding to the clamp because that should have remained constant could for accurate results also the student could have made it clear exactly where on the table the samples were being taped because for example if one was an inch onto the table that would take an inch off the final results
3073,2,2,a plastic type b had stretched more than plastic type a in trials 1 and 2 in trial 1 plastic type b stretched 22mm and in trial 2 it stretched 1 mm more p b the student could have put the temperature in the experiment because that could've been a cause of the amount stretched of plastic the student could've as put the start of how much the plastic weighted in mm
3074,2,2,in this experiment students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability in conclusion types a b stretched at least one or two mm from its original length yet type c shrink and type d remained the same one way the students could of improved their experiment is by adding how big or heavy the weights they used to stretch experiment is listing where they wanted the top of the plastic taped to the desk
3075,2,2,based on these results plastic type b and d stretch the most but of the four plastics while plastics a and c sustain their shape much better the student could have improved the design of this expiriment by setting on exact weight being added to the plastics and by completing one more trial to make a total of three trials
3076,2,3,a plastic b was the one with the most stretchability plastic d came next followed by plastic c then a p b the student could have included how much the weights weighed this would make the experiment valid when reproduced p also they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched
3077,2,3,based on the student's data i can conclude that plastic b is more flexible this is because for each trial it stretched the most on the other hand plastic a stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm and 12 mm while b stretched 22mm and 23mm p to improve the validity of the results the student could have done a third or even fourth trial this adittional data will make the results clearer also the student should state how much the weights weigh so that others can preform his experiment and get similar results he might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally
3078,2,2,a based on the students data you can conclude that plastic type b has the most stretchability p b one thing the student could have done top improve their experimental design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamps they also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left right or anything
3079,2,1,one conclusion it can draw based on the student's data is that plastic type b is stretched much more mm than the other three types maintining the amount of 20 mm in both trials based on the data plastic type a is less flexible stretch 10mm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial the student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch
3080,2,2,a conclusion to data is that plastic type b is able to stretch the furthest out of the rest of the plastic types the student could have improved the design by adding another trial to all plastic types also by altering the plastic to hang longer
3081,2,3,according to the graph plastic type b was the plastic that was stretched when plastic that was stretched when plastic type a did not stretch as much clearly type a is more durable and sturdy to improve the experimental design the students should have said what each of the starting weights put on the plastic were and do a third trial to make it as accurate as possible
3082,2,2,my conclusion would be that after only two trials plastic type b proved to be the most stretchible of those 4 plastics one way they could have improved was to do another trial another way is instead of only allowing five minutes they should of let hang untill it was about to rip in then measure giving it maximum legnth
3083,2,2,a a conclusion from this data is that plastic sample b is the the most stretchable p b two ways that the student could have improved the validity of the results are making the plastic samples the same initial size and allowing the plastic samples to stretch for more than five minutes
3084,2,1,a from the students results i see that plastic b was the strongest stretching 23 mm plastic d was next stretching 20 mm plastic c was third stretching 14 mm lastly plastic a was the weakest stretching 12 mm p b two ways the students can improve their experiment is to do more trials for better results also they could increase the height of the table to avoid the results be tampered should the plastic stretch to the floor
3085,2,2,it can be concluded that plastic a is the strongest and most durable plastic it stretched significantly less then most other plastics with an average of 11mm plastic c would be the second best because it stretched an average of 13 5mm followed by plastic d with 20mm stretched and lastly plastic b with 2205mm stretched the student could improve this experiment by adding a control and could be more valid by making sure each plastic was the same length
3086,2,1,the plastic from t2 stretched a little more than it did in t1 they could have made sure the plastic weights the same and the could of made sure the weights were all equal in each group
3087,2,3,a in conclusion to the results it can be said that polymer b is the most stretchy followed by d then c then a the only problems is that you can't accurately judge it because you can't tell if they are all the same beginning length a conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length p b one way to improve the design would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer
3088,2,0,it seems that plastic a is the most strechable because it is the only one that stretched longer two ways that the students could improve the experiment is to name the different plastics also add heavier weights
3089,2,3,it can be recorded that above all others tested in the experiment plastic type b is the most stretchable this is because at 22 5mm it had the largest amount stretched on average between the two trails or all other plastic types p two ways this experiment can be improved is to state the amount of weight used foeach trial with different weights being used results could have different from what they should have been also because the amount stretched is measured in such small increments millimeters more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy
3090,2,3,a i conclusion all of the plastic stretched but plastic type b stretched the most in bath trials p b two ways the students could have improved their experiment design and or validity of the results are they could have told how much weight to add to the plastics they could have told the plastic pieces original length those are two ways the students could have improved their experiment
3091,2,0,a overall in this experiment trial 2 had stretched more than trial 7 p b try adding more weight to the plastic bags and let the weights hung on the bags for a longer period of time
3092,2,2,a the conclusion is that all of the plastics stretched from 10 mm 23 mm plastic type a stretched the least and plastic type b type b stretched the most p b the students could did a third trial or make a fourth trial they could added the temp and weights to the plastic types of the same time and then measured at the same time
3093,2,3,a the stretchiest of the four materials was b with the average stretchincs of 22 5mm's p b the student could have made sure to cut all the plastic into even strips of the same length and width and second they could have performed another trial for each plastic
3094,2,2,a you could tell that plastic type b would be the best plastic because it stretched the most with weights onit p b two ways the students could have improved were said how much the weights weighed also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights
3095,2,0,a conclusion based on the student's data would be that the plastics were other a little more or less stretchy the second time due to it being stretched out the first time one way the student could have improved the experiment design was by performing a third trial without weights another way would be to allow them to hand for about 10 minutes the 3rd time
3096,2,0,they can conclude that even after a second trial of stretching the plastics significantly didn't stretch to much larger than trial 1
3097,2,2,3 in conclusion plastic type b stretched the most because during 11 it stretched 22mm and during 12 it stretched the least p the student could have improved the experiment design by adding more ways to stretch the plastic for example adding little heat the results could have simply been improved with a few more trials
3098,2,2,based on the students data it can conclude that plastic type d is the plastic with the most stretchability two ways this experiment could have been improved is by adding more trials also adding the amount of weights and being specific about the length of each plastic
3099,2,2,3 a plastic type b had stretched the most out of both of the trials p b added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging
3100,2,2,one conclusion that i can draw from this experiment is that plastic b stretched the most for both trials 2 ways to improve the validity would to be add a control no weight and see if it stretches and the size of the plastic sample just to make sure that every plastic is the same size to start
3101,2,3,a a conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type b has the most stretchability this is because in both trials it stretched 22 23 mm and that is more than any other plastic type tested p b two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length afall the plastic types be the same and constant making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
3102,2,2,plastic type a 10 mm t1 t2 12 p b 22 mm t1 t223 c 14 mm t1 t2 13 p d 20 mm t1 t220 p 2 ways the student could have improved p 1 repeat the whole procedure 3 times p 2 measure 3 times the sample of one type of plastic and measure length
3103,2,0,i think e 11 12 40 40
3104,2,2,a conclusion based on the data given is that each piece of plastic stretched around the same amount each trial this lets you know that it his as really the only amount it can given one it wasn't really change her multiple trays two ways the student could have improved the validity is by making each amount of plastic the same and by using the same amount or weight for each trial
3105,2,1,in conclusion if the student was to go on with the investigation t2 will allways have depending on the plastic 12 23 13 20 up the numbers p two ways the students could have improved the experimtal are 1 the could of told us how much weights to and 2 if they hang the clamp for 10min the experiment might have change
3106,2,3,a i concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials i also noticed that the most stretchable was b and the least was a p b though two trials is good it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best also i think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics
3107,2,2,based on the student's data c is wrong because the first time is streched 14mm then the second time is stretched 13 how is that possible the second trial should be more or equal if the used the same weight p b he could told us how much weight he used also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right
3108,2,1,based on the students data i can say that plastic type c can stretch the most because in both trials plastic type c stretched atleast 9mm longer than the second hoghest plastic stretchability to improve the experimental design the students could have said how much weight should be attached to the clamp and exactly what steps should be repeated in the second trial
3109,2,0,based on this students information i would say that the first 2 exceeded because they went up the second time this means it went farther but for the last too the went down or stayed the same a way the student could have improved was to make step 6 in the procedure more clear by saying what steps to repeat second way they could improved was by for step five put more steps because step 5 has like 3 steps in one
3110,2,1,the student's results show that plastic b was the most elastic plastic d was second plastic c was third and plastic a was fourth in terms of stretchability plastic b is the most and a is the least p two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity is by doing more trials with different amounts of weight to really understand how stretchy the plastic is another way it could be changed is by changing the times of the trials to see how long it took each plastic to let the plastic get to the maximum length
3111,2,1,according to the data table the conclusion of this experiment would be that plastic type b stretched the most in both trials 1 and trials 2 p two ways the students could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to try different amounts of weights that get attached to each plastic and also to let the plastic hang for different amounts of time to see the affect it would have
3112,2,1,a plastic type a has the most stretchability than the other plastic types p b the students could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results if they had more trials and a better control
3113,2,2,a form the data table it can conclude that plastic a was the most durable when stretched and the least durable was plastic b plastic a stretched 10mm than 12mm while plastic b stretched 22mm than 23mm p b 1 there is no indication that after the first trial he replaced the plastic which of made the results from trial b invalid 2 he could have done the lab again or added a trial 3 and 4 the more you do the later the better off your results will be it would make it more valid 3 he could have also tried the plastics because if me great longer from another it would stretching
3114,2,2,a i conclude that plastic type a stretched the most 2ml p b to improve the experimental design and or mostly of the results species the amount of weight added to the clamp and make all pieces of places for one uniform length
3115,2,3,i have come to the conclusion that plastic type b has the best stretching ability since the data shows it stretched 22 mm and 23 mm the students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same also the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials
3116,2,3,in conclusion it can be said that plastic type b had the most amount stretched because its numbers in t1 22 and t2 23 were the highest also the plastic type that was more durable and was not stretched is muuh was plastic type a because its number in t1 10 was and t2 12 were the lowest to improve this experiment it would be better to include three trials and include the plastics type initial measurements to make the data table more specific and efficient
3117,2,2,based on the data table plastic type b stretched the most in the 15 minutes with the amount stretched for t 1 was 22mm and for t2 23mm so type b had the most stretchability p 2 ways the students could have improved their experiment would be labeling the type of plastic they were using instead of putting plastic type a b c and d and another way they could've improved their experiment would be tpoput how many weights they clamped to the plastic for each plastic so we can see how far the plastics stretched and how many weights were used
3118,2,1,one way the students can improve there experiment is to do a other trial to see if they misssted anything
3119,2,3,a based on the students data plastic type b is the weakest plastic out of them all and the strogest polymer plastic is plastic a because it was stretched the least p b the students could've included more discription on the plastic like each plastics length or width in order to show that everything was the same in length and width also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used
3120,2,2,a pased on the results plastic b is the most stretchy and a is the least the order is from most shotely to least b d c a p b the student could of improved experimental design by being more specific he could change bottom edge in step 3 to edge of the side of the table additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights
3121,2,2,my conclusion from the data presented is plastic type b and c through b and c increased higher but d stays constant at 20 those were only with two trials the student should have done more trials and should have stated the length of the paper
3122,2,3,a conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type a is the strongest this is ture because plastic a stretched the least about on average two ways that the students could have improved their lab is by saying how long the types of plastic should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and how many weights should be added to the clamp because there could have been an error when the plastics were different lengths with different amounts of weights and this would make the data inaccurate
3123,2,2,i conclude that plastic b stretched the most but plastic d was constant he could have added more that's he should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate
3124,2,3,a the stretchiest kind of plastic was type b because it stretched the most p p b the student could have given the weights and the original length of the plastic in the procedure and made sure they were constant
3125,2,1,based on the students data it is possible to see how much each type of plastic stretched but not how much weight was needed to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastic p two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to make a more detailed procedure include the weight of the type of plastic clanes instructions etc and too create a clearer table that includes the types of plastic the original length and the weight added
3126,2,3,plastic type b stretched the most in both trials one and two plastic type a stretched the least in both of the trials p the students could have improved the experiment design by conduction more trials and so stating how many weights they added on top of the clamps the results werent valid
3127,2,2,a based on the data the most stretchable plastic was plastic b b c it stretched 22 mm on the first trial and 23 mm on the second trail also the least stretchable plastic was plastic a b c it only stretched in during t1 12 during t2 plastic c stretched only a bit more than plastic a plastic d stretched 20 mm's both times making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the 4
3128,2,2,a my hypothesis was correct plastic type 'a' stretched the least during the experiment i noticed that the plastic that stretched the least was most commonly used in our town to hold the heaviest items p b to improve the validabil of the experiment the students should have used a specific amount of each plastic not just a 'sample' also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top this would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use
3129,2,1,based on the students data it is concluded that their wasn't much stretchability from the plastic samples sample a increased 2mm from t1 to t2 sample b increased 1mm from t1 to t2 sample c decreased by 1mm from t1 to t2 sample d stayed the same in t1 and t2 this experiment could be improved if the student had a control which would be the measure of each plastic sample without any weight added they could also repeat the experiment
3130,2,2,a plastic b was the most stretchy it was 22mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched 1 more millimeter the second most strechy polimer was plastic d i remained at 20mm both trials p b the students could have improved the experimental design validity of the results bys i specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2 they could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights
3131,2,1,out of all the polmer plastics type a stretched a total of 2 mm as the best one p to have a control and to make sure to tell us how long the plastic is
3132,2,3,a in this experiment it can be concluded that plastic b had the most stretchability with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2 also i can conclude that plastic a of the polymer plastics stretched the least with an average of 11m overall then plastic c stretched an average of 12mm and plastic d stretched 20mm p b two ways to improve this experiment would have been to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length as the add to the end of the plastic they could also add a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid
3133,2,1,a in this data it shows how far different type of plastic can be stretched plastic type a was stretched 2mm within trial 1 and 2 plastic type b was stretched 1mm lastly plastic type d was stretched 0mm in conclusion plastic type a was the easiest to stretch p b two ways it could have been improved was a have more tests and what what type of plastic
3134,2,3,through this data recorded from the experiment we can conclude that plastic a had the strongest polymer setup this is because it stretched the least throughout both trials one way this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents for example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same also to improve validity the student should have had the same starting length of plastics thing this
3135,2,0,a plastic type a was strethier because on the first trial it streched out to 10mm and in the second trial it streched out to 12mm it had streched longer but plastic type d seems to have been stronger it only streched 20mm through out both of the trials
3136,2,1,a i think that plastic d in both trials had the most weights out of the three other plastics from the student's data p b two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is one that the student could have done five trials instead of two to see the difference also instead of four plastics but five he or she could improve the statement too
3137,2,2,in conclusion in trial one plastic type b streched the most while plastic type a was the lowest in trial two plastic type b streched the furtherist p measure the height of the table weigh the weights
3138,2,1,a plastic type b was able to hold the most weights for each trial p b two ways they could have improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials for each plastic or they could have let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes
3139,2,0,a based on the student data table ii can conclude that plastic types a is the strongest because it didn't stretch that far in the first trial it only stretch 10mm and in t2 it only strech 12 i can also conclued that plastic type d is the weakes because in both trial it strech 20mm p b the student could have improve the experiment either by leaving the weights on longer or by add more heavier weights
3140,2,2,based on this student's data the type with the most amount of stretching was plastic type b with 20mm and plastic a had the least with 10 the first trial and 12 the second the student could've conducted more trials as well as stated what the types of plastic were
3141,2,3,the plastic with the least stretch would be plastic a because it had a small change from 10mm to 12mm two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table
3142,2,3,a i concluded that plastic type b had the best stretchability and plastic type a had the least p b the student should have included in the procedure how many weight to put on the clamp and describe where on the bottom edge of the plastic to put the clamp
3143,2,0,in conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only 1 2 mm this is not a very big change in length the data also showed that for one of the plastics after stretched lost a mm of length so this was not a very succsecfull lab p one thing that they could do to improve this is to tell us what kind of plastic to use so the experiment is easier to test and also to have a control variable to really see the change in plastics
3144,2,1,my conclusion is that type b is the most stretchy based on the results the student should have improved this by doing it in even trials even though other could be how put there's experiment on the table this would have improved the validity
3145,2,1,a type d plastic stretched the same amount in trial 1 and 2 it stretched 20mm p b in the procedure the students can get rid of step 7 because step 6 basically states the same thing also they could have done three trials for more data
3146,2,2,in conclusion plastic d stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of 20mm each plastic type a b both stretched a little more in trial 2 and plastic type c stretched less plastic type b stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm p improve 1 show in graph beggining length of plastic p 2 create a t3 and try it once more p 3 add another 3 trials with different weight
3147,2,2,in conclusion plastic type b is the most polymer for stretchability because in both trials it erected the most making it the most stretched out of the all other polymers p two ways the student could have improved is by saying which plastics the students used for each so the people would know if the data is correct and by saying how much weight was used to stretch the plastic
3148,2,3,a in conclusion plastic type
3149,2,2,a plastic type b can be stretched the farthest p b 1 the students could have specified how heavy the weights were p 2 they could've let the plastic hang for more than 5 minutes
3150,2,3,a conclusion could be that plastic type b had the best results for strechability with 22m and 23m to make the expirement more valid the group could haved run more trials and they also could used more detail in the procedure like stated how heavy the weights were
3151,2,2,i think that the data they have is correct but it shows that plastic type a is the only one that has a lower trial than the other types two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to tell how heavy the weights were and what plastic was used
3152,2,1,a in conclusion plastic b and d have more stretchability than a and c because plastics b and d stretched an average of 21mm while plastics a and c stretched an average of 12mm p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to do more trials and to add a control
3153,2,2,based on the student's data it is easy to conclude that plastic type d was the most constant through both trials with a measurement of 20 mm the student's though could have improved their experiment by doing more trials and by also being more specific for example saying what types of plastic they used instead of saying a b c or d also they could have said how much weight was added so that it is clear and exact
3154,2,1,a in conclusion based on the student's data polymer plastic b stretch the most in both trials done the least that stretch both trials was type a leaving us to see b is the most stretchable from all for types p b she could have included a time limit for the plastic to dangle freely second she could have made a graph to have it be more visual
3155,2,3,based on the data we can tell that plastic type a stretches the least amount of all other types of plastic it only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others the students could improve their experiment by adding another trial this always verifies the validity of an experiment they could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment
3156,2,1,a conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more plastic type d was the same in trail 1 and 2 the students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials
3157,2,0,based on the student's data plastic d stretched the same length for both trials two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to on the data table say how long each type of plastic is before the student started the experiment another way the student could of improved the experimental design would be to have done only one trial instead of two
3158,2,3,i cannot draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table the students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table they also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh
3159,2,1,a the students wanted to see which plastic was mor strechibal b two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by doing a 3rd trial say how far off the table
3160,2,3,a based on the data they can conclude that plastic b stretched the most p b they could have included the mass of the weights added they also should have included the size of the plastic samples
3161,2,0,my conclusion is trials t2 stretched better than t2 the student could have used a different type of plastic and they could have just made the sample very larger
3162,2,3,a based on the student data plastic type b stretched the most plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm p b the student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add
3163,2,2,a plastic type b stretched the most probably hefty or ziplock p b taken thickness temp in room original length etc
3164,2,3,the plastic type b stretched the most out of all the other plastic types two ways the student could have improved his experiment was 1 to include in his data table how much weight he used on the clamp 2 to include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table
3165,2,3,the students wanted to determine in this experiment which type of plastic a b c or d was able to stretch the most based on the data plastic b had the best stretchability and was able to stretch 22 mm in the first trial and 23 mm in the second trial the students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results to improve their experimental design they could have been more specific and stated how many weights should be added to the plastics and to better control the experiment
3166,2,1,based on the data table i would say that plastic d was your strongest plastic because it didn't stretch one way they could of improved the experiment was to run a trial 3 to tell plastic d another way they could of improved the experiment is by adding many weights
3167,2,2,based on the students data the plastic b is the most strechable polymer plastic plastic a is the least strechable this is because plastic b was streched at 22mm 1st trial and 23mm 2nd trial comparing it to the others it streched the furthest plastic a only stretched 10mm 1st trial and 12mm 2nd trial to improve this experiment the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic they also should have done one more trial to ensure validity three trials can help make this definite
3168,2,2,in conclusion the plastics stretched more during the second trial than the first the second trial the first the second trial all plastics stretched further except for type c and d which did not change two ways to make this better would have been to do a third trial and to specify how much the weights were
3169,2,3,a based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most at an average of 22 3mm while plastic a stretched a mere 11mm average plastic d stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13 5 average mm the average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic p b the student could have improved the validity and design by recording how much weight was used which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much a sample that is 10cm but stretched 10mm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm but the data table fails to recognize that
3170,2,1,in conclusion all the plastic types are all different amount stretched the plastic stretching out in trials 1 2 are going up and down p the student could have improved by doing a third trial to show more of the results explain why they added more weight
3171,2,3,based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type a was the strongest because it stretched the least amount p b for the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics and to improve the validity they should have done a third trial
3172,2,0,a in the polymer investigation there werent a lot of change plastic type a stretched only 2 mm type b stretched 1 mm type c stretched 1mm and d stayed the same p b could of been more accurate with the steps on the procedure
3173,2,0,a in conclusion plastic type b has the highest stretchability and plastic type a was the lowest this shows that a is the most non flexible and the most durable to stretchy tasks plastic b is the stretchiest and can hold up to 23mm p they could've added a list of materials in the beginners and a hypothesis to see what they were trying to test
3174,2,1,the plastic type a is shown to be the the strongest plastic type mean while the plastic type b shows to be the plastic that stretched out the longest
3175,2,0,in conclusion based on the students data there are four different type of plastic based of the plastic are t1 t2 their amount stretched mm and based in the dutch table t2 is more stretched than t1 the students can describe experimental based in diffent plastic and the students can based in that data table the t2 is more stretched
3176,2,3,a after investigating how much each plastic type stretched a conclusion has made that plastic type b stretched most than d than c and plastic type a stretched the least b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was to first use the same starting length of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific about how much weight to add
3177,2,3,based on the data plastic type b stretched the most out of all of the plastics type a stretched an average of 11mm type c stretched an average 13 5mm and type d stretched 20mm but type b stretched 20cm but type b stretched the most with an average of 22 5mm p b the student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed another thing the student can do is add one more trial
3178,2,2,a conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is plastic type b had the greatest amount of stretchability in mm in both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type in trial 1 22mm and trial 2 23mm 3 the student could have made this lab more valid by adding the different types of plastics that were labeled a b c and d and also the student could have set an exact length for each plastic so they all started at the same measurement
3179,2,2,a the students could have concluded that plastic type b has the largest amount of stretchability because type b stretched 22 min in trial one and 23 mm in trial 2 p b the students could have improved the validity of their experiment by 1 doing more trials to collect more data 2 allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min
3180,2,2,a a conclusion that can be brought from the data is that plastic type b is the best type of plastic fore stretchability because it stretched 22mm and 23mm on it's trials p b two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by having or stating that the plastics all had the same initial measurement also the student could have named the type of plastics the validity can be questioned because it is unknown if they were the same length to begin with and the plastic is unknown
3181,2,2,based on the students data plastic b stretches more than the other plastics the students could improve this experiment by checking the temperature of the room because plastic's elasticity varies on the temperature another improvement would be to measure the amount of weight that is being put into each bag
3182,2,2,the data showas the plastic for stretching more in b because maybe the put or did different procesure but experiment d have the same type of stretching the procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times the students have to do the procesure they have to do the experiment like three time as or more the need to have all the materials and put it in order the need to have his own question find his conclusion
3183,2,1,my conclusion is that plastic type d stretched the farthest both trials they could have done another trial and they could have put more weights on the clamp so it can stretch more
3184,2,1,plastic type a held up best against the wheight of the wheights so i would use the plastic out of any where plastic type d expanded and stretched the most p two ways the student could have improved the experiment was one name the plastics and two tell how much the wheights wheighed
3185,2,3,a a conclusion i can draw with the data present is that some plastics are more stretchy than others for example plastic b is much more stretchy then plastic a p b to improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched
3186,2,0,one way it would have been good to improve the experiment is listing the steps or procedure properly
3187,2,3,a my conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic b has the highest stretchability i say this because plastic b had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the other plastics in this expirement p b there are many ways this student could have improved their designs one way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights they could have also add more trials to improve their design
3188,2,1,a based on the data that the st recordity i think plastic b will work better with 23mm when the stud 22mm and plastic t2 with 23mm when the student have to add weight to clam and allow for 5 minutes p b anex could add more trial and try other type of plastic
3189,2,1,from the students data looks like the first trials were good but the second trials the plastic stretches more it looks like the second trial for a b c o hanged there for a by with the weights the last trial the student could have improved the experimental design if it would of have more plastics and add ore minutes to see what would happen if it stayed longer then 5 minutes another way could have been if you knew how many weights you were putting on the clamp so youwill know how many weights and how long would make this experiment improve
3190,2,3,3 a plastic a is the most resistant and the strongest because it stretched the least out of the 4 plastics this is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains p b the experiment could be improved by using the same amount of the weights on each type of plastic this would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately also the trial should be performed more than 2 times since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial this variation would be minimized with more trials
3191,2,3,base on the data table plastic type b stretched the most amount in 22 mm in trial 1 and 23 mm in trial before apping the two ways the students could have improved their experiment better is by lableing how much weight was the weight add they to the clamp and also by adding more trials to see more accracy
3192,2,1,in the procedure it doesn't have a clear problem of what is happening on the experiment on procedure 7 it doesn't tell you the trial that thy did for the first one two ways the students can aprove is on the last trial explains whats the first trial is and not make the person reading it not to know whats the trial is the last way is for number four it says add weights to the clamp and alowthem to hange for 5 minutes how heavy are the weights you need to use on the experiment
3193,2,2,a based on the data below it is saying that the plastic could stretch depending on what or how strong the plastic is b explain what is clamp have a third trial or have lest durable plastic to do the trials
3194,2,0,3 4 increased by 1 1 4 decreased by 1 and 1 4 stayed the p b two ways of improving p 1 used a different weight for second trial p 2 or used four different types of plastic
3195,2,2,based on the student data i can draw the conclusion that plastic type a only stretched an average of 11mm so it was the strongest and stretched out of all the other plastic types p b the student could have improved the experiment by doing one more trial for a total of three trials for each plastic type for accuracy and he she could have measured the initial length of the plastic
3196,2,3,nsr
3197,2,3,a in conclusion we found that plastic type b had the most stretchability it stretched out the most both trials and that plastic type a was less stretchable p b two ways the students can improve there experiment design is to do three more so the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they put on the clamp
3198,2,0,one way the coud of used rocks instead of weights to improve the experiment design p second way instead of measure the length after the weight they should measure the length of the plasic while the weight was ve there
3199,2,1,a conclusion i can make based on the student's data is that plastic a can only stretch about 11 mm plastic b can strech about 22 5mm plastic c can strech about 13 5 mm and plastic d can only strech 20 mm one way the experiment could have been improved is by skeeping the weight added through out the experiments the same the second way to improve the experiment is for the plastic to be maesured in asmaller unit rather than mm
3200,2,1,a my conclusion is that plastic type d was the strongest of them all p b two way he can improve the experiment is be using the same amount of time and the same amount of plastics
3201,2,2,a the conclusion i can get from the data is plastic a went from 10mm to 12mm plastic b went from 22mm to 23mm plastic c went down from 1mm to 13mm and plastic d stayed at 20mm p b the way they could improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial and showed how much weight they used
3202,2,3,a a conclusion i can draw from the experiment is that that plastic type b has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest amount of mm which wass 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2 p b the student could improve this experiment by specifying a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all begin on the same level and therefore the data is accurate also the student could specify how many milimeters of each plastic should be taped to the table so they all start put the same length make the data more accurate
3203,2,3,a plastic type b was the most stretchable while plastic type a was the least p b they could add more trials and be more specific when the say weights by adding how heavy the weights are
3204,2,0,it will be not that different from the other test that was done because if there went down or up a little he could have done a bar graph for the things he was trying to figure out about it all or just had at least told the time he did it
3205,2,3,a plastic type b has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm p b one way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type
3206,2,2,each plastic type had stretched about 1 2 millimeters as where type d did not stretch much therefore the type d plastic was the strongest p two ways the students should have improved there experimental design would be not to use the same plastic each trial do it three times instead of two and include the length from floor to table
3207,2,2,a based on the students data plastic type a had the strongest resistance against weight and therefore makes it stronger than the rest because plastic a stretched 10 12mm while plastic b stretched 22 23mm p b the students should have had the same size plastic strips for each type a third and an averaged measurement for each plastic would make the data even more valid
3208,2,2,a plastic type b stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least this shows that plastic type b have less cross linking of its polymers while plastic a had the greatest amount of cross linking p b one way the students could have improved their experiment could be add another trial to get a bigger range to make sure the data is accurate another way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more plastic types for a longer sample size
3209,2,1,3 a the students experiment was a good experiment because they had 4 different plastic types they had two trials to check and recheds for experiment p b they could have had more trials they should had more plastic types
3210,2,0,a based on the data as you see different type of plastic they would be different or the same on both trials for example plastic type a first trial is werent stretchable and when you repeat it again it would change p b two ways to make it better was have more different plastics and maybe add more weight to the clamp to see what changes
3211,2,2,a my conclusion according to the data would be that plastic b stretched the most p b some ways the students could improve their experiment is if they said how much weights was on the plastics also they should of not have done the second trial exactly the same as the first cause there would be no difference so the data should be the same as the first because the second trial was supposed to be done exactly the same as the first
3212,2,3,a plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics p b the students could have repeated the experiment a third time and made sure that they were adding the same size weights everytime
3213,2,3,a plastic type b was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length plastic type a was the most resistant to stretch b the students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results in step 1 of the procedure it says take a sample of one type of plastic b measasure its length this is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment this is important b c the longest should be the piece is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch finally students need to change step 9 add some weights to a specific number of weight this is important b c if they put more weight on one plastic it will stretch farther than a plastic w less weight attached
3214,2,0,i guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break p they should of used a different type of plastic to see how it works out
3215,2,2,in conclusion plastic a was the least streched after two tries also plastic b was the most stretchest after the two tries the student could have improved the experimental design by being more specific and also measured the length of the materials before doing the experiment
3216,2,1,based on the student's data i can conclude that plastic type b is the strongest for example in trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm p two ways the students could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial and increase the amount of time it hangs
3217,2,1,a plastic type b is more flevable and stronger some plasticstretch more after the first trial like 10mm 12mm p b i think having more trials so his data can be more percise and having a catrol
3218,2,2,plastic type b is the stretchiest while type a is the least stretchy two ways they could improve the experiment is by adding more trials and check to make sure all other variables are constant such as temperature
3219,2,1,plastic type b stretched more than all other plastic types p one way the experiment could have been improved is if they kept on adding weights until the plastic broke and measured how much weight it can hold another way is of puting one plastic on top of another and add the weight and see if that changes how far one on the plastic stretches
3220,2,0,the students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from p the students could have improved the experiment if the student picked a certain type of plastic not any type other reason is that they not the weights in the same spot in trial 1 and trial 2
3221,2,2,a in conclusion of this experiment plastic type b seemed to stretch the most in both trials of the experiment also it seems as if plastic type a was the stacking in the experiment as it only stretched a half the amount of plastic type a p b instead of add weights they could have given a specific amount of time they also could have given the original lengths of each plastic
3222,2,2,a based on our results we can conclude that plastic b was the weakest because it stretched the most plastic a was the strongest because it stretched the least p b they could have mentioned more contents such as the weight they put on the bag sample every trial p they should have had a control atrial where no weights were added
3223,2,2,a conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic b was the stretchiest plastic also that plastic a was the least stretchy make all the plastic samples the same length and make sure that t1 and t2 have the same amount of plastic
3224,2,1,3 a the plastics a b stretched farther the 2nd time but d c stayed the same or went down p b stretched it a third time or measure it when it was hanging off the table
3225,2,2,a based on the student's data the plastic that has has the most stretchability is plastic type a it started at 10 mm and then the weight added on it stretched to 12mm plastic type d has no stretchability it remained at 20 mm for the second trial p b one way the student could have improved the results and validity of them is by stating how much weight was added to each type of plastic bag also if you record the length a was before adding weights you can see how for each bag stretched from itself right now there is no constant in the experiment
3226,2,3,based on the students data it can be seen that plastic b stretched 22mm t1 and 23mm t2 making it the most stretchable p the students could have improved the experiment by including the length of the plastics before stretching them also they need to include how much weight to add to the plastic making it the same for each plastic to be valid
3227,2,2,the conclusion of this experiment would be that type b was the most amount stretched it stretched 22 then try 2 was 23 meanwhile type a stretched the least in try one a stretched 10 2nd try stretched 12 the two ways students can improvr the experimenta design is to always give it a 3rd try what is your control
3228,2,1,from reading this students procedure and reviewing their data i have realized some plastics are significantly better than others the data shows that plastic type b that stretched 22mm and 23mm and plastic type d stretched 20mm both times types b and c because that table shows a that stretched 10 and 12mm are type c stretched 14 and 13 mm in conclusion plastic type b and d are much stronger than a and c b two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data also running a third trial will improve their results
3229,2,1,in the second trial plastic a the stretch increased by two bara plastic b the second trial increased by one mm almost it decreased one mm now in plastic d the stretch stayed the same two ways student could have improved their lab or validity one was to have a third trial so you could see if there would have been a great change or to see which results were closer to results one and two to make your final choice another way to improve the lab was to try different measurements of plastic
3230,2,2,according to the experiment the type of plastic that had the greatest ability to stretch was plastic b in both trials this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest in the first trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 22mm p the student could have improved the experiment by using a certain amount of weights added so that all the plastics would be under the same pressure and to add a control such as no weights the control would have made a good bomparison to the data gathered and the amount of weights would have made created controlled variables
3231,2,2,plastic type b has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics two ways that the students could improve on there experimental design and valitedy is by having a control and by telling the reader the amount of weights to the plastic so that they can replicate the procedure
3232,2,2,based on the students data the plastic type d was the stretcheyest and plastic type a was the least streechyest at of all the other plastics one way the student could have improved his results was if he she added the same amount of weights everytime also if they did more trials they would probly get more validity results
3233,2,0,in conclusion you can conclude that plastic b measured the longest which was 12 t1 and 23 t2 also you can see that plastic type d had came the closes to plastic b plastic d measured 20mm for both trials p b they could improve their experiment if the actually added more minutes each trial to see different outcome and compare also could've added more weights
3234,2,2,based on this student's results i can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type b type b plastic stretched 22 mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial some thing that could have been done to improve the validity of the experiment would be to do a third trial in an experiment can make the results more accurate depending on the amount of trials there are in your experiment
3235,2,1,the data shows that the plastic types stretched about the same in both trials in the procedures the student must say which she is recording the data i think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each different plastic
3236,2,2,a the order from the most stretchable to the lest strechable is plastic types b first d second c third and a last plastic type b streched the furthest at 22mm 1st trail and 23mm the second trial a was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second p b the student could have done more trails or they could have let it hand longer
3237,2,1,a in conclusion based on the students data the plastic samples stretched slightly more in the second trial plastic type d was the only plastic that kept its length constant b to improve the validity of the results i would've measured the plastic's width to improve the design i would've used a fifth plastic type to expand my results
3238,2,1,the plastic that were being stretched all come out to a different length on the second trial of stretching the some plastics someway the numbers would forely the some give or take a few the student could have improved the experiment by leaving the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a different result also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment
3239,2,2,the polymer type b had the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was the greatest at 22 5mm stretched average it was higher than type d's 20mm average types a and c were less stretchable than type b by 11 5mm and 9mm respectively the valiability of the results could be increased by the reasing the amount of trials this way the averages would be closer to what they should be the design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights 2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results
3240,2,0,to test four different polymer for stretchability the student would need to record the data from the investigation to procedure and perform a second trial exactly just like the first trial two ways a student could improve the experimental design and the validity of the result is first off could try two more 'test' trials to see if the plastic type and amount stretched can be improved second off could use the conclusion to help out with the experiment
3241,2,1,in conclusion the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type b in trail one was statend 22mm and trail two was 23mm while plastic type a got 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second trail so over all the plastics type b is the one that can hold up the longest and is more durable one way this lab could do is to add more trails then another improvement could be to explain exly in the produre to get three more bags
3242,2,2,a after evaluating the student's data it appears that plastic type a stretches the least 10mm 12mm and plastic type b stretches the most 22mm 23mm therefore sample b is the most stretchy p b the student could have improved the experimental validity by specifying how heavy the weights were that were being added to the bags another way to improve the experiment design would be yo test the experiment in multiple trials using a different length of time each trial
3243,2,3,a from the data i've seen i can conclude that plastic type b stretched the most even though between both trials it only increased 1 mm 22 23 but on the otherhand plastic type d only hit 20 and stayed 20 still being close to b p b i know two way that i could improve the experiment first the student should say how long each plastic should be second the student should say how much weight is being put on each time
3244,2,3,according to their the students results plastic sample a is the least stretchy while sample b was the most stretchy i do not however believe these results are valid they should have used exact measurement when saying to add weight to the clamp another thing they could have done was added a third trial for increased accuracy and to that same note come up with an average stretch distance for each sample making it even more accurate
3245,2,1,so they should of told us if we have to wait five wen for all three bottles or do we time it different one another also do we use the same length for all three plastic bag or are we spouse to use a different length for all three plastic bag
3246,2,2,a the student are trying to figure out which plastic can stretch more than the other without braking adding weights p b the students could improve the experiment if they were to add a specific number of weights to each plastic also having the same measurement size for each plastic
3247,2,3,a based on the data plastic type b had the most stretchability followed by type a c and lastly type a p b one way the students could have improved their experiment design would be to identify a set mass of the weights the students also identify a certain amount of type to have the same resistanes
3248,2,1,as we can come to a close the students in results were very close numbers when they did trial 1 and then trial 2 we can see that when they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm this is what we can conclude about the data
3249,2,1,from the data it's drawn that type b has the most stretchability than the others in trial one it held the highest weight count for 20 weights in the second trial it had a total of 23 for the experiment to give a more accurate result the weights should have been added on past the limit for each plastic that way data could show how many weights each held until breaking strengthening the results for or against the hypothesis
3250,2,0,a both plastics no matter how far its stretch weather its in trial one or trial two is that their both about the same mm maybe off by one two p b two switch up the difference from trial 2 to trial 1 also to use different plastics to see different results
3251,2,2,a from the data table it can be said that plastic a is the most stretchy and that the other plastics have little to no stretchability p b p 1 the length of the plastics need to be kept constant p more trials need to be done at the minimal three
3252,2,3,a after finding all of the measurements and recording the data i can see that plastic type b has the most stretchability then plastic type s then c and finally a which has the least amount of stretchability
3253,2,3,the student can conclude that type b was the most stretchable while type a was the least the student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched the student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied
3254,2,1,a the student tested the plastic 4 different types they altumetly had the same close 1 to 2 mm streach rate p b the student could have stated how much each whight should whigh he could have also changed the results then messure or record the difference
3255,2,1,a plastic type a was able to overall stretch the most compared to other three plastic types p b the students could have improved the validity of the results by having more trials and by having a control group
3256,2,0,the plastic streched more and more each time p i think that the student could have been more specific when writing out the steps because it would have been easier to understand the data
3257,2,1,a based on the student's data i conclude that plastic type d has the most stretchability than all the other plastic types in both trials they stretched to 20mm while the other plastic types didnt that far p two ways the student would have improved the experimental design validity is 1 did one more trial to make sure its possible stretchability 2 used same materials
3258,2,2,a the students concluded plastic b can stretch the farthest but plastic a is the most durable p b the students could had a control the students could have made the samples the same size
3259,2,0,one way the student could improve the experiment better is by putting the plastic in both directions at the same time another way he could improve is he could add heavier weights to get better data p in conclusion when he added the weights to one end that made the plastic stretch and increasing its size
3260,2,0,the conclusion
3261,2,1,based on the student's data the conclusion can be made because their is nothing to the test the results to this experiment can be improved by measuring the initial length at the polymer to show the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion this can also improve by adding a control to test against their variables to add to the validity
3262,2,3,a plastic b is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most plastic a stretched the least p b 1 the student needs to specify how many weights should be added how much those weights shall weigh p 2 the student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table
3263,2,2,based on the students data you can't really come to a conclusion because there isn't enough data two ways the student could improve the experiment are by adding more trials to the data is better and by stating that all of the plastics were cut to the same length you would want to do that because if the plastics aren't all the same lengths that could affect the data
3264,2,1,a plastic b stretched the most amount therefore it is the most stretchabil b the students could have measured the length after 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes they could have added more weights
3265,2,3,plastic b had the greatest stretchability the students should have included how much the weights they used weighed and how many weights they used also they should have included another trial
3266,2,3,a plastic b stretches the most p b the student should have kept the length and width of the plastic samples constant and specified how much weight to attatch
3267,2,3,a plastic type b has the highest stretchabilty p b the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their results they could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant also they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy
3268,2,0,for plastic tube a and b the amount stretched went up a point for plastic tube c it went down a pont and for d the plastic stretched stayed the same p they could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min
3269,2,2,my conclusion based on this data is that plastic type b stretched the most in both the first and second trial one way this student could have made their experiment better would be by re arranging their procedure and doing 7 before 6 another way they could have improved would be by allowing the reader to know how heavy the weights were that were used in this experiment
3270,2,2,a plastic type b is the most stretchable p b the validity of the experiment would be improved if a control were added the control in this experiment would be a plastic hanging off the table with no weight for five minutes also the experiment does not specify whether to use the same amount of weight for all plastics or the specific amount thats suppose to be used to improve the experiment the specific amount of weight should be mentioned and should be held constant for all plastics
3271,2,0,two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results was probelly trying the experiment with a bigger cup not a small cup second would be then potting more weight to the cup and then maybe their would be a difference on the experiment
3272,2,2,a plastic type b stretched more than any of the other types of plastic in both of its trials p b one way the student could have improved their experimental results would be to have a third trial of all the practice to enhance precision and accuracy of results another way to improve thes results would be to average the figures from the trials
3273,2,3,the conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type b stretched the most to improve the experimental design the students can give a better understanding on how to hold down the plastic and where to put the clamp they should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much
3274,2,1,based on the data each plastic improved on t2 two ways they could have improved the experiment was by making sure they used the sam weight for each trial and also use a stop watch to get exact time
3275,2,2,in conclusion plastic type b has the most stretchability also plastic type a has the least stretchability the student could have had another trial
3276,2,3,based on the student's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type b stretched the farthest amount one way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same
3277,2,2,most plastics stretched 1 to 2 inches longer one didn't stretch at all and another actually become shorter i think this data is wrong when you tape the plastic tape an inch on the table then add the inch to the final result they should also put a certain amount of weights
3278,2,2,in conclusion out of the 4 tested polymer plastics plastic type b proved to have the best stretchability because it stretched 22 mm during t1 and 23 mm during t2 one way the students could've improved their experiment is to preform a 3rd trial so results can be proved to be more reliable a second way they can improve is to run a trial where the plastics hold weights for maybe 10 minutes so they could conclude if maybe some plastics would break in the process of being stretched
3279,2,2,one way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add how much weight they were putting on the plastics another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial
3280,2,3,based on the data i would conclude that plastic type b stretched the most as it had an average of 22 5 mm stretched one way the student could have improved his experiment design would have been to add another trial so that the results would have been more valid the to more results to a range another way the student could have improved his experiment would have been to give a specific mass for the weights attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results
3281,2,0,the conclusion that can be drawn from the label is that the second trial was more succesful at being stretched out two ways that the students could of improved the design of the results are increasing the amount of time the plastic was stretched also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the clamp to to me it would be also helpful if a control was run to compare results
3282,2,3,a from the given results one can conclude that plastic type b is the stretchiest type out of the four that were tested p b however there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved one improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic if the sizes vary the data found is useless uncomparable another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials you can not obtain consistancy a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment in only two trials
3283,2,2,a in conclusion the plastic type d stretched the most compared to any other plastic p b one way the experiment could be improved would be to keep the length of the given plastic equal another improvement would live to add the same amount if weight to each plastic and lot the weight the procedure
3284,2,0,a in conclusion after five minutes the plastic types were stretched longer for plastics a and b plastic c decreased in trial 2 and plastic d stayed the same p b two ways the student could have improved the experiment are 1 added or decreased the weights amount in trial 2 2 let the weights hang for longer shorter amount of time
3285,2,0,the student should have wrote the weight of the structer the color and more about the size
3286,2,1,a i can conclude from the results plastic type a stretched the most out of all the other plastic types p b they could of added more details to the procedure for example to record all our data
3287,2,1,a the plastic type b was the stretchiest and a was the least stretchy p b one way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like 5 10 15 minutes the other way is adding more weights
3288,2,2,i concluded that plastic type b was the most stretchable p one way they could improved this experiment was by completing three or more trials p a second way they could improve this experiment is to limit the weights they put on the plastics then have it go up as a whole
3289,2,2,in the experiment plastic type b stretched the most with 222 23mm in length type a stretched least with 10 12mm in stretching c stretched the second least 14 13mm and d closely followed b 20mm in stretching it is very clear that plastic type b has the most stretchability and type a has the least to improve this experiment one could designate how much weight should be applied to the clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the four plastics also a control group could be added
3290,2,2,a conclusion i can draw from this experiment is that the second trial t2 had increased the amount of plastic stretched all expert plastic type c which remioved the same two ways the students could have improved the experimental designs was by measuring the weights for each clamp and another way was to have a third trial
3291,2,1,a conclusion could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at the student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups
3292,2,3,a plastic type b stretched the most during both trials of this experiment p b first the student should have used the same length of each plastic finally the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table
3293,2,3,the conclusion drawn from the data would be that plastic type b stretches the most because it was the longest length after being stretched the student could improve the experiment by adding more trials to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from the student could also cut the plastic to the same starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start and the results would be more accurate
3294,2,1,a the whole procedure worked out well i think the results came out to be almost the same when they repeated it p b i think the student should have 'did' a third trial also i think he should have chase two different plastics to see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
3295,2,3,in conclusion to the polymer investigation lab it is clearly known that plastic type b was the most stretchable while plastic type a was the least according to the data collected to improve the experiment the lab testers should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and recorded it also they should've made sure they used the same weights
3296,2,2,in conclusion the polymer plastic that was the most stretchable according to our experiments data was plastic type a 10mm 12mm the polymer plastic that we found to be the least stretchable was plastic c which actually shrank it went from 14mm to 13 mm plastic b stretched 1mm and plastic d was impervous to the weight and didn't change a couple of ways the students can improve this experiment would be to at more trials to increase the validity and they can specify the actual weight that they used for the experiment
3297,2,2,a in conclusion it seems that plastic b has stretched the most because the highest it stretched is 23mm and all the others we lower at 12 14 and 20mm p b one way the student could have improved their experiment is to tell in the prosedure how long to cut the plastic so they all start at the same size therefore these results are not valid because we don't know if they were on even length when they started
3298,2,2,a plastic type b stretched the most in both t1 and t2 p b the students could have improved by stretching it differently in different ways that way you can see better as to which b stretches the best another way it could have improved would be by it saying to do things in the same place with the same measurements
3299,2,1,a the data that the students recorded is incorrect p b two ways the students could have improve the experiment by adding a control and by adding another performance trial to the experiment
3300,2,3,after looking at the data it showed that plastic type b stretched the most at 22 mm t1 and 23 mm t2 two ways the experiment could have been improved could be to tell us the types of plastics and their starting lengths also to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four
3301,2,2,a the conclusion i drew based on the student's data is that plastic type b stretches the most p b two ways the student can improve the design and validity at the results is to state how much weight you add every five minutes and what types of plastics were used for this experiment
3302,2,1,when looking at the students data i can conclude that plastic type a had the least stretchability reaching 10 12 mm on the other hand plastic type b had the greatest amount of stretchability reaching 22 23 mm two ways the student could improve his experiment design is 1 he could have used a control to have a more controlled experiment 2 he could have done each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes and so on this would increase the validity of the results
3303,2,2,the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results by 1 having all plastic pieces be the same length 2 add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic
3304,2,3,based on the students data i conclude that plastic type b has the greatest ability to stretch the students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated and they could have done more trials so they could have more confidence in their results
3305,2,3,a plastic type b is the stretchable polymer plastic p b the student should have specified a constant length to be used for each trial also the students should have specified the weight being used
3306,2,2,a 1 after looking at the students data their conclusion may be plastic type ''b'' stretches as the most because in t1 stretched 22 mm and on t2 it got 23 comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23 p b two ways the students could improved their experimental design are p 1 do it again p 2 compare their results with another group
3307,2,2,a based on the students' data it can be concluded that plastic type b stretched the farthest it stretch 22mm in t1 and 23mm in t2 p b two ways to improve the validity are to say how many pounds the weights are and to state the exact name of the plastics and not just bathe them a b c and d this would make the experiment more accurate
3308,2,1,a the students data shows that polymers b d were the stretchiest while the plastic types a c were not that flexible b the student could have improved his her experimental design by using a control which he she can compare the results to a plastic used the student may also perform more trials in order to get an averge amount stretched mm
3309,2,3,i say that type b plastic would work the best because it stretches more one way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights we didn't know the weight of them they could have also repeated the trials
3310,2,2,a it is evident that polymer d had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials it is ultimately the most flexible stretchable substance out of the 4 given in the experiment p b 1 the polymer should be attached with a sturdier applicant than tape p 2 the ammount of added weight should be specified
3311,2,2,a in conclusion i think that the plastic type b stretched the most and plastic a is the least stretchable p b two ways the students could have improven the experiment was by one telling us what type of plastic to use and two telling us how fare to hang it of the table
3312,2,0,a conclusion that can be drawn from the data is plastic b is the strogest tape out of the other 3 plastics t1 t2 t2 t3 plastic d was the second strongest and plastic a was the weakest plastic and the second weakest was plastic c two way the student could have improved the experiment is by using tighter tape for tyding the plastic and act the 4 top plastic types in the wand
3313,2,2,based on the data i can conclude that plastic type d is the strongest of the four types tested in order to improve experimental design or validity of the results the student could have specified and exact number or weights added to the clam and the kind or weights and exact weight that he was adding to each piece of plastic also he could have measured each piece or plastic exactly the same in order to be more precise
3314,2,3,a based on the students data plastic b is the most stretchability and plastic a is the less stretchable plastic p b in the students' experiment they could of stated exactly what was the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it acceratly for the other plastics they could of also detemen the exact weigh of the clamp and how much wighed the wightes they add to get an more accerated result for the stretchability of the plastics
3315,2,1,the conclusion is there might have been some problems in the student's experiment some validity issuses could be that the five minutes the weights and clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes also the spot were the plastics were placed could not have been the same spot every time
3316,2,2,a a conclusion that can be drawn based on this data is plastic type b has a higher stretchability than the other types of plastics the independent variable is the type of plastic the dependant variable is how far it can be stretched p b the ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to actually name the plastics and to tell us what the actual length was in the beginning by telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better by telling the length of the plastic in the beginning we could see the change that occured
3317,2,2,a the conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics in the data results i found that plastic type b has the most stetchability of the four plastics in both trial 1 and trial 2 p b what were the weight of the weights that were used how long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights
3318,2,3,based on the results plastic a is the least stretchable and plastic b is the most stretchable the students could improve the experiment by giving the exact amount of weight to be used so that the experiment can be redone it needed the student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable
3319,2,1,my hypothesis was correct the second trial didn't stretch the plastics further than the first trial p one way the student could have improved the experiment would be describing the length of the plastics before being stretched second the student could have also allowed the plastics to hang for a longer period of time to gather more accurate results
3320,2,1,based on the following data on the polymer investigation i can make a conclusion that the plastic d type is the most stretchy also the trials very similar but only average by 12 mm because the stretchyness either increased or decreased if a student were to complete this experiment all over again i would suggest that they change the way they set up the experiment because it was very complicated which leads to many errors the students should also test the experiment 2 more times to see a range of results
3321,2,2,the conclusion that i have drawn from this expirament is that plastic type b was able to stretch the most one way the student could have improved this experiment would have been they could have done a third trial to ensure the validity of the plastics' strechability the student also could have been more specific in their procedure they should have specified the plastic type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in their experiment
3322,2,1,a based on the data it seems type is amount stretched is the same the other plastic types stretched differently on both trials p b the students could run more trials to get a good result and they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic and before they put the weights on
3323,2,2,a what the data table shows is that plastic type a and b stretched additional length in trial second trial plastic c stretched length in trial two and d didn't stretch farther in trial two then one p b they can increase the number of trials for those experiment furthermore they should give the exact amount of the weight the use for experiment using grams
3324,2,2,based on this data i can conclude that plastic typ b was the most stretchable at 22mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial one way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3 and another way to improve the validity is instead of timing you should see how much weight it can hold before breaking by adding more weight at intervals
3325,2,3,based on the students data i can examin that plastic type d was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type b stretched farthest two ways the student could improve the experimental design or validity is to create more trials to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measure for each plastic type and trial tested
3326,2,2,according to the data shown plastic type b was the strongest and plastic type a was the least strongest the groups' experimental design would of been positively improved if they include what plastic they were using instead of saying one type of plastic if the group included the original length of the plastic it would of much both their experiment and validity better
3327,2,1,based on the student data it shows that t2 and t1 are showing that most of the experiments change on the second trial and a couple stayed the same as the first trial p the students could have improved their experiment by listing what the type of plastic is on the graph they also showed have wieghed each weight to make sure they are all the same they also could have hung the wights from the same distance on the plastic
3328,2,2,a plastic a stretched out the most with 2 mm b the student could have had another trial to test validity and also have started out with the same length for every plastic
3329,2,2,a based on the table below i can infer that t2 stretched out more than t1 p b two way the student could have impral there exerimanta is is one thy could have gave how long the plastic was befor they stretched it so i can now the amount of the length stretched another thing word have to be is what they taped it the should of have used something more stronger lile another clamp for both end of th plastic and on each end
3330,2,1,the sample of plastic a stretch the least meaning it was the strongest the sample of plastic d stretch the most meaning it was the weakest p the student could have improve the experiment by having a control sample plastic a b c and d with no added weights another way to improve this experiment would be to have more trials for each kind of plastis
3331,2,0,in conclution plastic type a and b did stretch but plastic type c got smaller and plastic type d stayed the same p the student could have found another way to stretch the plastics their data could have been put clearer also
3332,2,0,in conclusion what all of the plastic type a b c d stretched at least a milimeter per trial two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to have a controlled sample for each type plastic before they were stretched and the student should have been more specific about what type of plastic they used
3333,2,0,a conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type d was stretched the most two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to vary the weights and amounts placed on the plastic and to vary the time for the trials
3334,2,3,based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type b is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results would be by including in the procedure the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment also he she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
3335,2,2,a plastic type 'd' had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested p b they should have been more specific about their mass g of the weights used they should have also stated how long their plastic samples were at the beginning of the experiment and how long after they were stretched
3336,2,2,conclusion plastics b d stretch significantly more than plastics a c the students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length they also should named a common value for all the weights
3337,2,3,a that substance b streached the fastest and then d then c and finally a would streatch the least amount p b the student could have given the orginal length of the plastics the student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed
3338,2,3,a from this data it can be concluded that plastic type b is the most flexible because it has the longest length stretched in both trial 1 and 2 additionally plastic type a is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials b one way the experimental design could be improved is by adding more trials for each plastic because more trials lead to more accurate results additionally the design could show how much weight is used on each plastic because if the weights are not the same for each plastic and trial the results are clearly not valid
3339,2,3,in conclusion type a is the strongest plastic and type b is the weakest plastic p in this experiment they should have more trials than just 2 p they also should have put how much weight they used and if it was the same amount of weights
3340,2,2,the conclusion that was drawn was that plastic type a had the longest length after being stretched with weights the students could have improved the experiment by having more than two trials and also by being more specific about the amount of weights that were used
3341,2,2,plastic type d is the most durable it had the most amount stretched the student should have wrote in the measurements of the before stretched length and how many weights to add when stretched
3342,2,3,a based on the results plastie type a was the least flexible while plastic type b was the most flexible p b 1 the student doesn't say where on the table to tape the tap edge of the sample 2 the student uses samples with varying length therefore making his results invalid
3343,2,2,my conclusion is that plastic type b stretch the farthest than the others two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags
3344,2,3,according to the data plastic b seems to have stretched the most while plastic a stretched the least p the experiment could be improved in two ways the plastics' length was not constant and will affect the results the plastics should be a set length the weight of the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure
3345,2,3,a conclusion i can draw based on the start ends data is that plastic type b had stretched the most at the end of both trials also i can draw the conclusion that type a stretched the least after both trials 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials they could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights type of clamp and the height that the plastic hung from
3346,2,2,a one conclusion that can be made is that the strongest plastic is a because it stretched the least in both trials b one way the students could have improved this experiment would have been to also test a control this experiment needs something to compare to or else the results are not totally valid something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure most of the procedure is very vague it would be quite different to try to re perform this experiment with this procedure for example the procedure says add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes the reader does not know the weight or size of the weights her does he know where to put them
3347,2,3,a the conclusion has been drawn that plastic type b stretches the most p b two ways to improve this experiment would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavy the weights should be
3348,2,1,i conclude that plastic type because the strogest because it was the strongest the first and second trail p they could have made none trails and add more weights on the plastic see how had it works
3349,2,2,based on the students data i ca n say that plastic a was the strongest because it barely stretched two ways in which the experimental design validity of the results could have been improved were to label the plastics and in put the length of the plastic before it was stretched
3350,2,3,a plastic type b stretched the most out of all the plastics therefore plastic type b is the weakest p b two ways the students could have improved their experiment is clampy how much weight is put on to the clamps also they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate
3351,2,3,based upon the students data displays that plastic type b is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid
3352,2,3,the plastic that stretched the most was b this student could improve by recordin the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each they could have also added the length of the plastics to show
3353,2,1,the conclusion i can draw from based on the student's data is that a b increased while c decreased and d stayed the same 2 ways the student could have improved the experiment is by 1st the way the decided to do the experiment they should have checked to see if after the 1st trial if it would go back to its normal form 2nd they should have mentioned what the size was before the experiment was started
3354,2,1,plastic d is concictast with how much it stretches state that they are using different plastics state the weight that was added
3355,2,1,i conclude plastic polymer d has the most stretchability and polymer plastic a has the least stretchability the student should have ran two test on each plastic with a brand new piece then averaged the totals together for t1 and t2 for each trial the student also should have set how this piece of plastic is hanging freely that tells me nothing or how to repeat it
3356,2,3,a my conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type b is the most stretchable because for both trials it stretched more than all the other plastic types b two ways the student could have improved the design could be to specify how many weights they added to the clamp and they could of also used something sturdier stronger to hold down the plastic so it wouldn't come off the table
3357,2,2,a based on the student's data plastic b stretched the most by 22 23 mm and plastic a stretched the least with about 11mm plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13 14 mm b the students could have improved the experiment by recording the average amount stretched they also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length
3358,2,3,a plastic type a was mide of the least amount of polymers because it stretched the least and plastic b was the most p b the students could have written the measurements of the plastics before they stretched them and they also could have specified how much weight they held part on the clamps
3359,2,2,a according to the results t2 had stretched the most mm than t1 p b the student should have said how big the clamp should have been and how heavy the weights should have been
3360,2,2,plastic type b stretched the most of all they should have specified the mass of the weights used
3361,2,3,based on the data i can include that plastic b has the most strechability it had the most streching for both the first and second trial 22mm and 23 mm to improve this experiment i would specify how much weight used in each type of plastic and i'd make that a controled variable i would also include the length of the plastic before it was stretched so i can get a better idea on how stretchable the plastic really is
3362,2,3,a based on the data i have seen plastic b seemed to be stretched out the most meaning it's too durable and plastic a seemed to be stretched out the least meaning it's more durable p b one way to improve this experiment is by telling us the amount of weight the student added to the clamp also to get better results the student should've conducted a third trial
3363,2,2,based on the data that is recorded is that they are different here of them had the same length when starting and plastic a stretched the most p this students could improve this experiment by having the four sample all the same length also to could at told us how much the weights should be and should not change
3364,2,2,a plastic type b stretched the furthest with 22 mm on t1 and 23 mm on t2 plastic type a stretched the least with 10mm on t1 and 12mm on t2 p b one way would to have the same starting length for each plastic a second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less
3365,2,2,plastic a was the strongest of the 4 plastics as it stretched the least while plastic d was the weakest as it stretched the most p one way the students could of had a better experiment is to do more trials as it would give more precise data the second way to improve the experiment would be to try the plastics in different conditions such as heat or cold to see if that affects the strength
3366,2,0,well the t2 was higher except for c p the student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again
3367,2,2,a based on the students data it shows that plastic type b is the best choice because it stretched up to 23mm which is farther than the others p b the two ways that they can make the experiment better are adding more trials and adding more controls to make sure that everything is constant
3368,2,1,a when testing our hypothesis whe had came to a conclusion it seems to be that when we tested the plastic type by stretching it we had found out that when stretched a second time the numbers seemed to have went up and then on plastic type d it stood at 20 p b the students could have improved their experimental design if they would have told us what types of plastic they had used also they could have added how many times they did both trials
3369,2,3,plastic b was the most stretchable it stretched 22 mm that and 23mm that 12 plastic a was the least stretchable it only stretched 10mm in trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2 plastic d was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in the first trial and 20mm in the 2nd trial and plastic c was the 3rd stretchest with 14mm in the 1st and 2nd 13mm in the 2nd trial to improve the experiment they could have used the same length of plastic preceding the stretching
3370,2,0,plastic type d stretched the most but on the second trial plastic type a made the most difference to improve this project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more also the student could have put weights in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable
3371,2,2,based on the data plastic b is the most stretchable and plastic a is the least stretchable p the students could have improved their experimental design and validity by attatching the clamp to the same place each time the also should have had a control which woud have been the plastic with the weights
3372,2,1,the plastic that streched the most would be plastic type a because it went from 10 to 12 when the others increased by one or none at all the students could've tested more plastics or use a different method to strech the plastic
3373,2,1,in conclusion according to the results of the experiment on the other hand plastic type a had the least amount of stretchability leaving plastic types c and d somewhere in between them two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be testing each plastic type one or two times for more reliability on the student could have tested more plastic types or added different weights
3374,2,1,a plastic type a had the most resistance it did not rip that much especially compared to plastic type b p b instead of letting them hang for 5 minutes make it less to be more effective
3375,2,0,my conclusion is that plastic type d is best because the amount stretched stayed the same throughout test trial 1 and test trial 2 two ways the students could have improved the experiment is allow the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes and or add a heavier weight
3376,2,1,a some plastics could stretch alot more than others plastic b stretched the most p b the students could added different weights on it and see if that changed the results
3377,2,3,according to the student's data plastic types b seems to be the most stretchable and plastic type a seems to be the most durable i think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount
3378,2,2,a based on the data plastic material a was the most durable out of the four tested this is because plastic a only stretched 10mm on the first trial and 12 on the second while plastic b stretched 22 23mm plastic c 14 and 13 and plastic d 20 each time this means that plastic a tolerated the weight on the clamp the best and also that plastic b tolerated it the least p b the students could have improved their experiment by using a variety of different weights to get a wider range of data and by doing more trials to allow for the most accurate data possible
3379,2,0,i think they should of kept the time the same because on this chart the times are differnt then the original time so deffentally improve by keeping the time same
3380,2,2,a after viewing the data it is clear that type b has the greatest stretchability with 22mm and 23mm compared to type a's 10 mm and 12 mm also type d is the most accurate because 20 mm was reached in both trials p b this student can improve the design by specifying how many of what amount weight he used this will give him more control over the experiment also he should have a control plastic to compare the results of the others to the control should be either stretchable or very durable
3381,2,1,my conclusion is that plastic type is going to be more long because it look as if the student added more weight to it the student could have improve this assignment by stating spicifically how much weight to add to the clamp also this experiment could of been more successful if the student had different type of plastic sample to measure
3382,2,2,conclusion type b of the plastic was the least strong and stetches the most type of was the strongest and only stetched about mm two wats the student could of improve the experimental disen would have more trials and what is the length of the plastic
3383,2,1,the conclusion based on the students data shows that with the same weights but different types of plastic are different the students could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment
3384,2,0,conclusion type d plastic has more stretchability because the a mount stretched is 20 t1 20 t2 on the first step the should be more specific for the type of plastic for the fift step should include in what direction to measure the plastic type after re moving the weights
3385,2,3,in conclusion plastic type b has the most stretchability one way to improve the experimental design is to make sure the same amount of weight is used for each plastic another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial
3386,2,1,a plastic type a was 11mm that had changed the most from trial 1 to trial 2 it had increased by a going from 10 to 12 p b one way the students could ad improved they're experiment is by doing more track another way the students could ad improved there experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags
3387,2,3,a a conclusion that i can draw from the student's data is that plastic type b stretched the most i know this is accurate because during the second trial it come to be about the same p b to ways the student could have improved the experiment are p 1 he she should have added how much each weighed and 2 he she should have put the lengths of the plastics before they were stretched in her data
3388,2,2,considering the plastic was already stretched it wasn't as strong as it should of been on the second trial the student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched he could of also told how heavy the weights were
3389,2,0,the way they could had improved the experimental design or the validity results is by adding more to it to make it higher than it is
3390,2,0,i conclude that all plastic type stretchability is good except d the students could had improved the experimental design by all of the plastic being known in prior knowledge that it would stretch another way would be that they could of see how much of something it could hold
3391,2,2,plastic types and c were stiffer while types b and d stretched more this student could have supposed this experiment by adding a third trial for more accurat data and by adding the original length of each peice of plastic to table that he made the original length would better the understanding of the data by whoever is reading the table because they would be able to see what length the plastic started at
3392,2,1,1 way this student could have improvert this experiment b by doing more trials so their results done out better also they could have hung the weights for a longer period of time
3393,2,2,in conclusion trial any
3394,2,1,the amount of stretched in t1 and t2 nie was a little different t2 was greater than t1 in plastics a b and c but in plastic d they had the same amount of stretched p what the student shoud do to improve his experiment is to add more trials
3395,2,3,based on the results of the experiment plastic type b had the least overall stretch although the groups results are not valid there are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also all of the samples should be exactly the same length
3396,2,2,a plastic b stretched the most out of all therefore plastic b has the greatest level of stretchability p b the studen could have changed the tested variable the 2nd trial or he she could have preformed an additional trial
3397,2,2,to improve the validity of the trial the student could add another trial for each of the plastic strips to improve the experimental design the student should mention the exact amount of the weights used on the plastic
3398,2,3,based on the student's investigation i conclude that plastic types b and d are weaker polymers than plastic types a and c both b and d stretched much farther than a and c which indicates that their polymer chains are not as strong this student could improve the experimental design by using the same length of each sample to ensure that it is not a variable also the student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each sample was stretched by exactly the same forces
3399,2,2,conclusion there was a small difference between the first and second trial for each plastic the student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial they could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed
3400,2,2,plastic b is the stretchiest plastic it stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics p the student could have specified what weight to use so each plastic is being pulled with by the same weight different weights would affect accuracy negatively the student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested for example if a plastic was heated before the test it would stretch much more than a plastic that was cooled lastly the student could make sure each test was in same environment
3401,2,0,b one thing they could've improved on would be the description on the steps explain it more with detail another thing the students could work on would be to define the control p a polymer investigation
3402,2,3,a my conclusion is that plastic b was the stretchiest p b to improve experimental design and validity the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic also there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end also there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid
3403,2,1,the conclusion
3404,2,1,a a conclusion of this procedure would indicate the plastics durbility to a certain amount of weight and which if the plastics is more durable or unstretched than the others p b one way the students could have improved the experimental design would be stating the types of plastic used another way would be by determining how heavy the weights were on the clamps
3405,2,2,in conclusion based on these lab results plastic type b was stretched the farthest where plastic a was stretched the least one thing the student should do to improve their experimental design was list what kind of plastics they were instead of just naming them plastic a plastic b etc also to improve their validity of the experiment they should have done twice trial to make sure that the first type trials were right
3406,2,1,a conclusion of the student's rest of stretchability on polymers is plastic type b is the stretchiest because it stretched out the most out off all the other plastics plastic type a would be the least stretchiest because it stretched out the least out of all the other plastic types 2 ways the students could have improved the results are increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results are increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results the second way is add more weights when stretching out the plastics so you can see how they react under more weight pressure
3407,2,3,according to this data table plastic type b has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type a p b torbe more accurate say how much the weight weighs and that you have been using the same for the same amount of time also make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic
3408,2,0,the type stretched out differently depending on how much weight was put on them
3409,2,1,plastic polymer d has the most stretchability it is more durable two ways the students could have improved the experimental design an validity of the results would be to have a few more trials and test the plastics for 10 minutes
3410,2,1,in conclusion plastic type d based on our data stretched the most and plastic type a stretched the least type d stretched 20 for both trials while type a stretched10 for ti and 12 for t2 two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial also to average the data out
3411,2,1,a a conclusion based on the students data that they found out plastic type b was the best kind of plastic in this experiment and plastic type a was the strongest p b two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to add more trials because 2 isn't enough and to tell us what to measure the length of the plastic with
3412,2,2,a the conclusion i can conclude from the data is that plastic b stretched the farthest in both of the trials p b more trials p add another type of plastic
3413,2,3,a plastic type b has the greatest stretchability it stretched 22 and 23mm in both trials while the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm p b the students could improve this experiment by adding more trials and by measuring mass of the weights
3414,2,3,in this lab a student investigated the stretchability of four different polymer plastics a b c and d after two trials of each polymer the student concluded that plastic type b had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested two ways the student could have improved this experimental design was to make sure the tape that was holding the type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the weight of the clamps and other weights another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down
3415,2,3,a plastic type b was the only polymer plastic that was able to stretch out the most while plastic type a was the only polymer plastic that did not stretch out a lot p b one way that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to state how many weighs to add on the clamp another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials
3416,2,2,a conclusion to be drawn is plastic type b is the most strechy and plastic a is the strongest two ways to improve the experiment would be not say exatly and instant say repeat steps and to keep the length and width of the plastics constant
3417,2,2,a a conclusion that i can draw based on the students data is that plastic b stretches alot more then any of the other plastics and plastic a is the least stretchy i know that because plastic b's lowest trial was trial 1 with 22mm stretched whitch higher than any of the others on the data table also plastic a's highest was in trial 2 at 12mm stretched and that the lowest on the board besides its own t1 as you can see the conclusion i drew and why it is an accurate one b two ways it could have been improved was by doing 3 trials bc the more trials the more accurate the experiment is and you're supposed to do 3 he should have allowed the them to hang for more then 5 minutes in step 4 this way it will have more time to stretch
3418,2,3,based on the student's data the order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is b d c a two ways the students could have improved the experimental design validity of the results would've been to use the same clamp for all the experiments and to use the same amount of weights
3419,2,1,a conclusion i can draw is that plastic type b can be streched the most at 22 mm plastic type a was the weekest stretched at 10 mm p two ways are do a control and do it for a longer time
3420,2,0,both plastic types b and d stretched out of all the plastic types he could have listed all materials first also he could have timed longer
3421,2,2,the purpose for this experiment was to investigate which of four polymer plastics is best in terms of stretchability according to the data table plastic type b is higher regarding stretchability having the most mm's in trial 1 22mm and trial 2 23 mm while the least stretchable is plastic a having 10 mm in trial 1 and 12 mm in trial 2 two way of improving result validity would be by testing not just stretchability but abrasion and other technique 2 increasing the amount of trial for greater data
3422,2,2,according to the data plastic type d was most likely a hard type of plastic such as a water bottle or milk jug because it didn't stretch at all two ways the student could have improved the experiment would be to add the constant of how much weight was added this is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same a second way to improve the experiment is to use the same amount of plastic to make each trial more valid and similar
3423,2,3,plastic type b was the most stretchiest 22 23 plastic type a stretched the least plastic type c a b stretched the second least while plastic type d stretched the second most and was constant with 20mm the students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results more trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't the students also should have clarified how much the weights should weigh when added and when to add them to the clamp
3424,2,1,after reading the recorded data from the investigation i can conclude that out of plastics a b c and d plastic a and b both increased in milemeters opposed to c which decreased after the second trial while plastic d stayed the same during both trials one way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by leaving the the clamps on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes another would be to perform a third trial
3425,2,3,plastic type b is the most stretchable with 22mm and plastic type a is the least stretchy it only stretched 10mm however in order for this experiment to be more valid you would have to keep the amount of weight and the length of each plastic the same if you were to do this then you cold get a more accurate data
3426,2,0,a based on the data i conclude plastic d is the stretchiest type of plastic in both trials the plastic stretched the same amount 20mm p b one way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong another way was to create a graph
3427,2,0,my conclusion from the data is that a streched 2mm b streched 1mm c streched 1mm and d stayed the same at 20mm p name the plastic being used add how much each plastic streched
3428,2,3,based on the students data plastic type b is the stretchiest one way they could have improved their experimental design is by creating a controlled length for each of the plastic types another way they could have improved the validity of the experiment is by adding more trials because by performing more trials flukes will not greatly affect the data
3429,2,2,based on the student's data you can tell that on plastic type a and is continue to expand after they are streched a second time while plastic type c and d do not the student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how more weights they added to the plastic and adding a 3rd trial those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment
3430,2,3,a conclusion based on the table is that plastic type b was the strongest because stretched very much and it did not break two ways the students could have improved the experiment is specify how much weight to add to the plastics and tell us how long the plastic samples should be
3431,2,1,conclusions drawn from this experiment is that plastic type d had stretched the most and is most flexible while plastic type a had stretched the least and is the least flexible the student could have stated what the types of plastic were though so instead of seperating them by letters who'd know exactly what they are he should of also said how heavy the weights would be and made sure they were all kept the same weight
3432,2,1,a the type of plastic that stretched the highest amount of mm was plastic type b with a total of 45 mm the record trial was more than the first trial as shown on the data table p a way that the student could have improved the experimental design could be to stretch the plastic with your hands a second way would be to wait more than five minutes to take the clarops off
3433,2,3,based on the results from the data table the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had a couple longer length so something could have been done differently from the first trial the data should that plastic b stretched the farthest during the first trial and that it is the stretchiest the way the student could have improved the design or validity of the results is to repeat it 2 more trials exactly like before to ensure the results are accurate a second way the student could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to each plastic instead of just saying changed
3434,2,3,a in conclusion plastic b streched the most endeng with a total of 45mm of streched plastic the least effective plastic in strechability was plastic a only streching a total of 22mm b 1 keep the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement 2 measure the plastics making them all the exact same size with specific numbers
3435,2,3,based on the students data i conclude that plastic type b stretched the most after five minutes plastic type a stretched the least the students should of told us how many weights to add to the clamp and how much each weight weighed they also should of told us what type of plastic they were using
3436,2,0,two ways the students could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results is they could be more specific and could of wrote a conclusion saying which plastic type has more stretchability instead of drawing a data table to show how much a the stretchability of each plastic
3437,2,0,based on the student's data plastic b and d stretched almost twice as much as a and c so therefore b and d are most likely made of branched chain polymers whereas a and c are made of linear polymers the student could have improved his or her procedure by clarifying where exactly the plastic were tape on the table in order to keep the data constant if the tape was slightly higher we for some plastic this and have affected the data the student should also clarify where to put the clamp on the plastic for the same reasons
3438,2,1,a plastic type b has the most tensile strength and plastic type a hav the least tensile strength b the student could have added a control and specified how much weights were added
3439,2,2,a based on this data the students can conclude that plastic b is the stretchiest sample p b two ways the students could improve their experiment would be to use a fresh sample for each trial they could also ad the same weight consistantancy for each sample
3440,2,3,the conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest p how much weight to rise p did a third trial
3441,2,2,based on the data table plastic types a b c and d plastic a was the weakest because it stretched 22 mm to 23 mm the student could have made this experimental better if the do more trail and the temperature of the plastic
3442,2,3,plastic type b is the polymer plastic with the highest stretchability because in both trials it had stretched the most this experiment is not very valid because the different polymer plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it stretches also the measure of the weights weren't specified
3443,2,2,a plastic type a was the most streachable of all plastics tested b one way the students could improve the experamental design and validity of the results is if they repeated the test on each plastic several times to ensure their results were correct another way that they could improve the design is if they specified amount of weight added to the clamps then did trials with a different amount of weight
3444,2,2,a if you tape a plastic sample to a table and attach a clamp with weights on the bottom then plastic type c will stretch the longest because it is the thickest out of all the plastics p b two ways the student could improve was to add more trials and make sure to use the same amount of weights for each plastic
3445,2,2,a the plastic that is most stretchable is plastic b and the least stretchable is plastic a p b the student could have put the original length of the plastic into his table without the original length it is actually impossible to see which one stretched the most plastic d looks like it stretched a lot according to the graph but its original length could have been 20 the length of the plastic samples should also be the same if there is one sample that is shorter than the others the results will not be accurate
3446,2,0,a the conclusion to my investigation is at the end of my investigation plastic d came out even in the second trail for t1 and t2 when stretch p b two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by telling us what plastic to use for example plastic bottle or wrap also telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched
3447,2,3,a plastic type a stretched the least out of the others in both trials plastic type is stretches the most in both trials the student did not have a control variable p the student could have measured each plastic before adding weights to make a controll each plastic type had to be the same length could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
3448,2,1,a plastic type b is the most stretchable p b make sure to say what kind of tape is being used scotch tape would be too weak also when saying perform a second trial t2 exactly like the first trial t1 it can't be exactly the same you have to use new samples of each type of plastic a b c d
3449,2,1,based on the experiment's data the plastics a through c stretched up down however plastic type d did not change at all in both trials plastic a's amount of stretching went up by 2 plastic b's stretching amount went up by only one plastic type c also only went up by 1 the students could have improved the experiment by having more tests having a control
3450,2,2,a conclusion for this experiment is that there must have been a possible error somewhere making the data unreliable this is because the results are inconsistant p one way the student could have improve the experiment is to have done more trials another way the student could have improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp
3451,2,2,in this investigation the conclusion is that plastic type b stretched the most in both trials as you can see in the data table plastic type b stretched 22mm in the 1st trial in the second trial plastic type b stretched 23mm plastic type a stretched the least in both trials in the first trial plastic type a stretched 10mm and in the second trial it stretched 12mm two ways that this lab could have been improved would be to wait longer than 5 minutes to have them stretched and to make sure they are the same length
3452,2,1,based on the students data plastic type d stretched the most which means it is probably made of weaker polymers plastic type a stretched the smallest amount which means it is made of the strongest polymers p two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are to measure how thick in width each of the plastic strips were before and after the experiment and to describe the difference in texture if any of each plastic
3453,2,2,a plastic b stretched more than plastics a c d when weights are added to it p 1 how much weight was added 2 what do they measure length in
3454,2,1,a from looking at the data plastic type b in trial one and two seem to be the strongest when weight was added to them p b the students could have improved the experiment by stating what type of plastic they were using for each they also could have been a little more clear on some of their steps
3455,2,2,during this experiment it was proven that plastic sample a was the most durable as it only moved between 10 12mm the most flexible however was plastic sample b it stretched between 22 23mm to improve the validity of this experiment i would reccomend specifying the amount of weight to add to the clamp so that it can remain constant throughout the experiment
3456,2,3,type plastic b stretched the longest in t1 to t2 having measurements of 22 to 23 ways the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights are
3457,2,1,i a conclusion based on the students data is that plastic d streched the same amount at 20mm for trial 1 trial 2 but plastic b streched the most for trials 1 2 at 22mm for trial 1 and 23mm for trial 2
3458,2,1,in conclusion plastic type d was the most strechable streched 20mm and a was the least streched 10mm therefor type d would be the best choice the design could be improved by adding a controlled and by adding the new much the weights were
3459,2,0,a our hypothesis was collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest because it is the most durable p b one way to improve their design was to add more to step seven like repeat steps 1 6 with new pieces of plastic
3460,2,3,a a conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type b is the most stretchable whereas type a is the least and is more resiliant p b two ways to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples the same size before stretching specifying what meraments to go up by in weight added and specific amount of weight to add must be the same
3461,2,3,in the conclusion of the experiment plastic type b stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm while i thought plastic type a streched the least 10 12 mm two ways that these students can improve their experimental design would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight to put on to the clamps also the students got include the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data
3462,2,1,a my conclusion in this experiment would be that plastic type b has the most stretchability out of all the polymers tested in both trials it had the most amount stretched trial 1 it was stretched 22mm and trial 2 was stretched 23mm b the student could have improved the experimental design in two ways by having a control and by including constant variables the control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the data and constant variables would have made it so no other variables were affecting the results of the experiments
3463,2,3,i can conclude that plastic type b is the stretchiest because it stretched to 22 and 23mm p the student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge the student could also say how much weight he was using
3464,2,3,in conclusion plastic type b has the highest stretchability while type a has the lowest one way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to have a specific weight such as 1 1b 2 1b 3 1b another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results
3465,2,2,one conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type b stretched the most 22 mm and 23 mm out of all the plastics also plastic type a stretched the least only stretching to 10 mm and 12 mm this is a conclusion that can be drawn p to improve the validity of the experiment the students could name the four plastics used also to have accurate data the kids should have set a measurement at which to cut all the plastics instead of saying ''measure its length'' also adding a control would be helpful as well this is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment
3466,2,1,a conclusion that can be drawn from these student data could be that plastic type d appears to be the most reliable or stretchs the most two ways these students could have improved their design is they could have done more trials and also they could have kept adding weights and see where plastic broke first and which held out the longest could have been the strongest
3467,2,1,my conclusion about the students data would be the farthest amount stretched he recorded one thing i would have done would be to change the plastic to which is more durable and add t3 so their can be more results
3468,2,1,a based on the data plastic type b stretched the most during trial 1 and trial 2 the least stretchable plastic was plastic type a type c was not very stretchable and plastic d was the second most flexible p to ensure accuracy of the experiment p the student could have revealed the weight added to each plastic in the table to make sure that it was constant and also could have measured after a longer amount of time
3469,2,1,a based on the students data and the 2 trials the experiment seems to be very valid and accurate p b one way to improve this experiment i believe would be a third trial run only because plastic type a was 2mm away from the first trial which doesn't give you a great conclusion and another way i would change this would be explain better its very confusing and not specific how much were the weights etc
3470,2,2,if i look four plastic cups and taped them from the side of the table and place different contents such as weights then the plastic cups will stretch based on my results my hypothesis was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 shows that the plastic cups had stretched for example plastic type a stretched 10mm in trial1 after adding weights to the clamp and letting it hang for five minutes they could have improved the this experiment by giving the length of the cup before the cup and then they could have just measured it again and see what it was after for example before 30 after 40 they also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment
3471,2,2,based on the students data you can conclude that plastic b was the stretchiest of all the plastics if the students are to conduct the experiment again they could improve their experimental design by using heavier weights and also doing more trials
3472,2,2,in conclusion to this data i think plastic type b is the most flexible type of plastic also plastic type a is the least flexible p the students can improve their experiment by explaining how much of each plastic they should measure for example step 1 should say take 5cm of one plastic type also they could improve it by adding the weight of the clamp and letting it sit for longer than 5 minutes
3473,2,1,after looking at the data i can conclude that plastic was d was the stronger the plastic because it stayed the same length p b two ways they could have improved the job is by first stating what type of plastic you are using and by saying how much weight you have to the clamp
3474,2,3,a from viewing data from me polymer investigation it shows that plastic type b truly has the most stretchability because it stretched the most out of all the polymers at average of 22 5 mm p b the experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3 then the accuracy would go up another thing that you could have done was specified how much weight your adding and if its the same amount for all plastics
3475,2,1,i conclude that plastic type d didn't stretch all all because the mm length hasn't changed one way they could have improved the experiment is by telling us kind of plastic they used another way is that they could have told us how heavy the weights were that they were using
3476,2,0,in the conclusion the plastic strech out longest in t2 the t1 p the way they could of make there expriment better is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty
3477,2,2,according to the students data plastic type b is the strongest two ways the student could have improved the experiment design validity of the results were by stating the length and type of each plastic the student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic another thing the student should have done is stated how much weight to hang off of each strip of plastic and if it was the same each time
3478,2,2,a conclusion i draw based on their data is that plastic type d is the most durable and strongest plastic it didn't change in either trial an improvement the students could have done made was recording the original lengths of the plastics before it went through the test also they could have recorded the amount of weight they added to the clamp in order to see what caused the plastics to stretched validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang
3479,2,3,according to the students data type b polymer plastic stretched the furthest the students could have improved this experiment by adding more trials and more sure that in step 2 that all the plastic samples were changing freely down the side of the table evenly by measuring the parts taped
3480,2,0,the weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic
3481,2,0,the student used different plastic to determine its stretchability she took a sample of one of the plastic measured she added weights on the plastic to see how far it would on
3482,2,3,a plastic b is more stretchable than plastic a c and d the student didn't mess up anywhere during the expierement otherwise there would be a bigger gape on the strecbility between two trials p b the student should use the same amount of weights for each plastic and should have done a third trial
3483,2,3,a a conclusion i could come up with in this experiment is that plastic type b has stretched 22 23mm which makes it the most stretched but out of the 4 they tested in both trials while plastic type a had the least stretchability at 10 12mm b two ways the students could have improved this experiment is they should have done at least 3 or more trials to better the information given they also should have made sure in step 2 that each plastic was hanging off the table at the same length so it would be a fair way to measure at the end
3484,2,1,plastic type b has the most stretchability during both trials plastic type a had the least amount of stretchability in both trials the student could have explained how the plastic stayed on the table if there were weights attached also what kind of table the experiment took place on
3485,2,1,based on the student's data both plastics type a and b has increased in t2 type c has dicreased in t2 and type d stayed the same p two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is add more control and make more trials
3486,2,2,in conclusion scene within the data toble plastic type b was most durable in being stretched making plastic b have the most stretchability this expirement could of been improved by having a control of how far each plastic could be streached with out weights secondly they could have told us in the ditecting and in use smaller weight or larger weights and actual length sizes so the expirerment could be done right
3487,2,1,one way the student could have imomised the experiment is to try the trials more than once
3488,2,2,a based on the exploits data plastic type a stretched the farthest from trial 1 to trial 2 and plastic type b shrinkid from
3489,2,3,plastic
3490,2,2,a plastic type b stretched the furthest out of the grap p b give the specific name of the plastics used tell us what size weights to use
3491,2,3,a conclusion is that plastic type a is the strongest plastic because once the weight was taken off the plastic didn't stretch that much p p a way they could have improved there experiment is that they could have said how heavier the weights were also they could have made each plastic the same length before adding weights
3492,2,2,a based on the data plastic d had the greatest stretchability with an over age of 20mm streched this was much greater than plastic a which had the lowest average amount stretched which was 11mm plastic b and c tell in the middle p b one way the students could have improved the experiment design would to specify the amount of weights used and make sure it was the same each time the students should also specified how to hang the plastics off the table so that the same amount was on the table as was hanging off
3493,2,1,based on the students data i can conclude that the second time the trial was done the amount that the plastic types stretched was greater than that of trial one except for type c which it shrink 1mm from 14 to 13 in trial 2 two ways they could have made this experiment better is if they were specific on how much weight was used and if in the chart they included the amount of time that each plastic type hong
3494,2,1,the first thing the students should improve the experiment design is instead of attaching clamps to the bottom of the plastic sample they should use small boots to it then the second thing they should is do more trials to the experiment because they probaly won't be happy with the data they already got so i would say do more trials and they might get better results
3495,2,0,a conclusion based on the data is that all the plastic types have ranged around the same number two ways the experiment could have been approved is for the different plastic types let the weight hold longer than five minutes and change the trials
3496,2,3,a plastic b stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity stretchability plastic a was the least stretchy these results were most likely due to the combination of polymers in each plastic controlling their physical attributes p b one way the student could have improved the experimental design originally is by stating how long the plastic should be cut to be so 25 to make the experiment uniform he should have increased this in his table so people could see how the lengths changed then he should have specified how much weight to add to the clamps for consistency
3497,2,3,a a conclusion to the experiment could be that plastic type b was able to be stretched the most 22mm 23mm when compared to the stretchability of the after three plastics p b one way the students could have improved the experiment would be to add in the conclusion the amount of weight they add up to each tag they could have improved validity by adding another trial
3498,2,2,from the students data you can tell that plastic type a has the best stretchability plastic type b and c were the second best stretchability also that type d hold no sort of stretchability but could have tried more times to yield better results or they could have told us how much weight did they put on for each clamp for each plastic
3499,2,3,my experiment concludes that out of the four plastic polymers plastic type b was the stretchiest while plastic type a was the least stretchy my hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch was correct because i know that plastic type b immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types the students could have improved their experiment by using a constant length for the plastic and using a contrast weight to stretch it with
3500,2,2,a the conclusion is that the plastic type b in the second trial stretched the most to 25mm p b the could have added a third trial and control variables
3501,2,2,looking at the student's data you can see that plastic type b has the best stretchability the bag stretched 22 and 23 mm that is more than any other bag in the two trials the students could have done one more trial to justify their results also they could have used a different amount of weight
3502,2,1,after testing four different polymere plastics plastic type a b c d for their stretchability based on the data table plastic type a stretched 10mm 11 and 12 mm t2 plastic b stretched 22mm t1 and 23mm t2 plastic c stretched 14 mm 11 and 13mm t2 and plastic d stretched 20 mm 11and 20 mm t2 showig me that plastic b has the most stretchability and plastic a has the least two ways the student could have improved the experiment was including a control to have something to compare the stretchability of the plastics to and state what each plastic was
3503,2,3,a my hypothesis that plastic type b would stretch the most was correct b stretched on average 22 5 mm while the other three ranged from 10 20mm if i need a plastic with the largest stretchability i would choose b p b the experiment would be more valid if i started with the same amount of each substance before doing the trials and it would also be more valid if i complete one or two more trials
3504,2,1,plastic b is the most stredechable and a is the least stredachable p they should vary the weights they had on this elome and also allow them to hens for longer
3505,2,3,a according to the students data the conclusion i can draw is that plastic b had the most strechability it stretched 22 mm in trial one and 2mm in trial two second was plastic d it's strechability was 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic a with 10 in trial one and 12 in trial 2 b could have done more trials to compare data to and make trials to compare data to and make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same size
3506,2,2,based on the students data the plastic a streched the least and the plastic type b streached the most something that could have the experiment better is count how many weights are placed on the clamp this experiment is not valid because the number of weights isn't given another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not
3507,2,0,a with the student's data you can tell that trials aren't that much different in the amount stretched p b two ways the student could have improved the results was add less weight another thing is let it hang longer
3508,2,2,the students could conclude that plastic b has the most stretchability because it stretched the farthest distance every time the experiment could have been improved by making all the original pieces of plastic the same length also they could have used a control for comparison
3509,2,3,it has come to my conclusion that plastic letter b is the strongest plastic b showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most p b first i would have don 3 trial because that always renders a more exccurat result than 2 second i would mak sure all the plastics war the same length
3510,2,2,a each trial was very close to the same answer as the other one so it poves my validity and shows that the weights does stretch out the plastic p b the student needs to say how long the plastic was before the experiments he should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere
3511,2,2,according to the students data the conclusion that plastic type a stretched the most the student could of improved the experiment by making sure that all the plastics were the same length another way he she could of improved the experiment is by doing is third trial t3 every experiment that is being investigated should have a third trail t3 in order to get the correct results
3512,2,1,plastic types b and d stretched significantly father than a and c this allows us to infer they have weaker bonds making them more succeptible to stretching one way the data would have been to write down the initial length of the plastic also record the initial weight this way we have more information to base our conclusion off of
3513,2,0,a when the experiment was finnish the data showed that the four different polymer plastics for stretchability didn't have different results the amount the four plastic types stretched in test one and test two were almost the same p b two differnt ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity would of bein adding time for the weight to work
3514,2,1,the students data shows that plastic type b hold the most weight and that plastic type a held the least i think that the student would have added more trials and recorded the average of the trials he also should have waited until the plastic bioler to record the data instead of waiting for it to get to a certain length another thing that could have been done is use less time the student waited five minute before adding another weight when they could have just added until the plastic ripped
3515,2,2,a the student can conclude that plastic type b stretches the most and plastic type b stretches the most and plastic type a stretches the least p b the student could have stated what exactly he was looking for he could have also added another trial to see a better average because some of them were close
3516,2,2,based on the student's data it's safe to say that plastic sample a was the strongest you can see this because in the chart the plastic was the smallest one thing the student could've improved was if all the plastic samples were the same size this way all the pieces of plastic have the same starting point another thing the studend could change is taking two samples of each plastic so you weren't testing the same sample twice
3517,2,3,a from the information in the data table i can conclude that plastic type b stretched the greatest considering that 22 and23 mm is the highest number compared to the rest p b two ways the students could have improved the design are measuring the length of plastic before the trials and doing one more extra trial to check validity
3518,2,2,out of both trials plastic type b got the longest after experiment it streched out to 22mm in trial a and 23mm in trial b plastic type a stretched out the least in trial a it reached 10mm and in trial b it reached to 12mm p two ways the students could have improved the validity of their results would be to add in the original lengths of the plastics in their data table they could of also gave the names of the plastics instead of using letters
3519,2,1,well in this data i can conclude that the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the second trial but plastic d stood the same which was at 20 p the student could have made this experiment better by telling us what type of plastics they used also they could have said how much the weights weighed
3520,2,1,a plastic type d stretched the most and a stretched the least p b they could have done a 3rd trial they could explain what brand of plastic each type was
3521,2,1,a based on the data from the experiment the plastics that bell's the most was plastic b in the first trial it expanded 22 min 23 min in the second trial b this experiment is belong a control and needs more trials to improve the validity
3522,2,0,plastic type a had the most impact on stretching type b and c only stretch out one mm longer type a was the same p the student could have added more plastic types and let the weights clamps hang for a longer time
3523,2,2,we can conclude that plastic b is the plastic that can stretch the most we can also conclude that plastic a can stretch the least the student should haw used the same length plastic for each the student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length and ending length
3524,2,1,based on the students data i can draw a conclusion that at the end of expirment plastic type a stretched the longest with 2mm and type d stretched the least by remaining the same at 20mm two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is first tell how much the weights weighed that he added to the clamp another way the experimental design could have been improved is by telling what kinds of plastic instead of using type a b c and d
3525,2,2,a it is concluded that plastic type a had the most streachability because it increased 2mm in length from being streched and all the others either grew smaller or barely streched p b two ways this student could have improved the experimental design would be to have all the plastics begining length the same and also specify how much weight to add to the plastic samples
3526,2,2,a based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type b had the highest amount of plastic stretched compared to the other p b two ways students could of improved this experiment is by dding materials to make results more reliable also they should of had a control veriable of just the plastic so you can see the results on how far it has stretched
3527,2,3,based on the data collected by the experiment plastic type b has the greatest stretchability when attatched to weights however there are ways in which this experiment could be improved the student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp he she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts also a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length only 2 measurements is not clear a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic making the numbers more simple to process
3528,2,3,plastic type b has more stretchability then plastics a c or d plastic b stretched on average of 22 5mm whereas a averaged it c averaged 13 5 and d averaged 20 the students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time the students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length
3529,2,2,a a conclusion based on the student's data is that between each trail the number stayed the same or increased decreased by one p p b two ways the experiment could have improved is for the validity is to write down the mm it started at and another way is to make sure when adding the weights they are the same found for each trail plastic type
3530,2,2,according to the data plastic type b had the most stretchability of all them and plastic type a stretched the least each trial the students could've said what type of plastic it was and also stated the before and after numbers for the plastic just in case there were any errors in the experiment
3531,2,3,based on these results i can conclude that plastic b has the most stretchability these results are valid because of the two trials so i can confidently conclude this to improve the validity even more would be to use the same length plastic for each type because this may affect the results also the should give a specific weight to add on the procedure instead of just saying add weights
3532,2,2,the conclusion of this experiments that plastic b is the stretchiest with 22 and 23mm stretched in the two trials an average of 22 5mm plastic a was the least stretchy with 10 and 12 mm stretched in the two trials an average of 11mm the student could have improved the experiment by performong on trial 3 t3 for the plastics to ensure validity another way could be to let the weights hang even longer or add more weights to each plastic to ensure validity
3533,2,2,a based on the data table the polymer plastic with the most stretchability is plastic type b because it was stretched out the furthest then the next most stretchy was d then c then the least was a p b two ways to improve the experimental design or validity of the results are be more specific how much weight is being added to the plastics and for t2 i believe that a different amount of weight should be added to the plastic types
3534,2,0,in conclusion plastic a is the strongest and plastic d is the weakest p the student could improve the validity of the results by 1 saying in t1 t2 they used 2 different sets of 4 kinds of plastics and 2 you can also have at least one other person there to varify this
3535,2,1,a from this data you can conclude that there really wasnt much of a change and that t1 bag is stronger p b the student need an control and also need to be more spcific when it comes to the weights
3536,2,3,plastic sample b stretched the farthest p the experiment could have been improved by adding exact amount of what to be added on the plastics also to measure how much of the plastics edge to be taped to the table so they are standing at the same point
3537,2,1,repeat the procedure and use more examples
3538,2,0,to draw a conclusion i would figure out the patium to this data table b two way i think the students could of improved on this data table would be to take step eight make sure they're right
3539,2,2,1 based on the students data it is conclusive that plastic sample a is the strongest plastic because in trial one it's length was 10mm and in trial 2 it's length was 12mm plastic b is the weakest plastic because it's length after weights were added was 22mm andon the second trial was 23mm p b the students could have improved the experiment by increasing the time from 5mins to 10mins and increasing the number of trials with each samples
3540,2,2,the conclusion i drew from the data is that plastics b and d most likely have less rigid polymer structous than a and c the students could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and including the exact weight of the weights to use i think the experiment is pretty valid because there are no obvious errors but the students could increase the validity by doing more trials
3541,2,2,based on the students results the polymer plastic that was able to stretch the most was plastic b this student could have improved the validity of the results by finding out the averages of how far each plastic was able to stretch he could have also noted in his procedure that all the weights most weigh the same so it could be constant these changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid
3542,2,1,based on the data plastic type b is the most stretchable polymer p the student could have improved validity by reducing the time in each trial using less weight
3543,2,3,based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type b was the most strechable of the four plastics because in t1 it streched 22 mm and in t2 it streched 23 mm one ways the student could have improved the validity of their results would be to do more trials one way they could have improved the experimental design would be by specifying the amount of weights to place on the clamps in step 4
3544,2,3,a the strechiest polymer plastic tested was type b followed by type c then type a being the least stretchiest p b the student could have improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weights
3545,2,2,based on the students data plastic type b was stretched the most plastic type a was stretched the last i think two ways that could have made this lab better is that all the plastic types should all have to be the same length before you add the weights to them and second the procedure should tell you to record that data on a chat the the student did
3546,2,0,a they should remain the same p b they should take out the weights p c they should work together on the project
3547,2,2,two ways the student could haved improved the experiment one is todo more trials another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes p the conclusion on for experiment is that plastic type b is the weakest because it streched the most and plastic a is the strongest
3548,2,3,a plastic type b has the most strechability because it streched to 22 and 23mm for both trials plastics a c and d only reached maximum lengths of 12 13 or 20mm for both trials p b the students could have improved their experimental design and or validity by adding more trials or by ensuring that the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table
3549,2,1,plastic type a stretched from 10to 12 increased 2 plastic type b stretched from 22 to 23 increased 1 plastic c stretched from 14 to 13 decreased 1 plastic type d stayed the same p the student could have improved the experiemental design by performing diffrent trials
3550,2,2,it seems that plastic type b is the best the reason why it was the best was becuse when it stretched it stretched for the longest two chuges i would mark would be more trials and more test plastics
3551,2,1,the conclusion is that the plastic b is the largest one in trial 1 in trial 2 30 plastic b is the longest plastics out of all of the plastic style the two ways to make experiment would be adding more trials and also having the plastic weights hang for a longer time
3552,2,2,a plastic type b had the most amount of stretch compared to the others p b the student should have specified the length because without a starting length his data is inconclusive the student also should have specified to hold up or attach the clamp to something so the ends would be equal in his procedure it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely
3553,2,1,a the conclusion is that plastic type b had the most amount stretched in both trails and plastic type a had the least amount stretched in both trails p b one way the students could have improved their experiment would have to be tell what type of plastic they use and another one would be to tell how long they stretched each plastic
3554,2,1,a plastic type a increased the more from the first trial to the second trial it went from 10mm to 12mm type c was the only type of plastic that decreased the length type d stayed the same at 20mm of length p b the student could of had a control group which could of been a different type of plastic also the student could of had a third trial to see how it would change the amount the plastic was stretched from the first and second trials
3555,2,2,a my conclusion is if you add more weight the length of the polymers would grow after 5 minutes p b they can improve by doing more trials and by listing different polymers they were using also they can list wht type of weights they were using and how heavy those weights are
3556,2,2,a in conclusion plastic type b could stretch the most p the students could improve their experiment by more trials and by stretching the plastic more
3557,2,1,based on the student's data i conclude that for the second trial the plastic seem to have stretched slightly more than in the first trial also for plastic type d the plastic length stayed the same meaning that it will not stretch any further p b two different ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding more trials and more types of plastic to test
3558,2,0,my conclusion is that they did a pretty good job setting up the data table they not only tried it once they tried it twice one way they could of done a better job by instead of the data table they shouldn't did a bar graph
3559,2,1,a i concluded that the stretchability of the plastics have no real difference because the stretchability of the plastics only very by 1 to 2 millimeters p b two ways the students could have improve the experiment is they could have added a specific amount of weight and they could have let the weights strecth the plastics for a longer period of time
3560,2,0,extend the time of the weight longer like about 10 minutes more use different materials
3561,2,1,the conclusion based on the student data is that plastic type d is the least stretchable and type a is the most stretchable p to improve the experiment the students should have add more trials and also tested different amounts of weights so they could see how each plastic type reached when even more weight was put on
3562,2,2,it would appear from the data that plastic type b is the most stretch able of all the tested plastics it stretched on average 2 5 more than the next stretches plastics one way to improve is say what weight they will apply to each plastics for example 10g 50g 100g another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics
3563,2,1,a a conclusion that can be made for this experiment is in conclusion plastic d would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data table in both trials plastic d did not stretch p b two ways this student could have improved these experiment is by telling us the four different types of plastics used also by telling us how much weight it took to make the plastic stretch and what it is measured in
3564,2,1,plastic a and d were able to withstand the most weights while b and c were the least the students could have improved by using a control and doing more trials for more accurate test results
3565,2,2,a the purpose of this lab is to test 4 different types of polymers to see which polymer is the stretchiest based on the results founded it can be concluded that plastic type b was the stretchiest in both trial one and trial 2 plastic b stretched the most with 22mm in ti and 23mm in t2 plastic type a was the least stretchable with t1 and 12mm in t2 p b one way the lab could be improved would to have specified an exact width to use in the test another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time this should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time
3566,2,1,based on the student's data i concluded that the amount each plastic stretch had varied very little between trials p two ways the students could have improved their experiments would be 1 they could have recorded the plastic samples lengths before they stretched them 2 they could have and all the original samples to the same length the started them
3567,2,1,i would say that plastic type b is the most stretchable type of plastic because in test 1 and 2 it doubled plastic types a and c
3568,2,2,a plastic a stretched the least of all pour other plastics therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched less p b one way the student could have improved their experiment is when repeating their experiment start with a new piece pf plastic other ways they can improve their experiment is by adding the same amount of weights at each type every weight they add should be the same
3569,2,1,my conclusion is that everytime you put weights on it it would stretch to a greater length the ways i would improve it is to tell what kind of plastic is most recommended and what is the best length to use
3570,2,2,a conclusion would be plastic type a is the lested stretched with 10 t1mm and 12 t2mm also plastic type b had the most stretchability at 22 t1mm 23m t2 and type c d were c 14 t1mm 13 t2mm d 20t1mm 20 t2mm two ways the students could hae improvd was to hae a control with no weights on it to improe and compare data also use the same amont of weights for each plastic to keep data acorte
3571,2,3,the conclusion for this experiments is the plastic the trials the most stretchable in trial 1 the amount stretched was 22mm in trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm ways the students could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results is to include the length before it was stretched and keep the amount of heights constants
3572,2,2,a based on the students data the conclusion i draw was that plastic b had the greatest stretchability p b one way that this student could have improved this experiment is to add more trials to have more data to trials conclusions with another way the student could have improved the experiment was
3573,2,1,a i conclude that plastic type b has the best stretchability and plastic type a has the worst type b had 23 and 22 while type d had 10 and 12 mm stretchest p b the students could improve their experiment if they recorded how many clamps they added before the plastic brake the students also could have recorded the time the plastic brake at
3574,2,3,a polymer plastic b s the stretchiest polymer plastic p b the student can verify that the lengths of all the plastics are the same at the begining of the experiment to keep samples constant and he can verify the weights of the weights and clamps to keep variables constant as well
3575,2,1,a the conclusion would be that the procedure of this students data had went as planned all of the results all were around the same number and some were the same p b two ways the student could have improved on this experiment is to have a control group and also they could of had a third trial to make sure that the results were all correct
3576,2,2,the west flexible type of plastic was type b on the first trial type b stretched 22 mm while type a hand the least flexibility by only streching 10mm also type d was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial 2 one way that yje students could've improved the expirement deating was by saying how much weight to put on the plastic their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch
3577,2,0,a from looking at the student's data from their experiment trial 2 had better results than trial 1 in trial 2 they could have done the producure more like the instructions tell them to instead of doing half p b i do not see anything that they couldhave done differently
3578,2,2,a plastic type a has the highest level of stretchability because from the 1st and the second trial it stretched 2 mm while the other plastic types only stretched 1 mm or stayed the same p b two ways the student could improved the experiment could have been to add more weights to the bags another way to improve the validity of the results is to specify how heavy the weights were and how many did he put
3579,2,2,plastic type a stretched the least only 10 12mm thus making it the strongest while plastic type b stretched the most 22 23mm thus making it the weakest could have let the weights hang there for more than 5 minutes to increase validity and had more trials to increase validity
3580,2,1,a according to the conclusion plastic type a length stretch more than the rest of the plastics plastic a is the most stretchy p b the student could had added more trials and a can and groups
3581,2,3,from the student's experiment i can conclude that plastic type b was able to stretch the most while plastic type a stretched the least however these students need to improve their experimental design two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly this would definitely improve the validity of their results
3582,2,2,plastic type b is the strongest plastic to use it was the strongest for both trial 1 and for trial 2 the student could have done one more trial to make the information a little more valid also the students could have let the weights hang longer than 5 minutes
3583,2,1,a plastic d stretched the same lenght in both that but plastic type a is the stretchrest b they could have done more thats and the should have use different weights for more results
3584,2,2,plastic type b streched the most in t1 it strech 22mm and in t2 it streched 23mm plastic type b streched the same length in t1 and t2 20mm type c streched 14mm in t1 but in t2 strech only 13mm type a stretched the lease in t1 it streched 10mm and in t2 it streched in 12mm the students can add more more time for the weights to hang the students can also add a third trial to see witch if type c will remain to strengh and less
3585,2,1,a based on the data given in the second trial the plastics stretched more than the first also plastic type b and d stretched the most in both trials p b two ways the student could have improved their experimental design would be more specific with the procedure and try more trials to average out the results
3586,2,2,a in conclusion plastic type b was the strongest because it stretched the longest plastic a stretched 10 mm and 12 mm plastic b 22 mm and 23 mm and plastic c 14 mm and 15 mm and plastic d 20 mm and 20 mm this data states that plastic b was the strongest b one way he could have improved the experiment is by having all the plastic equal in size and also he could have added the same amount of weight
3587,2,0,trial d has better performed better
3588,2,1,a in contend the data recorded shows that plastic type d stretched the same amount in each trial p b the students could have done a third trial they could have also had the weight and clamp hang for a longer time
3589,2,0,my conclasion is that t 2 had a better amount stretched than t 1 had also t2 had more plastic types than t1
3590,2,3,plastic type b stretches the farthest the students could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and by specifying how much weight to add to the clamp
3591,2,0,a plastic type d is the p
3592,2,1,my conclusion for this experiment is that if plastic b is used than it will be able to stretch the longest and hold the most amount of weights the reason i know this is because in trial 1 and 2 it had the leading length a way that this experiment could have been improved would be by not putting the weights on at the same time this would allow for the bags to get use to each weight another thing could be to make sure all the plastics are equal in measurement because that can ruin the data
3593,2,0,a repeating the experiment t2's measurement increased successful than t1 by not changing the variable and repeating the experiment eight time shows how the wight of the weights affe3cted throughly p b the students could improve the experiment design by increasing the weight or the weights and using different types which usually be the dependent variable
3594,2,2,as a conclusion based on the data plastic type b was the more stretchable plastic in trial 1 plastic type b stretched 22mm in trial 2 plastic type stretched 23 mm therefore plastic type b has a high stretchability level b two different ways the student could have improved p 1 the student could have stated how much the weights weighed and how many to make the experiment more vigor p 2 the student could have indicate the trial high because some bags take longer to stretch or and break
3595,2,2,a my conclusion is that polymer plastic b had the most stretchability p b two ways the experiment could have been improved would be p 1 allow the bags to stretch until they break and record the maximum length each stretched to p 2 the students could have specified the weights used
3596,2,1,according to the students data i would conclude that plastic b was the most stretchy compared to the other 3 plastics the students could of added the weights in the same exact order and made sure she measured in the same measurements
3597,2,2,a i conclude that plastic type b stretched the most because in the trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm plastic type a stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm in the first and 12mm in the second trial p b the students could have improved their experiment in several ways first off that could have identified a specific amount of weight to add on to the clamp they could have also included a control
3598,2,2,a one conclusion i observed based on the student's data is that plastic type b is the most stretchable of the 4 p b two ways the experimental design could have been improved are if 1 the student described the amount of weight putting the bags and 2 the student could have done the trials again using more time
3599,2,3,a in conclusion the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic b p b two ways that the student could of improved his or her investigation is by saying how many weights will they student put and how much does it weigh also describe how long the plastic types were before she started her experiment
3600,2,0,a my conclusion is that the second trial went better than the first because the numbers are much larger than the first p b the first way is the students could have been more specific on what they did and the seeena way is they should have said what types of plastics and tapes they was using
3601,2,1,a trial 2 was the one with the most stretchability trial 1 was around the trial 2's numbers but trial 2 was a ting but tiger or stayed the same plastic c actilly decreased one p b they should have tryedengce plastic more trials to see it most would increase or decrease
3602,2,3,a in conclusion some of the plastics stretched more than others however all of them did stretch polymer a stretched the least and polymer b stretched the most from the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch p the student needs to specify how much weight is added and what the starting and ending measurement of each plastic were
3603,2,0,the conclusion of this lab shows that in the first trial the plastic was stretched 2mm trial two it was stretched 1mm supprisingly in the third trial it actually got smaller by 1mm also the last trial it stayed the same length two improvements could have been how the students should have made the weights heavier and should have made a clearer data table
3604,2,1,the students can conclude plastic type a is least stretchable and plastic type b is the most stretchable and will be less likely to break the students could have improved the experimental design by telling us what they originially measured the plastic in ft cm in e t c told us how many weights and how much they weighed and the type of tape that tapped the plastic in the table
3605,2,0,the conclusion based on the student's data is that with trial1 and with trial 2 there were some changes happen the amount of plastic stretched more the second trial than the first two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is in what minute did the stretch begin and what plastic was the strongest
3606,2,2,based on the data it can be concluded that plastic a is the least stretchable and plastic b is the most plastic a stretched 10mm and 12mm in both trials which was the smallest length plastic b stretched 22mm and 23mm which was the largest length after five minutes the students could have improved their experiment and their results by using plastic samples of the same length and by allowing the plastic to stretch for a longer period of time
3607,2,1,plastic a was obviously the most susceptials to stretching because it stretche 2 inches while plastic b only stretched 1 plastic d did not stretch at all and plastic c lost an inch this experiment would be more valid if the procedure said how much weight to add to the plastic so that it was known what it takes to stretch it and how the plastic was being measured although the data table says that the procedure does not
3608,2,0,the conclusion i have drawn is that plastic type d both trials stretched the same amount also that t2 was better two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results is by compairing their trials to different plastics and collecting that data
3609,2,2,a based on the students data plastic type b had more stretchability than the others p b the student could have done more trials or added on more time for the plastics to stretch longer
3610,2,3,a plastic type b was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time p b the way the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the results also in their procedure they could of said to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same length
3611,2,3,plastic b proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics due to it stretching 22mm on the first trial and 23 mm on the second trial its average amount stretched to 22 5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic p one way they could have improved the design of the experiment is by making sure all the plastics used had the same initial length also to tell how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to reconduct the experiment to do more trials
3612,2,0,a the plastic that stretched was b t2 and the least was a t1 p b the way the student could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the edge of the plastic sample to a table well they should of left putting weight on th plastic to see how much it holds
3613,2,3,a based on the students data i can draw the conclusion that plastic type b had the most stretchability if you you reter back to the graph in trial 1 plastic b was 22 and in trial 2 it was 23 which was more than any of the other plastics b one way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial they could also have told you how long the type of plastic was to regin with in the first place therefore increasing the validity and accuracey of the experment
3614,2,1,student will wrap up an conclusion after plastic type the amount it strech is done the whole experiment was based on how far each plastic streched and which one streched the first and also the one whiched streched the least p they could have improved it by streching each plastic three seperate trial and the answer would have been more clear
3615,2,1,two ways that the students could have improved the expirement design or validity of the results is by increasing the amount of times they stretched the plastic and the plastic type could get changed
3616,2,0,a plastic b seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched 22mm in t2 it stretched 23mm and the least durable seemed to be plastic a because in t1 only stretched 10mm and in t2 it stretched 12mm b they could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched
3617,2,2,a from the data i am able to conclude that plastic type b is the most durable its length stretched to be 22 and 23 this show that it was able to hold the heaviest amount of weights b one way the student could improve the experimental design is by using same weights for each plastic also the student should use the same measuring just so they can be reassured that the length of the plastic is accurate for each of the 4 plastics
3618,2,1,the conclusion is that the plastic did stretched out but some stayed the same length and other decreased p the student would have improved is by having a control group by doing it by a certain weight and other put more weight see if there any difference in ti stretchability
3619,2,0,of the four types of plastic a and c stretched about the same amount of weight and d stretched about the same amount the first way they could improve the experiment would be to test different amounts of weight they should also only measure what hangs over the table both times for a more precise result
3620,2,3,a to conclude plastic type b is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics type b stretched 22 mm on t1 and 23 mm on t2 average of 22 5 mm while type a and c ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm and type d 20 mm type a was the most stretch resistant so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out p two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed and how long the plastic should be for each type should it be the same or different
3621,2,3,based upon the given data i can conclude that plastic b had the most stretchability the first thing the student needs to fix is in his experimental design in step 4 s he says to add weight but they don't specify how much weight to add the next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity the student needs to record the starting length of each plastic as well as keep their length constant p say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics
3622,2,3,a based on the students data plastic b was able to be stretched the most it was stretched 22 mm the first time and 23 the second p b first the student should have stated how much weight to add to the clamp and measured how much the clamp weighed to get the total weight added would've improved validity also the student should have made the plastic sample all the same length so that they started from the same point
3623,2,1,i predict according to this experiment that the student could improved their experiment by try one more time find out the contro find out the variables find out the independent variable dependent variable do a hypothesis conclusion that's what i think the student have to do to validify the results of the experiment
3624,2,3,a based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type b had the most stretchability for both trials preformed type b stretched the furthest at 22 mm 23mm therefore this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the 4 because it was able to withstand such stretching p b the students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just a b c or d also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths
3625,2,2,3 a base on the data given plastic b stickched for nest p b the student could have written the starting length of the plastic he also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment
3626,2,2,my conclusion is that plastic type a can stretch the least because not only did it not stretch anymore in t2 it actually got 1mm shorter plastic type a is the best because it can stretch the most it stretched 2mm more in t2 p b one way the student could have improved his her experimental design and or validity of the results is to include the data on what the plastics measured before he added weights he could have also included the weights of the weights he added
3627,2,0,a the amount stretched by t2 showed more improvement by having it stretched because the different material both were investigated at the same time one place was more affected p b one way is is by maybe leaving it a little longer or use different types of weight
3628,2,3,based on the students data we can conclude that plastic b has the most stretchability compared to plastics ac or d in trial 1 plastic type b stretched 22mm and 23mm in trial 2 all of the other plastics stretched less than this amount for example plastic a only stretched 10 12mm for trials 1 2 ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator they also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant the length of each plastic shows the same if the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected also the students could have also specified how much like weight is and used the same amount of weights for each one if one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg then the one with 31kg may stretch farther not because it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight this is how they could improve
3629,2,0,a in conclusion the amount strech t2 streched a little bit more than t1 by 2 mm i shows that t2 can strech more than t1 p b one way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics
3630,2,2,a from the results of the experiment you can see that plastic type b has the highest amount of stretchability while plastic type a has the lowest amount of stretchability p b the students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic and add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment
3631,2,2,based on the students data plastic a and b both stretched 1mm more on the second trial but the plastic type that had stretched the most in trial 1 and 2 is plastic b p the student could of improved this experiment by adding the weights but with a certain amount of weight that was used the same on each plastic and trial also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go
3632,2,1,a the data shows that trial two was more efficient than trial one because they all increase other than one plastic type i can also conclude that the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic b p b two ways the students could have improved there experiments are 1 let it hang for longer than five minutes and 2 perform more trials
3633,2,0,a my conclusion on the expirement is that plastic type d has the longest mm stretched out b 1 the student have put the plastic on a hanging string was a steamy boiling pot of water 2 then the student could have recorded more valid and improved data on a chart
3634,2,2,by the out come of this experiment you can tell that plastic b is the stretchiest two things that could have been done to improve the experiment are making sure how long the plastics should be in the beginning and if all the plastic types should be the same length before you tape them
3635,2,2,based on the student's data i can conclude that plastic types a and b stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results are that he should have written the beginning measurements of each piece of plastic and he should have tested each piece three times not just two
3636,2,1,the two ways that the students could have improved on this experimental design is one what kind of plastic where they using and name each one the second would be what would you measure the plastic what type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid
3637,2,1,a based on the results i can conclude that plastic types b and r had a similar stretchability because they increased by 1mm type c and d are not as stretchable because type actually decreased by 1mm after trial 2 and type d stayed the same p b the student should have told us much each weight and how many will go on the plastic types
3638,2,3,a plastic type b can stretch the most while a has the most tensile strength because it streched the least p b the student could have improved their design by having the plastic be the same lenghth for each plastic for example each could be a foot long a second change would be to put the same amount on each plastic for example each could have a lag weight
3639,2,0,in conclusion after doing this experiment i came to the conclusion that the plastic type by was the one with the longest length of the plastic types it had 22mm in the first trial and it had 23mm in the second trial p the student could've waited more than 5mins to measure the length
3640,2,1,my conclusion would be that plastic type d would be the most strechy because it went up to 20mm with out tearing two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the time it took to stretch
3641,2,2,a a conclusion i can draw from this is that plastic type a had stretched 22mm the first trial and 25mm in the second trial making it the most stretchable plastic type p b i think that this student should have done at least 3 trials i think this student should have not taped the plastic at the top of the table he should have done it over a bar so both sides could be tested
3642,2,3,a the plastic thas has the most stretchability is plastic type b a stretch of 22mm in the first trial and in the 23mm in the second trial plastic type a has the worst stretchability stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial p b they should have stated and used the same amount of weights for each trial they also should have used the same amount of each plastic
3643,2,1,a based on the student's data the amount of stretchability in each opastic type was different for trial 1 and 2 with an exception of type d that remained the same p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to clarify the weight of the weight they added on step 4 then for step 6 they should have had clarified the procedure that had to be repeated ex repeat steps 1 5 exactly for other three plastic plastic samples
3644,2,1,a i see that the amount stretched of plastic a b increased on the second trial but the amount stretched of plastic a decreased and the amount stretched for plastic d remained the same p b the student could have make a third trial to see what the outcome would be the student could have made the trials for another period of time so instead of five mns and he does ten minutes for each of them
3645,2,2,a based on the students trials i have come to conclusion that plastic b was able to stretch more than a c d witch make it more resistant then the rest p b the students could of group this experiment on each experiment to see how much it could change and they could of also made a graph to show the results
3646,2,1,a to conclude the polymer plastics went through four trials the data shows that a was averaged to 11 b was averaged to 22 5 c was averaged to 13 5 and d stayed at 20 the plastic type b stretched to most i predict that if they did a 3 rd trial the numbers would be close p b the students could of improved if they let the plastic hang for 10 minutes and maybe the results wouldn't be so close also add more details to the procedure
3647,2,2,a in conclusion plastic type a stretched 2mm more in the second than in the first trial plastic type b stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first plastic type c stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first trial plastic type d stretched the same amount in both trials p b to improve the validity the group could have stated how much weight to use and had more tests and trials
3648,2,1,students could have made his or her own hypothisis to test also should have the procedure more than 2 times
3649,2,2,based on the data b was the most stretchable polymer followed by d c and lastly a serious sources of error need fixing for one the initial length of plastic was not held constant making all data most also allowing the plastics to stretch until breaking would truly test this property however as the results are consistent between trials the results seem valid
3650,2,3,a based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most all of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results was to show the length before they were stretched and show the amount of weight added onto the clamps
3651,2,2,the plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type b it stretched 22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mm that shows it has the most durability for stretching p the students should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at they should have also included the time on the data table they should have done various trilas to the e3xperiment
3652,2,0,they could take notes and make a bar graph and put all of it together and come out with the answer p they could use a weight and find out how much the weight by its self
3653,2,0,by the process or doing it the graph showed me that the amount of stretched of t1 and t2 didn't change both plastic had the same stretched and it would change by adding more weights because the plastic wouldn't be resible as the other one
3654,2,1,a according to my conclusion b was the one who got stretch the longest and a was the shorter one b one way they could do this to make it better is by using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic to a cup and start putting weighs until it breaks
3655,2,2,for plastic type a the amount stretched increased by one mm for plastic type d the amount stretched for trial one and two were the same with plastic c the results decreased by one mm the students could improve their results by repeating more trials they also didn't mention the measure the plastic be originally
3656,2,0,the conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others they could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins
3657,2,2,a plastic type b stretch the most than d then c then a the second trial all of the plastic began to stretch even more beside plastic c plastic c didn't increase it's stretching in trial to actually in trial 1 it stretched more than in trial 2
3658,2,1,a plastic type b is the the most elastic plastic and type a is the least elastic plastic however all plastic types are elastic p b the student could have included a specific weight to use and they could have provided elastic types
3659,2,3,a i would conclude that plastic a is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics b c or d p b one thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results
3660,2,2,a plastic b is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types p b the validity should be improved if the students specified how much weight was added to the clamp also specified how high up the table was
3661,2,2,plastic b happens to stretch the furthis in trial 1 2 the student could have used more plastic also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy
3662,2,1,a in conclusion the student's data that was recorded showed plastic type b capable of stretching the most than d than c plastic type a stretched the least p b one way the students could have improved the experiment design validity of the results would be by learning a hypothesis another thing that could be an improvement is if they varied the times the plastic hanged for up the amount of weight for each type
3663,2,3,a based on the student data plastic b is the most stretchable plastic b stretched an average of 22 5mm while the next most stretched plastic was d with an average of 20mm p b to improve validity design the student could have conducted more trials the students also should have specified exactly how heavy the weights used are so that the experiment is recreatable
3664,2,2,a the more weight used the more the plastic stretched p b they should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table and specify if all the plastic pieces are the same length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them they should also say how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights
3665,2,3,by the result of the student's investigation they have concluded that plastic type b is the stretchiest polymer of all four and plastic type a is the least stretchiest polymer p three ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by starting off with each polymer with the same length the same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2
3666,2,1,a we can conclude that plastic type b is stronger because on the best trial i only stretched by mm then on the second trial it decreased to stretch by 1 more picture type a is strong but on the first trial it stretches 10mm while on the second trial it stretched mm more we would rather have the stretch decrease than increase b the students could have added more time to the bags being stretched and they could have done more trials
3667,2,2,3 a in conclusion plastic sample b stretched the most when testted for strechability it stretched nearly twice as much as samples a c but sample d was close in amount p b the first way the students could improve their experiment is to specify in how many weights they attached and make sure all the weights weighed the same they also could have been more specific about the clamp so they can have a control and nothing could effect the validity of the results
3668,2,3,there is not enough data to draw a conclusion from the students data the students never told us what the starting length of the polymer plastic where and they never told us how much the weight weighed
3669,2,0,for the name of color the plastic
3670,2,2,to conclude the polymer investigation according to data plastic a is the stretchiest plastic d is the least stretchy p two ways the student could have improved this experiment is by 1 telling us how long the plastic measured before it was stretched another way is by 2 how much did the weights weigh
3671,2,3,based on the students data it shows that plastic type a had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it in the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14 one way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment and it'd give a better understanding
3672,2,2,a a conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type b has the most flexibility b one way to improve the experiment would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same places another step would be to make sure the clamp was on the same place on each plastic so the experiment is more valid
3673,2,2,based on the students data plastic type b in trials 1 and 2 stretched the most and have the most stretchability p one way the student could improve this is by using the same weight for each bag and trial another way is by using the same clamp type so it's the same weight added from it each time
3674,2,2,a conclusion that can be reached based on the student's data would be that the best plastic type to use to prevent breakage of a bag would be type d it was not stretched at all when the weights were added one way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to conduct more trials and the average not the results this would ensure which plastic is the strongest another way to improve validity would be to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic type these two things must be done to ensure validity
3675,2,2,based on the data i can conclude that the plastics stretched more in the second trial compared to the first trial also i can conclude that plastic b stretched the most because it held the most weight one way the students can improve the experimental design is to include exactly what plastic they are using another way the could improve their experimental design is to include what they are using as weights foreach plastic
3676,2,1,a the plastic type b has the most stretchabilty because in both trials it had a large lengths p b the student could improve the validity of the results by making sure he kept the same time limit also he could made none he did not stretch the plastic by hand when releasing the weights
3677,2,0,the students could of lable the chart better than the did the could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for
3678,2,2,a that depending on the plastic type depends weather the plastic stretch or not and how much p b one way put the first length then the second on the chart another way titled the plastic types
3679,2,1,plastic type a stretches longer than the other plastic types the student could improve the experiment by putting the name of plastics and add another trial 3 trials are always best
3680,2,2,a i conclude that trial one and two have similar numbers so plastic b and d are the strechiest p b one way the students could have improved on the validity of the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic clamp at least tell us the kind and trand of tape another way this experiment would be better is if i leneth the weight that tore the plastic
3681,2,2,plastic type b has the greatest elasticity while plastic type a has lowest the student could improve validity by having more trials and recording starting mm
3682,2,1,conclusion the students got their information based on the test results which seem pretty reasonable p b two ways the student could have improved their experiment was have a control and have more trials
3683,2,0,a plastics a and b and c are more stretch resistant than plastic b and d also plastic b stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial p b one ways they could of told us the iv ov and the constants of the lab like why they are doing it
3684,2,1,in the end trial 2 of the experiment had stretched a couple mm longer a part from plastic d than trial 1 this experiment can be improved by keeping the weight on for 5 minutes longer to give a better result another way it can be improved is doing one more trial to get more results to compare for the lost mass to improve it is adding another plastic type to provide a variety of plastics
3685,2,3,based on the data we can conclude that plastic type b is the stretchiest since it stretches the most in both trials p keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length repeat trials again 3rd time
3686,2,2,a the strongest plastic was c p b they should have recorded the length of the plastic pieces and added it to the data table before testing and they could have added another test and used more weights
3687,2,1,plastic type d was the most stretched out of all of the other plastics the student needed to repeat the steps for a 3rd time also the student should not have used the same plastic over they should have gotten a new place do the results would show validity to results
3688,2,3,based on the student's results the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic b both trials it had the highest length it beat plastic d by 2 and 3mm p two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment at least one more time it helps the validity of the experiment another way he she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics
3689,2,3,plastic type b is the stretchiest type of the 4 plastic types this student tested p b the student could've specified how many weights to add and how much each weight weighed
3690,2,3,plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four the students could have ensured that all the plastics are the same length before they begin the experiment they could have also added specific amounts of weight rather than simply adding a random amount this would have made the experiment more conclusive
3691,2,1,a the plastic was stretched but not a lot at the most it was stretched two inches p b they could have said how heavy the weights were also state what type or brand of plastic is being used
3692,2,2,in conclusion the experiment has even led that the four different polymer plastics neither stretch very far each trial or didn't stretch very far at all p two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and or validity of the results are giving us the starting measurements and doing the trial a third time to see if the results change or show the same
3693,2,3,the validity of the data is questionable but one conclusion is that plastic a was the strongest because it stretched the least p two things the students could have done to improve his experimental design validity of his results are 1 data certain leng
3694,2,3,a out of all 4 plastics type b was the most stretchable for both trials d was the second most stretchable c the third and a was the least to improve the experimental design the student should have specified the length of the plastics and made sure they were all the same continuity and accuracy of the results another thing that should have been done is the mass of the weights should have been included and it should have been specified that they were all the same to again ensure accurate results
3695,2,1,3 for the conclusion the students could of put what kind of plastic they used also they could made the data table a little more details p the students could have improved their experiment by baming some of the plastics also they could of put the size of the weights
3696,2,0,plastic type d stay the same they should had left more minutes to hang
3697,2,2,a from the students data table i came to a conclusion that plastic b is more stretchable p b they could have done more trial and try other plastics
3698,2,2,a plastic type b has the most stretchability and plastic type a has the least stretchability p b the student could have told how much weight they put on the plastic they could of also explained how plastic types become smaller
3699,2,1,based on the students data plastic type d had the most stretchability it stretched 20mm 0n t1 and stretched the same in t2 while a stretched 2mm and b stretched 1mm and c went from 14mm on t1 and dropped to13mm on t2 p the ways the students could've improved the experimental design is by telling us how much weight they used and add more weight
3700,2,0,a plastic d length did not increase or decrease in both trials p b one way student p could have improved the experimental design by letting it hang for more time to see how it was affected when it stretched since their results in both trials were close they shouldve tested it rersus another
3701,2,1,a in conclusion t2 stretched alot more than t1 they were trying to investigate witch kind of plastic stretched more p b two ways the student could of improved their design was explain clearly what they were doing and why in their procedure also maybe they should of did a t3 to realy test it because if it was different in t1 and t2 then they definitaly dont have a final answer
3702,2,2,in conclusion the type of polymer does affect its ability to stretch because plastic types a b indeed did stretch by at least 1 2 mm however plastic types c d either got smaller shrinked or did neither stretch nor decrease but remained the same p two ways this design could have been improved would be to have an equal amount of weights placed on all clamps and do more than 2 trials
3703,2,3,a based on the student's data polymer plastic type b was the most stretchable and polymer plastic type a was the most resistance to stretching or the strongest type b stretched an average of 22 5mm while type a stretched only an average of 11mm and types c and d came in the middle stretching averages of 13 5mm and 20mm type a had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type b had the weakest p b the first improvement could have been to include control by testing the stretchability of the materials or plastics without polymers or running trials on the same plastics without adding weights to have a valid comparison to see if the polymers are actually what are affecting their stretchability the second improvement could be to make sure each plastic is of the same thickness as that can affect stretchability they could also use more precise instrument or run more trials
3704,2,3,a plastic type a is stronger and stretches less slowest then c d and b p b make each plastic the same starting lenth and the weights are the same weight
3705,2,3,as a conclusion to the data shown on the table plastic b had the most stretchability according to the data collected the information is reliable because the amount stretched in t wasn't too different than t2 the student could've made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact length of each plastic to start with and made them all the same also the student should've been exact about the weights and made sure it was the same for all of them
3706,2,2,plastic type a stretched the least followed by types c and d leaving b to be the stretchiest plastic type two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to test at different time periods and to specify the amount of weight is being added to the clamp
3707,2,2,a plastic b is the most elastic because it had the highest average amount stretched at 22 5mm type a was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm p b the student have given a specific amount for the weight to be used in addition the amount to be off the table should be given because the amount hanging off affects how far it will stretch p and controlled for each trial
3708,2,3,plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type a is the least stretchiest plastic the students could have improved there design by naming the type of brand of type they used and the amount of it to hold the plastic wrap another improvement would be measuring the amount of plastic so that it would be the same amount for each plastic type and using the same weights for each trial so that the results would be correct
3709,2,2,based
3710,2,2,a based on the data present in conclusion we can say that plastic type d was the most stretchable plastic type we can make this conclusion because plastic type d stretched 20mm the longest farther than a 12 10mm b 23 22mm c 14 13mm p b the students could have used a more study material than tape to tyld up the plastic sample so it would not affect the stretching of the material the students also could have specified a specific weight to use for each plastic type so that they were being pulled the same amount
3711,2,2,according to the students data plastic type b seemed to stretch the most among the other plastic types as it stretched 23 mm after that 2 plastic type a stretched only 12mm therefore it stretched the least plastic types c reached 13mm and plastic type d reached 20mm b two ways in which students could have improved their experiment is by stating exactly how many weights one should add to the clamp and use a control to improve the valiaty of the results
3712,2,2,conclusion in conclusion polymer plastic b had the most stretchability with 25mm and polmer plastic a had the least almost of stretchability with 12mm validity he could of bad more trials and include plastic types in his procedure
3713,2,1,a based on the information it have plastic type b has a high stretchability compared to plastic type a whas stretchability is very low p b they should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out
3714,2,0,t1 and t2 are very close with their data they could've increased the time to hang the plastics to ten minutes instead of five they could have named the plastics
3715,2,0,due to the data each time the student adds weight the plastic length seem to increase after the amount of time for example i the type a plastic the first experiment is different their the seemed on because the doings strecht the plastic more after the first trial the two ways i believe the student should have improved the experiment is by using different kind of plastic and weights
3716,2,2,based on the student's data plastic type b stretched the most and the 2nd trial t2 proved that two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are doing a third trial to more fully ensure accuracy and doing something different in the 2nd trial like waiting 10 minutes instead of just 5
3717,2,1,a plastic type b is easily the most sufficient plastic because it had the highest measurements for both trials p b 1 they could of easily measured for more time this way they could see how much more it could stretch 2 they could of had one more trial usually an experiment has 3 trials this way average will be more precise
3718,2,2,based on the student's data we can conclude that plastic type d had the most stretchability the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results by doing more trials so there can be an average of the amount stretched instead of having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating how much the weight should weigh because different weight size could cause the plastic to stretch more or less
3719,2,2,a the students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial except for plastic type c and d which decreased and stayed the same p b the student could have performed another trial they also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it and show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched
3720,2,3,a my conclusion is that plastic b stretched more than the other types of plastic because plastic a stretched up to the average 11 and plastic b had an average of 22 5 p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental are 1 the student could do more trials and 2 the student could gave the information about the measure of each sample of plastic
3721,2,2,a based on the data shown the polymer plastics will streach but not much plastic type a streached out the most out of the four p b one way the students could have improve is by doing more trials another way it could be improved is by stating how much the weights weigh how many are being put onto the plastic
3722,2,2,a the conclusion could be that plastic d was the strongest of the plastics because it did not stretch at all p b two ways this exparement could have been improved is by telling how much waright to add to the clamp and the dementions of plastic
3723,2,3,a plastic type b had the most stretchability while plastic type a had the least p b all the plastics should be the same length make a machine add the weights and remove them and the clamp b c a human may place the weight w a different amount of force for every plastic put two clamps instead of tape b c the tape may evert it's own force while the clamps wont
3724,2,3,a in conclusion plastic type b was the most stretchable plolymer plastic p b the student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic
3725,2,2,a since there were four different types of plastics type b seemed to stretch the longest both trails because it is most likely the strongest p b perform even more trials for validity and be are to keep the clamp the weights and wherever you hang the plastic constant for each trial you could also perform a control experiment with no weights
3726,2,2,a in trial two the plastics stretched more expect for plastic c p b the students could have done another trial they could be specific with how much the weights weigh the students could have named the typed of plastic they used instead of using a b c and d
3727,2,2,i could concluded that plastic type b was stretched the most after the experiment which would instate that it is the most flexible on the other hand plastic type a streched the least meaning it is the least flexible cut of the 4 plastic types to improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data the weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results
3728,2,3,a in conclusion polymer b is the one that could stretch the most and polymer a is the one who can't stretch as wide p b to make the validity of the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurment for example in step 2 the could of said how much it should be hanging by also the could of added another trial it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes
3729,2,1,a a conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic b is the strongest out of all the plastic at 22mm in the first trial had 23mm in the second trial because it stretch more than all the other p b two the student could have improved the experimenting and or validity of the result are to add new types of plastics and add more trials to the containers
3730,2,2,out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type b the least amount stretched was plastic a two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results would have tried different time lengths maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics
3731,2,1,a according to the students data 2 4 of the plastics stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial by the minimum of 1mm p b two ways the student could have improved their experimental design is 1 they should have taken more trials at least two more and 2 they should used more types of plastics
3732,2,2,based on the data a conclusion would be that the plastic types pretty much were the same as each trial give or data a mm each trial p this ways the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much the weight weighed and did that weight stay the same for every types of plastic
3733,2,2,in conclusion based on the data from the chart each trial for plastics a b c and d were increasing decreasing or staying the same the most stretchable would be plastic b it started off as the stretchiest before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords p b the student could have said what types of plastic was used and not just a b c or d he also could have done more than 2 trials 3 would have been better
3734,2,1,in conclusion plastic type b was the strongest plastic in trial 1 it stretched to 22 mm while plastic d only stretched to 20mm and c to 14mm in trial 2 plastic b stretched to 23mm while d only stretched to 20mm and c to 13mm one way the student could have improved their experimental design was to stretch the plastic until it was about to brake to get the full stretchability the student could have also done more trials to get more valid results
3735,2,1,1 my conclusion would be that plastic type d stretched the most but not the same amount the 2nd trial it stretched 1 mm more than the 1st trial and plastic type a stretched the least t1 10 mm and t2 12mm but it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial than the first p two ways they could have improved the experimental design and for identify of results is they could have made another trial t3 at least and could have let the weight hang longer than 3 minutes
3736,2,1,a and c did not stretch too far but b and d stretched much more the student could have given the beginning lengths in his data or he could have added more and more weights and seen how far the plastics would stretch
3737,2,3,a the most plastic type b had the most stretchability in the trial it stretched 22mm visible plastic type a stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm while type a stretched 12mm p b the students should had the lengths of the plastics start out he same that way no plastic could be able to hold more weights since it was longer students should also specify how many weights are added for five minutes so that way a plastic doesn't stretch more just because it had more weights
3738,2,0,according to the data table plastic type a was the most strechable type b and c decreased when measured again after having placed weights and type d stayed the same therefore type a was the most strechable considering the longitude it made by 2mm
3739,2,2,based on our results of the polymer investigation we found out that plastic type a stretched the most of two mm type b stretched the second furthest at 1mm and type c lost 1 mm and finally type d didn't lose or gain any length two ways the student could have improved the validity was to make sure he used the same amount of weight at the end of the plastic and that the plastic was taped at the same spot at the top of the table
3740,2,3,i can conclude that plastic type b was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type p b the student could have added more trials to secure the validity that plastic type b had the most stretchability the student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weigh
3741,2,1,based on the students data plastics type d stretched the most in both trials two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is one way they could of have one more trials and see the results another thing they could have done was try to stretch the plastic over a different type of texture
3742,2,2,a as shown by the data plastic b was the plastic that stretched the most all the other plastics were between10 20 while plastic b needed the with 22mm and 23mm b a control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment more trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes
3743,2,0,a it appears that sample a was the strongest after trial 1 it was 10mm and after trial 2 it was 12mm samples b and d were the weakest sample b after trial 1 was 22mm and sample d was 20mm and after trial 2 sample b was 23mm and sample was 20mm p b one way the student could have improved the experiment is by specifically saying what plastic he was testing another way is by saying how much the weights weighed
3744,2,2,a based on the procedure the results were not valid how much weight am i supposed to add p b the validity could have been improved by telling me how much weight to add or what kind of weights to use
3745,2,1,from the student i can draw the conclusion that plastic types d has the least amount of stretchability it did not stretch at all the student had a very thorough procedure but they could have improved it they could have added more weights to the plastics to see how much weight it could have taken to stretch as well as done more than two trials for each of the different plastics
3746,2,3,a from the data i am draw the conclusion that polymer b had the most stretchability polymer plastic b stretch an average of 22 5mm which was greater than polymer a c and d p b to improve this experiment the students should make sure that the amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that the type of plastic was the only variable involved also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid with more trials the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate
3747,2,2,the students conclusion would be that plastic b stretched the most for t1 it stretched 22mm and for t2 it streched 23 mm p b the students could have done more trials they also could of hard more plastics
3748,2,3,a plastic type b is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested plastic a is the strongest and stretche the least amount p b the student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length also must have had the same amount of weights applied
3749,2,3,a according to the student's data plastic type b is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types p b first the students could have used a specific length for each plastic strip to begin with because they will most likely stretch more if they are longer to begin with second they should make sure that they add the same weight for each trial and plastic because they are measuring chevibility not how much weight each can hold
3750,2,0,each type of plastic stretched about the same or a couple millimeters off to its counterpart in the second trial the students could have improved the design by getting and telling specific types of plastic to use and to tell us what unit of measurement to measure the unstretched and then stretched plastic
3751,2,3,a conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type b was the most stretchable of the plastics the student could improve their experimental design would be to make sure all the different plastics were the same length before the weights were added and make sure to include that original measurement in the data table the student should also keep the number of weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another it may appear to have stretched more
3752,2,0,the students have to make sure the test results are accurate and that the answers are precise
3753,2,3,a based on the data it can be concluded that plastic types b has the least streghth or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics plastic d is the second and plastic c is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity since plastic a had the least stretched legnth it is the strongest or least plastic plastic p b to improve the validity of this experiment it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table and is clamped at the same spot as well this will allow for the removal of other ine wencing factors it is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used the same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment
3754,2,2,the plastic type b had stretched the most to improve this lab they could of did more trials to see if their results were correct and give us what each type of plastic is and write a hypothesis based on the start of the lab to know the task at hand
3755,2,1,based on the data table both trails were basically the same but they could have improve the experiment by using different weights so they could see the difference also the shouldn't have add a clamp to the and of the plastic
3756,2,1,plastic type d has 19 better chance of having stretchability because during both trials the amount stretched out equal so it has a accurate chance of stretching the student could have improved this experimental design by adding another trial and reapeating the same procedure
3757,2,2,due to the data i can tell that type d streches the 2nd most but was consistent through both trials i can also see that type a streched the least amount type b though streches the most from the data i know that type b plastic is the best because it can strech the most without breaking this means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds the student could have improved their experiment by saying how much weight they added as well as be more specific in the procedure about the plastic types
3758,2,3,i can conclude that plastic type a is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching i would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial
3759,2,2,a the plastic b has the most amount that stretched p b the student could of improved their data's by using more tests and not the weights an for more time
3760,2,0,a according to data table the plastics had verry little change from trial to trial for an example plastic type a for trial was 10mm and trial 2 was 12 so it stretched more the second time and for b trail 1 was 22 and trial 2 was 23 for c t1 was 14 and t2 was 13 but a changed happened on plastic c the measurement stand the same for both trials with amount of 20 b two ways the students had did different times for each trial also the clamp they should have put the plastic some where else cause maybe the clamp had added more weight
3761,2,3,based on the student's data t concude that plastic type a was the strongest plastic because it streched the least amount two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design are adding a trial 3 and recording the original length of the plastic
3762,2,2,a based on the student's data i can conclude that the plastic type d was the strongest polymer stretching 20mm in trial one and trial 2 i can also conclude that the plastic type a was the weakest polymer stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial b one way the students could have done to improve their experiment is perform more trials another way the students could have improved their experiment is to record in the table how many weights used
3763,2,1,a when the four different polymer plastics were tested for stretchability a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data table p b two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results was by increasing the time the material have to hang and repeat the trial a third time
3764,2,2,in conclusion polymer plastic b is the plastic that stretched the most in this investigation p the student could have added to the results the name each polymer plastic also made each polymer plastic the sam length to start with and test each one at the same time
3765,2,1,a i conclude that 12 has stretched more than 11 p b two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is by 1 they could have added the amount of weights they used 2 they could have timed it
3766,2,1,a it seems that seems that most of the bags stretched a little more in the second trial p b i think the student could have improved this experiment by doing more trials
3767,2,2,a conclusion i can make from this experiment is that plastic type b stretched the longest and that plastic a streatched the least p b two ways the students can improve there experiment is by more trials and to put the plastic type in the procedure for example this student said take a sample of one type instead she cold have said whch one
3768,2,3,i can conclude that the plastic a stratched the least from all the plastics used and plastic b stratched the most from all the plastics used plastic a stratched less because it was better than plastic b the student should have done more than 2 trials and also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag so we could know how much it was before it stratched
3769,2,3,based on the student's results polymer b was able to stretch the furthest length being 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial two p two ways that the student could improve the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the weight of each weight and by performing an additional trial
3770,2,2,my hypothesis of i believe that plastic type b will stretch the longest was correct plastic type b stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial to improve this expiriment i would have included 2 more trials to make sure my expiriment was as valid as possible i would also make sure that the temperature of the room i was in was same throughout the expiriment because a slight change in that could cause a big difference between the flexibility of the plastic at that time
3771,2,2,based on the students data plastic type b and c stretched the most while plastics a and c stretched the least in both trials p one thing the students could have done was include the length before the weights were put on it another thing they could have done is tell the actual weight amount keep it constant for all plastic types
3772,2,1,some plastics are stronger than others p added more weight p rock certeni brands of waiter bottets
3773,2,1,two ways the student could of improved this experiment is if he would of kept adding weights and masure how low it can go until it breaks another way he could of improved this experiment is instead of taping it down a edge tape it down a wall so the force can go straight down my conclusion based in the students data is the plastic type b is the most stretchable
3774,2,0,when the student tested each plastic a stretched 2 times more than before b only stretched once more c went down 1 in the second trial but d stayed the same the way the student could of improved there experiment would be if they graph each trial for each plastic so we could see if it increased decreased or stayed the same
3775,2,2,a a conclusion i've drawn according to this table would be that plastic type a is a stronger type of plastic p b 2 ways to improve the experiment would be to add more trials and to have more time of the hanging weights and plastic
3776,2,2,the conclusion i got for the lab is that there can't be one we don't know the original lengths of plastic we only have the two lengths after they were stretched p 1 improvement they should make is to add the original length of the plastic another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic
3777,2,2,plastic type b streched the most at 45mm over the two trials and plastic a streched the least at 22mm p the student could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and specify what kind of plastics they are using
3778,2,2,a plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic in trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm p b 1 the student could have had the clamps attach at the same height in each type of plastic p 2 the student should have used the same amount of tape on each type of plastic
3779,2,2,a plastic type a is shown to be the strongest while plastic type b is not plastic type a stretched at an average of 11mm while type b stretched an average of 22 5mm p b the students could have improved their experiment by listing what weight to use and tell which type of lope to use
3780,2,2,a i can infer that plastic type b is the strongest as it stretched the most p b the student could have improved the experimental design by creating 3 trials and creating an average of the 3 also the student should of listed the length of the plastics before and after stretching
3781,2,3,a based on the student's data plastic b stretches the most and plastic a is the most rigid p b the students could have improved their experimental design by using something stronger than tape to hold the plastic they also could have done more trials since their results between the two trials varied significantly
3782,2,3,1 the student can conclude that plastic b stretches the most according to the data plastic b stretched the most both trials twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second while the other plastics stretched less p 2 the student should perform a third trial for accuracy and the student should keep a constant number of weights attached to each plastic
3783,2,3,based on the results plastic b stretched the most than d c a p the student could of validated his statement more by giving more amounts like how much plastic and how much weight they could also of validated it by doing the trial a 3rd or 4th time so it was more accurate
3784,2,2,plastic type a was the least stretchable it only stretched 10 12mm plastic type b was the plastic with the greatest stretchability it stretched 22 23mm the two trials confirm this result the students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same also this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched not how far they stretch if they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached
3785,2,1,a based on the data plastic type b was the best best plastic to resist the weight stress p b the student must have added a control group and performed more trials
3786,2,3,a based upon the data plastic b was the most flexable while plastic a was the least flexable p b the students could improve the experiment in two ways 1 add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment 2 create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length
3787,2,2,a conclusion that i can make based off this data is plastic type a had the biggest size difference between the two trials one way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length this could help determine which plastic's better another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp if one plastic has more weights than the another it will make this experiment not valid
3788,2,2,my conclusion would be according to the data shown plastic b has the highest amount being stretched in trial one and as well as trial two two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be if they would tell us how much weights to clamp on also in the table include how much each weights were added on as well as try half with weights and the other half with none
3789,2,1,according to the data given plastic type b had more stretchability than plastic type a however the students should have stated the four types of plastics they used also they should have kept the measure of plastic samples consistant
3790,2,3,a based on the results you can tell that plastic type b can hold the most weights and plastic type a can hold the least weight p b two ways the students could improve the experiment was to do three trials for an accurate results and have every thing the same measurement to also be accurate
3791,2,1,a a conclusion in the student's data is that plastic type d stretches more than the other plastics do p b the student could have improved by adding on the procedure what types of plastics to use also the student could have added how much were the weights he used
3792,2,2,from the data presented that plastic type b can be stretched the farthest but to improve this experiment i would do more trials to make it more accurate also changing the environment could improve the experiment by controlling the temperature you can find out which plastic stretches farther in a hot environment or what stretches farther in a colder environment
3793,2,2,based on the student's data plastic type b stretched the most in t1 it stretched 22mm and in t2 it stretched 23mm on the other hand plastic type a stretched the least in t1 it stretched 10mm and in t2 it stretched 12mm so therefore type b and type d were pretty close to one another p one way the student could have improved the experimental design is by specifying the amount of weight attached to each clamp another way is by also specifying the amount of the edge taped to the table
3794,2,3,a the conclusion is that plastic type d is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic a p i'd improve this they should have included how much weights was put into each bug and also measurement of the bag before they do the experiment
3795,2,2,a plastic type b has the most stretching ability as well as plastic a having the least p b 1 they could have specified which plastics they used not just a b c d 2 they could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps
3796,2,1,plastic b is the most ductile followed by plastics d c and a respectively when discussing the validity of the experiment it is best to have an average of the two trials also this person did not include the initial length unstretched of the plastics they should have all been cut to the same length to start with
3797,2,1,based on the data i can conclude that plastic a b stretched more than c d the student could have improved the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials with more trials it is easier to take a more accurate average next the could also say the type of plastic instead of saying a b c d their experiment would be better developed easier for the reader to follow this is what can be concluded from the data along with what could be improved throughout the experiment
3798,2,2,based on the data you can draw of conclusion of plastic type d not stretching from t1 or t2 the plastic measured 20mm both trials the student also could have included how much plastic is being used the students also should have included how much many weights you hold on to the clip
3799,2,2,a in conclusion it is clear that plastic type a stretched the least over the five minutes the plastic that was the stretchiest was plastic b p b add a control with no weight added and a third trial
3800,2,2,i conclude that polymer b had the highest rate of stretchability of 22mm for t1 and 23mm for t2 p the student could have added a control group and the student should have told us how much weight to add
3801,2,2,a the data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial p b they could have tested it one more time and if they do they test would be conclusive and be able to draw a conclusion
3802,2,3,a plastic b has the greatest ability to stretch because it stretched the most in t1 and t2 p b one way to improve the experiment would be to specify how long each sample is at the beginning of each trial and have them all the same initial length i e 20mm p another way to improve this experiment is to specify an exat weight to be clamped to each plastic sample i e 100 grams
3803,2,0,a both trial 1 and trial 2 are basically the same and their constant to each other their wasn't a big change p b maybe for step 4 they could add more time and get heavier weights
3804,2,3,for the polymer investigation lab experiment my conclusion from the data is that plastic type b was the most breack resitance and streched the most at 22 23 mm two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one it said to measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the plastics my second thing is how heavy are the weights in the experiment that hung on the bag
3805,2,3,according to the student's data plastic type b had the greatest capability of stretching because it stretched an average of 22 5 mm plastic type a only stretched and average of 11 mm one way the students could change the experiment is by cutting each plastic sample length may be a contributing factor affecting results another way to improve the experiment is by taping all the plastics at the same place on the table so an equal amount of plastic is hanging of the edge
3806,2,1,a
3807,2,3,in total we came a conclusion that plastic type b stretched the furthest in both trials i and ii and plastic a stretch the least in trials i and ii p two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and or results was by stating how many the weights were and did more trials
3808,2,3,based on the student's data plastic a stretched the least amount plastic b stretched the most plastic d stretched the same amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and trial 2 to improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time different weights can cause different results
3809,2,1,to conclude this experiment i would state that plastic b stretched the most in trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm compared to plastic a reriching 10mm to improve the students experiment i would have them make sure that when they put the plastic bag dawn they put it at the same space for a more accurate answer and lastly they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment
3810,2,0,a the polymer experiment looks it went very well each plastics amount that was stretched was all around the same number for both trials two types of plastics increased after the first trial one type of stay the same amount and one type of plastic decreased after the first trial p b i don't think the student needs any thing to improve this experiment
3811,2,1,a as a conclusion based on the data t2 plastic tests were more elastic than ti p b the student could improve this by addressing how many weights were used and allow them to hang for at least two minutes more and to get new plastic tap instead of using the remaining 3
3812,2,2,plastic type b was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2 the student could have added a control in these and also he could have done more trials for each separate type of plastic
3813,2,1,a based on the data i concluded that plastic b was the best plastic in trial 1 it measured 22 mm and trial it measured 23mm meaning it was the sturdiest plastic p b the student could have measured the plastic before doing the experiment making it a free trial and the students could have added the weights and see how much weight it could hold before it fell to the floor instead of waiting for 5 minutes
3814,2,0,a based on the students data i can conclude that plastic types a and b are stretchable while plastic types c and d made no improvement p b a way the experiment and validity could have been improved is by allowing the weights to hang longer another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled
3815,2,2,a i conclude that plastic b worked the best because it held in most weight like 22 23 and the lowest was 10 12 so terefore plastic b works the best p b what they could have done was add more trials or change the type of cup
3816,2,2,a plastic type b is the strechiest p b the students could have done more trials the student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison
3817,2,1,a plastic type b and d are better to use because they stretch the stretchiest plastic b can stretch up to 20mm at most while plastic d can stretch up to 23 mm at most plastic c and plastic a can stretch the least because plastic c can stretch up to 14mm at most while plastic a can stretch up to 12 mm at most p b two ways they would have improved the experiment is by adding more trials and telling what each plastic actually was
3818,2,0,a i can conclude that t2 did better than t1 and that plastic type b did better than a c d p b
3819,2,2,a conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type b stretched the farthest over all because in the data it says it stretched 22mm and 23 mm as where the other plastics did not stretch as far p two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by having a control and by giving an exact measurement for how much plastic you should use because if there is a larger piece it could look as if is stretched farther than it really did
3820,2,2,plastic b has the greatest stretchability p the student can improve his experiment if he does more trials uses different types of weights increases the hang time and uses one more plastic
3821,2,3,based on the data the b type plastic is the most stretchable in the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm the student could improve the experiment by through if he tells us which amount of weight he used also the student could try the experiment for a longer period of time and then do this experiment than twice
3822,2,2,a the students could conclude that plastic b is the most stretchable out of the four plastics because it ended up the longest in both trials after it was stretched p b one way to improve this experiment would be to specify in step 4 how many pound of weight are being stretched this would make sure that in each experiment it is the same amount of weight that is pulling the plastic down another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals
3823,2,2,plastic type b had the most stretchability because it stretched further than any other plastics for both trials the student should have done another trial and have a control group
3824,2,1,two ways the students could have improved this experiment could have been by telling me what they were using as weight and also how they were measuring the plastic after the trial was over
3825,2,0,in conclusion this experiment is not accurate because it did not list the type of plastics that would be used for this experiment the time was not even recorded there has got to be evidence throughout this experiment for plastic type d the amount stretched was the same by 20 min i want to know what type of materials were used p the student could have recorded the time and also show the type of materials that were used throughout the experiment
3826,2,3,plastic type b stretched the furthest in both trials meaning that it had the largest stretchability one way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to specify and include in the procedure or clarify in this data table if that was the the dermensions of his plastic samples that way same the able would be the results were strictly describing and comparing the stretchability of the samples and there were an outside source trying the outcome another way he could improve the validity of his lab is regulate how much weight he added to the clamp and a lot include that in his procedure or data table in order to present his experiment more clearly
3827,2,2,a the more weights added to sample b and a the more they stretched plastic c shrunk as weight was added to t1 plastic d could have be stretched p b 1 the student could give the starting lengths so there was something to compare the results to p 2 the students could have mention how many weights were added each how much weight was pulling on the plastic
3828,2,2,a conclusion i can make is trial plastic type d is the most stretchable and type a is the least stretchable the student could have improved the experiment by indicating and using a specific amount of weights that is unchanging between plastic types and trials also the student could have indicated and used a certain length and width of each plastic that is the same for each trial and type of plastic
3829,2,2,a plastic type b stretched the greatest amount and therefore held the most weight p two ways the students' could have improved their experiment are by including the much each weight weighed and the exact length of each plastic used to validate their results a constant variable was not included
3830,2,2,a based on the students data plastic type b was stretched longer than any other plastic type p b two ways the studen could have improved the experimental design was at given what type of plastic they used and to provide the amount of weigh they added to each clamp grams lbs o2 etc
3831,2,2,a it seems that in 11 the most ductile polymes is plastic type b at 22cm for 12 it is again plastic type b at 33cm so it seems type b polymes is the ductule polymes p p b to better enhance the results of the polymer expirement then shouldue incuid the length of tht polymes unstreched
3832,2,0,for both trials they had similar results they could have improved their experiment by adding more weights instead of keeping them the same
3833,2,2,in my polymer investigation i discovered that plastic type b had streched the most in both trial with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trail 2 the plastic type to stretch the least was type a with t1 being 10mm and t2 12 mm one way the could of improved the validity of the results is to make a average of both trials also another way is to say how much weight is being used to show consistency finally they need a control with no weight because the clamp effects the data
3834,2,0,a conclusion for this experiment could be type t2 had been the strongest for the 1st two trials and then type t1 started lasting longer and in the end they stayed the same still showing that type t2 was the best choice it showed that in the end type b was the strongest the students could have improved their experiment by naming the types of bags brand they were testing and they also could have clamped the bag a different way for example taping it to both sides and putting weights
3835,2,2,this instigation has showed that the polymer from plastic type b was the most strechable than the rest this experiment could've been altered by adding that each weight should have been carefully placed especially towards the end there should've been a certain amount of weights put on so that the measurement of the plastics were done fairly
3836,2,3,the conclusion of the investigation could be that plastic a was the best because when weights were added didn't stretch that much compared to the other plastics two ways the student could've improved the experiment is by adding the same weights to each plastic and when starting the experiment use plastics with the same length
3837,2,3,plastic type b has the highest stretchability as it stretched 22 and 23mm the furthest plastic type a is the least stretchable it only stretched 10 and 12mm the least out of all this experiment would be more validif the student had 3 trials instead of only 2 to rule out any problems the student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic
3838,2,2,a plastic type b has the most stretchability in all plastic samples and plastic type a has the least b he could repeat the lab more and increase variables tas
3839,2,0,the conclusion came out to be that the 2nd trial wasn't really that much at a difference between trial 1 most of them was 2 or 1 difference d stood the same
3840,2,2,my conclusion is plastic type b is the most stretchy in t1 it stretched to 22m and in t2 it stretched to 23 the least stretchy would be plastic type a in t1 it got to 10 and in t2 it got to 12 i order of the stretchiest would be b d c and a they could have taken some time of step 4 and did one to two more trails
3841,2,1,in conclusion two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to add a weight to the clamp and let them hang for more time also another way the student could have improved the design is to add the same weights to the plastic
3842,2,3,a based on the experiments plastic type a is the strongest of all plastics plastic b is the weakest b is the weakest because it stretched the most and this could be because the plastic is thin while plastic a was more thick instead of a linear polymer like b plastic a was probably a tratched polymer with many different bonds p b to improve the expirement the students should have use the same amount of each plastic to test the size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement they should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant
3843,2,1,i think plastic d is the strongest because it's the highest weight and they are both even in trial 1 and 2 p the first thing they can change is add a few more trials so they can really see if it stays the same or changes another way is to add more weight to each piece of plastics
3844,2,2,plastic b can stretch the most they could've said the weight of the weights are used
3845,2,0,b the student could have possibly added more weight to each trial that they did to get more reasonable and noticeable results the results shown below aren't as aromatic as you can see also the student could have added more time for each time he repeated the investigation
3846,2,2,based on the data i believe that plastic b has the best stretchability and its strong p the students could have added a trial 3 just so the experiment could be accurate and instead of cutting all the plastics yourself get precut so they all be the same size
3847,2,0,the conclusion is plastic type have 10 and 12 amounts stretched the two ways the students take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its length and add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes
3848,2,2,based on the students data you can tell that plastic type b was the strongest type of plastic based on the students data not only that plastic type b was the strongest it stretched the farthest too two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design is by the following ways the student should have told how heavy the weights were also the student should have told hoe much weights were needed in their experimental design
3849,2,0,this data is not accurate becaus they got a different number all the time and they only got the same number once
3850,2,3,nor
3851,2,2,based on the student's results it can be concluded that plastic type a stretched the most and has the most stretchability however their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to make all the plastic types the same initial length and then to record how much they stretched this would make the experiment more valid secondly they should have more than two trials to improve the validity of the results
3852,2,3,a plastic b is the stretchiest polymer plastic because of the amount of mm it stretched in the span of five minutes p b the students needs to make each sample of plastic the exact same size and to improve the validity the could complete a third trial
3853,2,3,plastic type b stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial they could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type they also could have done another trial for more accurate results
3854,2,1,a plastic b had the greatest lengths in both trials p b the students could have used more weight and they coud do the experiment over again to get better results
3855,2,2,we know that plastic type b stretched the furthest they could have said how long the plastic was when they started they could have put the names of the types of plastics
3856,2,2,plastic type b stretched the most one way the students could of improved the experimental design and validity is that they should of told how long it was before they tried and stretch it a second way they could improve it is tell you what type of plastic they used
3857,2,1,a based on the students data i conclude that plastic type b is the most flexible type a is the least and type d remained the same throughout the trials p b the studed could have improved the experimental design and validity of results by adding heavier weights to the experiment and extend or shorten the 5min time period
3858,2,0,i don't think that's a valid answer but do to their conclusion depending on the plastic it could either increase or decrease in size
3859,2,0,a the second try has almost the same amount of stretchability the first try has p b when added weights allow them to stay for more than 5 minutes p or they could of stretched it out more wider
3860,2,2,a the strongest polymer would be plastic type b it is plastic type b because it stretches the most out of all the other plastics in both trials p b one way that you would increase the validity would to measure how much a plastic stretched when you put the clamp on it another way to further validity the experiment is to do a lot more trials for more results
3861,2,2,a based on the data plastic type b stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least this tells me that plastic type b is the most stretchable p b they could have added some sort of control and added one more trial both would help improve the accuracy of the results
3862,2,2,a plastic type b has the most stretchability with a difference of 2 to 3 mm with type d that has the second most stretchability followed by type c with a difference of 10 8mm with type b and type a with a difference of 4 1mm with type b b he should have specified the total weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the plastics it also could have measured all dimensions length width heights of the plastic types rather than just the length
3863,2,1,plastic type b is the type of plastic you want to put heavy products in because it is more durable than plastic type a which stretches only 12mm unlike plastic type b which is 23mm p one way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving the amount of how much the weights weighed also give the height of the table top to the floor
3864,2,3,a based on the data plastic b was the most strethible plastic this is because on average it stretched 22 5mm in length the next highest amount stretched by plastic d was an average of 20mm in length showing that plastic b stretched the most b one way the student's could've improved their design is by adding a third trial this could help make sure there was no faulty data such as an outlier they also could've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics otherwise for all the prove they could've been changing these weights which would've given them 2 independent variables therefore making their experiment invalid
3865,2,3,one conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample b has the best stretchability p the students could have made this better or more valid by having a third trial as well and state how much weight is being added to the plastic
3866,2,2,a based on the student's data plastic d is the best plastic type to use for stretchability p b students could have improved the experimental design or validity of results is by saying the type of plastics they used ex kitchen wrap grocery bag cooking wrap etc they should mention add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap and at last have more trials
3867,2,2,based on the student's data i can conclude that plastic b stretched the farthest on both trials and that plastic a stretched the least the student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type that would have given more information and also naming the types of plastics would have given us an idea of how the polymer plastics influence its stretchability also for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials
3868,2,0,a this base on the types of bag p b we could use anothe plastic type and will try the amount of stretching
3869,2,1,a plastic type b stretched the most at 22 mm and 23 mm plastic type a stretched the least with 10mm and 12 mm p b the students could have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic it is another way they could've improved is by saying the repeating steps
3870,2,2,based on the the student's data a conclusion would be that sample b is the stretchiest also materials c and d have good stretchability as long as you don't stretch it twice one way they could improve would be that instead of measuring the substances once you take the clamp off measure it with it on because once you take it off it will be shortened a little another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials
3871,2,1,a based on the data i can conclude that some of the plastics increase by 1 or decrease by 1 p b to improve the investigation the student should have added another trial to see how it improve
3872,2,0,in conclusion plastic type b was the strongest out of all the plastic types it stretched the most plastic type a was the weakest p these students could have improved their experiement by writing record your data in the procedure after each trial also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way
3873,2,2,a conclusion i've made based on the students data is all of the plastics increased the stretch except for plastic type c that decreased i also saw that plastic type b stretched the most two ways the student could have improved this experimental designs was by adding more trials and by using different kind of weights
3874,2,1,based on the student's data plastic b both trials had the most millimeters for the amount the plastic stretched plastic b first trial had 22 mm and the second trial had 23 mm also plastic d was the second plastic to have the most millimeters for plastic stretched at trial one it was at 20mm also for trial two one way the students could have improved their experiments is by letting us know if were suppose put weights in one at a time or how many also for the second trial the time to allow the plastic to hang could of decrease or increase
3875,2,2,according to the results polymer a is the strongest it could hold the most weight without stretching the more a polymer streched the closer it was to breaking so that is why a was the strongest the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results is to insure that they are using the name type of polymer for each one and that they are adding the same amount of weight to each polymer that will improve the results
3876,2,3,plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm plastic a stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm the students would have improved they experiment by writing more details like writing what was the begging length and write how much the weights weighed they also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic
3877,2,0,b 1 perform the second trial different than the first p 2 repeat with fresh plastic p 3 add more than one types of plastic
3878,2,3,it can be concluded that plastic type b is the stretchiest of the 4 plastics and that plastic type a is the least stretchiest two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was by doing more trials to data in more results and by specifying the exact mass of the weights hanging from the plastic
3879,2,3,plastic type a stretched the least they could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were they could have said how much weren't they used they finally could have said what the starting length should be
3880,2,3,from this experiment i can conclude that plastic type b stretches the most and plastic type a stretches the least p make all the other plastics the same size of the first one they also could of made another trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic
3881,2,2,in conclusion plastic type b was streched the most in trial one and in trial two to improve this experiment about polythers plastics for stretchability would be to use a different way to show the data for example a graph chart another way to improve this experiment would be to record the length of the plastic without having it stretched
3882,2,3,a the student's data shows that the type b plastic is the most stretchy while type a plastic is the least stretchy type c is almost the same firmness as a and d has almost the same stretch as b p b the students could have improved their experiment by stating the weight of the weights they used to make sure they used the same weight for each plastic type they could have repeated the experiment more to validate their results
3883,2,1,a in conclusion each a b c and d had different results a and c stretched more both trial 1 and 2 had different answers accept plastic type d it reamred the same p b to improve this experiment students could of made more trials for more accurate answers also repeat the steps
3884,2,0,they added up around each other meaning the stretched all almost the same all plastic it was the same both trials p they could put range info on the data table and they could of describe the procedure better
3885,2,1,from the data i concluded that type d plastic type holds its plastic under weight staying at 20mm and type a plastic type was the worse dropping 2mm they should've test the bags wit a variety of weight also i would've done one more trial to see if the numbers stayed constant
3886,2,3,based on the student's data plastic type b stretched the most compared to plastic type a c and d therefore b has the most stretchability two ways to improve the experimental design are to make sure each plastic starts at the same length and that the same amount of weights are used for each plastic
3887,2,3,a conclusion i have drawn is that plastic type b is the best plastic in this experiment i know this because the data shows that it had stretched the most compared to the other three plastics in five minutes two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the result would be in perform the experiment again and make sure the same weights are used by performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate by using the same weights we would know that the plastics are stretched fully
3888,2,3,a plastic b stretched the most d the second most c the second least and a the least p b for one student cased have included more trials only two trials is not that many and could have found and take results more trials would have increased the validity for another the inident have specified the weight of the weight in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weight would have been highly been held to both the experimental to design and the validity
3889,2,2,based on the data plastics type a stretched the least followed by b d c plastic a stretched the most with two mm one way they could improve it is to test it more times they could also have mentioned the weight of the weights he used to stretch the plastic
3890,2,1,in conclusion plastic type b stretched the most while a and c were approximately the same d stayed the same for both trials 20mm p the students could have preformed a 3rd trial with the plastic type also they could have let the plastics hang longer than 5 minutes
3891,2,1,b tell wat the a weightt of weights were
3892,2,2,that plastic a was more durable than plastic b p for one he she could been more specific with the plastic type and the amount of weight needed to be used
3893,2,2,the conclusion that i have draw from this data is that two plastic did stretch while one stay the same and on other seemed to shrink two ways that this student could have improved the experiment is by having what type of plastics that is going to be tested all the same length before the hanging them of the table and the amount of weight including there mass to improve the validity of this experiment and it results
3894,2,2,a the conclusion is that plastic type d is the material that has stretched the most plastic types a stretched the least one way that the student could have improved would be by adding a timer into the procedure also to have the same weights of each plastic
3895,2,3,a from this data one can conclude that plastic type b stretched the most in both trials the data supports that this polymer plastic has the most specified what length the four plastics should all start at in order to increase the validity of the experiment they could also have specified what amount of weight so that each plastic would be pulled by on equal amount
3896,2,3,plastic type b has the greatest stretchability out of the other four the student could have done more trials they could of also tell us a specific weight
3897,2,2,based on the students data the plastic type a of trial 1 was stretched less than the plastic type b of trial 1 from a 10mm and b 22mm also the trials have different results of type a from trial 1 plastic type a stretched 10mm and trial 2 plastic type a stretched 12mm the student could have improved the experiment design by adding more trial and measure the amount of weight
3898,2,2,the student's data revialed that plastic a could be most restitence to stretching one way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials another way is add control to the experiment
3899,2,0,a if you hang weights on plastic type b then it will stretch at least 2 3 inchs p b they could of told of what type of plastics they used and which one was the control
3900,2,2,by the data given in the table plastic type a was the most stretchable while plastic d was the strongest and didn't stretch at all the student could've improved the experiment by stating how much was the weight applied on the plastic also they could've used a better way to stick the plastic on the table
3901,2,1,in this experiment plastics a and c where the ones that streched least b and d streched the most plastic a in t1 streched 10 mm and in t2 it streched 12 mm plastic b streched 22 on t1 and 23 in t2 c streched 14 in t1 and 13 t2 d streched 20 in t1 and 20 in t2 so the are that streched most was plastic b i think the students could of improved the experiment by changing the way the streched to how fast you can rip and puncture also put less plastics to try
3902,2,2,a based on the student's data plastic type b stretched the most while type a was the least stretchable p b 2 ways the student could have improved are one tell what the length of each plastic was to begin with and make sure they are all the same length and also different lengths of time could have been tested like 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes
3903,2,3,a from the student's data we can conclude that plastic type b has the most stretchability stretching an average 22 5mm per trial compared to type d's 20mm type c's 13 5mm and type a's 11mm p b one way the student could have improved is by increasing the number of trials carried out which will increase data accuracy and lessen the effect of outlians a second way he could've improved is by stating the weight of the weights he used not specifying this could lead to variations of data and almost impossibility to replicate the experiment
3904,2,2,a plastic type b was the stretchiest and plastic type a was least stretchiest p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are one do a third trial for each plastic and two test a control which will not stretch
3905,2,0,a based on the data t'd like to include that plastic d had streched the longest of all i can also see that all the plastics streched except for plastic c it was the only plastic that got shorter rather than strech p b i think that the only improvement that this experiment needed was to possibly increase the tim 5more minutes before sarting the next trial validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials
3906,2,2,a the conclusion isthat plastic type b has more stretchability than the others p b two way the student could have improved the experiment was that they should have repeat the experiment multiple times to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be streched
3907,2,1,based on student data i noticed that the trial two t2 plastics stretched longer then most plastics in trial one t1 i believe the students could have made the time period that they were stretched for longer i believe some plastics could have stretched more also i think that in their procedure they should have discussed the amount of weights they put on the clamp for future reference
3908,2,2,a that for the first trial plastic type b stretched more for the second trial plastic type b stretched 1 more mm and it ended up the most plastic that has stretched p b the two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by having more trials and by using the types of plastics that they were using
3909,2,0,a conclusion i can make is that all the plastic types and trials were all about the same thing p hang the clamps for more than 5 minutes attach clamp to top edge
3910,2,3,based on the data provided by the studence i have concluded that plastic type b streched the most in both trial 1 and trial 2 p one way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by having a continuat for example they could have done a third trial to see if there was anymore change the second way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by giving the length of each plastic to see if they were the same
3911,2,2,a conclusion i draw from the data is that plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic of them all the data supports this answer cause on average it stretched 2 5mm farther than the others and 11 3mm farther then plastic a two ways students could have improved results of to include more trials cause its hard to get a good average of two trials also i would try adding more trials with different weights because maybe are plastic is the stretchable when at lower weight
3912,2,0,the two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples
3913,2,2,a from the experiment the students performed we can conclude that plastic type a stretched the most as compared to plastics type b c d because from t2 it started at 10 and to t2 it went to 12 whereas for the others it stretched only 1mm and in type a it stretched 2mm p b0 the students could improve this experiment by adding more trials so they could get better and more precise results they could also be more specific about the weights and tell us what to start with small weights and then gradually get to heavier ones or use all the same
3914,2,0,i dont think his stretchability investigation work i feel that the student didnt has to exactly respect everything 3 times and they didnt have add weights to clamp and allow them hang
3915,2,2,i can conclude that on average plastic b was the most stretchy plastic validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step 4 also the student could have stated an exact point on the table so that all plastics were in the same conditions to make the experiment more valid
3916,2,2,a in conclusion plastic b stretched the longest while plastic a stretched the least p b the student could of told us what type of plastic to use in the procedure the student could of also tried more trials to see if the stretched plastic changed sizes
3917,2,2,based on the results plastic type a stretched the least and plastic type b stretched the most therefore the order for the stretchiest plastic polymers is b d c then a the student could have used the same weight on each of the polymer the student could have spesified how much time to allow the weight to pull on the plastics
3918,2,0,based on the data i can see that most of the plastic wraps either stayed the same or increased on the length stretched out i can say the weights did have an impact on how long it stretched out to be overall it was a good experiment w information but there could've been improvements next time i would recommend trying different weights to see if the amount of weight will determined the length also we can add more time to how long the weights stays on the plastic
3919,2,2,i conclude from this lab that plastic type b stretched the most out of all of the polymers this means it has more elasticity than the others i also conclude that plastic type a stretched the least out of all of the polymers this means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers p one way the student could improve the lab is to add more trials that would make the hypothesis more true another way is by deleting human mistake by meaning correctly and things like that
3920,2,2,a after testing and collecting data i compared each result and i it either stretched by 2 to 1 mm each test sometimes it don't move p a by doing more trials and by having the same amount of weight in each one
3921,2,2,a based on the students data i can conclude that plastic b has the most stretchability the data shows that in both trials t1 and t2 plastic b stretched 22 and 23 p b the students could have done another trial to make their data more valid they also could have let the weights hang more than five minutes
3922,2,3,the results from the students polymer lab show that plastic type b stretched furthest in both that's then any other material the students could have improved the experiment by telling how much weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them i f shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp as always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab
3923,2,2,a good conclusion i can make from the data is type a and c were the most alike and types b and d were the most alike for example for t1 type a had 10 and type c had 14 and for t2 type b had 22 and type d had 20 the student could have improved the experimental design by telling the reader how much plastic should be hanging down the table and also he should have been told how heavy the weights were
3924,2,1,based on the student's data the conclusion i have drawn up is that plastic b was the most stretchy in both trial 1 and trial 2 plastic b streched the most out of all the plastics two ways this student could have improved the expirimental design was to have a constant and to add that there are four different types of plastics not just one
3925,2,2,a the conclusion would be that plastic b had the most stretchability while plastic a had the least p b two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials truly good experiment has at least 3 trials another would be to make the procedure more understandable and they should keep the weights on for longer this will give more extensive and accurate data
3926,2,0,based on the data that has been recorded it lists that the second trial that they did with the bags was the trial where the bags were able to hold on to the weights and stretch out the most a way that the students could of have improved their experiment would've been to add more weights and see at how much they would of ripped instead of waiting 5 minutes
3927,2,2,a i came to the conclusion that plastic type b had the most stretchability out of all plastics plastic b was stretched to an average of 33 p b the student could have improved his experimental design by conducting a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involve d in the experiment
3928,2,2,the students found that the weakest polymer is b and the strongest is a on the first trial b stretched 22 mm and on the second trial it stretched 23mm however a was the strongest because on the first that it stretched 10 mm and on the second trial it stretched 12mm without breaking the students could have improved their exprement by being more specific about the different polmers used they could apply the weights onto the plastic instead of the clamps to see how much it dents the plastic and they should do more trials
3929,2,2,all of the plastics stretched plastic a stretched the least plastic b stretched the most p 2 ways the student could of improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial and also saying how much weight was added
3930,2,2,the second trial 2 of the plastic stretched a little more one actually decreased a mm the student should've done it a better way instead of taping it to side of the table also they could've have much weight they were adding to the clamp
3931,2,1,based on the data documented in the table i can conclude that over that plastic type d has the most elasticity because on both trials it stretched to 20mm two ways that the student could have improved the design or validity could have been to specify the amount of the weights being used and specify on what types of plastic to use this would make the validity higher
3932,2,2,based on the data table each trail for each type of plastic was fairly similar also from the table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible as it stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial plastic a was the least flexible the first trial stretched 10mm in length and in the second trial 12mm therefore out of all the plastics plastic b had the greatest stretchability however one way the results could have been improved is by measuring the length mm of the plastic when they break or even after a longer period of time this will show the true stretchability of each plastic another improvement could be naming types of plastic that were being future trial can be done and the best plastic could be put to good use
3933,2,0,a plastic a was 10mm long then it reached out to 12mm plastic b was 22mm then went to 23mm plastic c was 14mm then went to 13mm plastic d was 20mm than stayed the same b one way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples give more details i say the validity is not right because if i want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then i would have gotten something different
3934,2,1,the conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type b did the best out of all of the other plastic types in both trial 1 and 2 also two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the experiment again and to use more plastic types
3935,2,2,in conclusion our hypothesis was widing because plastic type b stretched the most instead of plastic type c p two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the results are they could have included how much weight they put on the clamps and also they could have left the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes
3936,2,3,based on the students data the plastic type b was the plastic with the most stretchability the group could have improved their design by specifying how much weight weighed and kept it constant by having each weight the same also they should have included before and after length in their design table
3937,2,2,a plastic b has most cross linking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest p b the student should have increments in which the weights are added and how much of the plastic should be hanging off the side each plastic should be the same length
3938,2,1,a based on the data shown in the table one strongest type of was plastic b but plastic d had a costant amount of stretch p b one way the student could have improved the experimental design was by including how much weight to add also to compare the results with any other student who performed his same experiment
3939,2,0,b the students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs they could have also improved there expriment by solving the resolts by adding or subtracting
3940,2,2,a with the given data plastic type b has the most stretchability due to its stretches of 22mm and 23mm none of the other plastic types stretched as much plastic d one the closest at 20mm b the student could have improved the validity of the experiment by eliminating a large variable created which has the length of each sample at a constant length also he could have measured the lengths are smaller amounts such as every minute not every 5 minutes
3941,2,3,a based on the students data plastic type b is the 'stretchiest' plastic p b make all original lengths equal i add the same weights undefined in the procedure find a way besides tape to hold the plastic
3942,2,0,a my conclusion is that the expirement was very un organized and not well thought out p b these student could have improved their expiremental design by one telling us the materials they used like what kind of plastic objects they used like whether or not they were strechable just to give us more of a second thought about how theyre data came out they could have organized their data alot better
3943,2,2,i conclude that after seeing the data that plastic type b is the most stretchable out of all the plastics i say this because in trial 1 it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm the plastic that stretched the closist to that was type d which stretched to 20mm both times two ways that they could have improved in labs validity is one adding a third trial to each plastics and two taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type
3944,2,3,a plastic type b stretched the farthest in both trials while plastic type a stretched the least meaning type b was more stretchability than type a p b one way the student could've improved this experiment would be to add a control group so you could see the initial lengths of the plastics another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability
3945,2,3,a plastic type a is stronger than the rest p b there a set length and width for each piece of plastic instead of it being whatever it happens to be a different size may mean a difference in durability and strength
3946,2,0,a based on the data table plastic type a had the most amount stretched so it is the stretches p b one thing they could have done was add weight and see which one would rip faster another thing they could of done was add more time
3947,2,3,a i conclude that plastic b is the strongest with an average stretch length of 22 5 mm plastic a is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm plastic d is the second stretchiest with an average of 20 mm and plastic c is the third with 13 5 mm as the average p b 1 they could have had a constant beginning plastic length p 2 they could have had a standard weight of the weight and tried stretching with heavier or lighter weight for a 3rd trial to see how the weight affects the polymer
3948,2,3,plastic b stretched the most out of all of the plastics to improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test should make a specific length for the plastic
3949,2,0,in conclusion t2 was mostly longer than t1 because t2 had more higher measure than t1 one way this student could of improve is he could of put heaver weights another was he could of done it was he kept reducing the tape size
3950,2,3,based on the students data plastic b stretched the most with 22 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for trial 2 these students could have improved in a lot of things first off they could have been more specific in their experimental design they could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was they could have also added more trials to get a better result
3951,2,3,conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type b improvements they could of had more than one two trials and they could have added the original lengths of the plastic in their results to know that all the plastics were the same length
3952,2,1,the conclusion that b is the strechiest and a is the least two way's the student could have made his experiment better was test the dip is the plastics and the width
3953,2,2,based on the data we descovered that plastic type b stretched the most after 5minutes of the weights on it with a total of 23mm stretched p two ways the students could have improved the experimental design was to add x amount more weight to the plastic to see how much it stretched the other way would be to have one or two more trials to eliminate any chance of errors
3954,2,3,a plastic type b was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in t1 and 23mm in t2 plastic type a was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for t2 and 12mm for t2 p b one way to improve the experiment would have been to add a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants the plastic starting length weights added and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials
3955,2,3,a plastic type b is the most stretchable with an average of 22 5mm of stretchability the least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2 5mm less than type b of 20mm p b the student could have specified a single starting length for each trial of each type of plastic p the student could have specified the weight to add
3956,2,1,well fro 1 they could have named the plastics the second way is to name why they are doing it and finally they could have measure it was before they started testing
3957,2,0,t2 had stretched more than trial t1 for plastic type a b then is was lower than t1 then plastic type d was exactly the sam
3958,2,1,a i can conclude from the students data table that plastic type b had the most stretchibility the weakest type of polymer was type a p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was leave the weights on for longer than five minutes or done more trials
3959,2,1,a plastic type a stretched the most 2mm and type d did not stretch at all p b all plastics started at the same length make sure the temperature is the same
3960,2,1,polymer type c was the strongest plastic with only a difference or 1mm in two trials this student could've listed the starting length of the plastic
3961,2,3,according to the student's data plastic b stretched the most with an average of 22 5mm plastic d was the second most flexible because it stretched an average of 20mm while plastic c was the third most flexible plastic because it stretched an average of 13 5mm lastly plastic a stretched the least with an average of 11mm however these results are not valid in order to make them valid the students would need to use plastics that are the same length and use the same weight to stretch this would ensure valid results because it would be guaranteed the same size plastic was being pulled with the same forces
3962,2,3,a my conclusion would be that plastic b stretched the most because it had the farthest length's both times p b they should have put weights to make the weight even on the other side they should've also done more trials on the other types of wrap
3963,2,2,3 a plastic type b stretched out the most between the two trials with plastic type d coming on close p b the students could've made a third trial to be more valid or allow the weights to hang more than 5 min instead it could've been 10 min
3964,2,1,a according to this investigation the shorter the plastic is the more it will stretch p the experiment is not very valid due to the following we are not aware of what each plastic type is also more trials should have been done so you could have more of a comparison between each trial two trials is not enough
3965,2,0,two ways could have been improved is by doing group and they needed a hypothesis to know wether their question was right or wrong s conclusion is the plastic type a and d there used because they might have putten more weights on different types for the second trial
3966,2,2,a conclusion about this students data is plastic type b stretched the most two ways the student could have improved the design or validity of results is they should have said if the weights had to be the same mass they could have also told the type of tape to use because some tapes hold up more heavier things than other types do
3967,2,1,3 a plastic a and c have very similar inatups based on the amount they stretched and likewise with plastic b and d p b the entire procedure is vague and contains no actual numbers one way they could have improved would be if they specified the amount of weight they used to get this results they got and the way just to help the people trying to reperform this experiment this experiment would would be to specify which platics are done at which time
3968,2,2,in conclusion to plastic that had the most stretchability was plastic a it is the most flexible because the changed the most from trial 1to trial 2 it changed by 2mm the student could have improved on there experiment by adding more trials to increase validity and compare the plastic from before the weights were put on we don't know the length of the plastic at first or how much weight they used
3969,2,2,a plastic b d on the second trial had the most stretch than the other plastic a c p b by doing it 3 times instead of 2 trial and showing the difference for example b on the the second trial stretched more than d by 3
3970,2,2,a a conclusion that i can draw from the students data is that plastic type b stretched the most and plastic type a stretched the least p b two ways the students could have improved their experimental design is one they should have stated what four types of plastic they were using secondly they should have said the amount of weights they put on the clamp
3971,2,2,a in conclusion plastic b was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial p b could have had 3 trials also could have under control
3972,2,2,a plastic type b stretched the most and plastic type a stretched the least p b the student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times he also could have done more trials with each type of plastic
3973,2,3,according to the results shown on the table i can conclude that the plastic type b is the most stretchable type b stretched the most at 23 mm type d stretched 20mm while type c stretched 14mm type a only stretched 12 mm there are many ways that the group could have improved their design one thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps this would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results
3974,2,1,a plastic b was definitely the most stretchy and of all the plastics p b he could have recorded how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time maybe every minute he also could have tested both plastics each to back the same way twice in 3 trials
3975,2,1,a plastic type b had the most stretchability p to improve the valedity of the results the students could have measured the plastic 2 times on each trial
3976,2,2,as the type of plastic changed from type a all the way to type d the amount of stretch increased from 10mm to 23mm p they could increase the amount of trials and make all plastics starting length the same
3977,2,3,a in conclusion plastic type b was stretched the farthest for both trials and plastic type a had the least amount of stretching p b the students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials and tell us the specific amount of weight used for each plastic
3978,2,2,based on the students data plastic type d has the most sretchability to validate the results the students could have done a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic they could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane
3979,2,0,two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results the first would be to figure out what kind of plastic and then write it down on the date table the second way would be to write down the average of the t1 and t2 a conclusion based on the student's data is which plastic stretched the most
3980,2,3,a overall plastic type b had the most stretchability amongst all of them p b 1 done more trials to compare with results b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct
3981,2,3,this polymer investigating lacks numerical data i can lab make a solid conclusion p the students can improve the late by saying the original length of the plastic and the ending length they can also say how much weight they are using and what plastics they are using
3982,2,2,the student did a good job conducting this experiment there was an indepent variable the type of plastic and there were multiple trials the weakest plastic was b because it stretched the most and the strongest was a because it stretched the least p one way the student could have improved this experiment would be by using the same amount of weight that was stretching the plastic another way could be by drawing a line on the plastic so they would measure it in the same spot start and end
3983,2,2,a in conclusion it clear to see by looking at the data that plastic type b has the most stretchability p b the students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results if they would state that they used the same types of weights for each plastic in addition they should have documented the length of type of plastic before beginning the procedure
3984,2,1,a plastic type a had the highest stretchability while plastic type d had the lowest stretchability p b 1 say the exact measure of the plastic sample in step 1 to make them all the same so that the starting mm of the plastic would be a constant p 2 have a control group one piece of plastic that did not have a clump on the bottom edge
3985,2,2,the conclusion would be that type b plastic streched the most for both trial one and two type d made no change it streched the same amount for both trials one way they could have fix their experiment was record what the length of the plastic was before the strech and the change of it another one was to explain the different types of plastics were
3986,2,2,a plastic type b shows the most stretchability because t2 it stretched 22 and t2 it stretched 23 plastic type d stretched 20mm in t1and t2 plastic type c went from 14mm in t1 to 13mm in t2 lastly plastic a went from 11mm in t1 to 10mm in t2 this shows that plastic b is the most stretchable p b the students could have shown the initial weigh of the materials and should have had the material on start of the same length
3987,2,2,based on the student's data i can conclude that plastic type b was the most stretchable p a way that the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 3 or 4 trials instead of 2 also by letting the plastics hang for 5 minutes but also 10 minutes
3988,2,0,from the data of this lab i can infer that in the second trial plastic types a and b both stretched farther than they did in the first trial and type c didn't stretch as much as if did in the first trial and type d stretched evenly with what it stretched the first trial two ways they could have made this procedure better is by doing the experiment on the same surface and by having the same person conducting the experiment in both trials
3989,2,2,the polymer that has the most stretchability was plastic type b with 22 mm for the first trail and 23 for the second plastic type a had10 and 12 type c had 14 and 13 type d had 20 and 20 one way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails
3990,2,1,overall plastic type a stretched the most therefore it must be weaker than the others one way this experiment could be improved is saying repeat experiment for plastics b c and d they did not mention other plastics another way their experiment could be improved is that the students could add another trial to prove their results correct
3991,2,2,a conclusion i can draw for the stretchability for polymer plastics is that for plastic type b the stretchability must be real stretchy because for the t1 it was 22mm and for t2 it was 23mm but for type c it stretchability went down t1 14mm and t2 13mm p the students could of improved the design by adding a t3 also they could of used more than just four different types of plastics
3992,2,1,that each plastic bag does strean a little bitt why he could of improved is how much weight he put on it he could disol use differnt type of clamps one last thing he could of changed is how light he hung the bags from the floor
3993,2,0,based on the student's data plastic tube ''d'' stretched the most for t1 and t2 both trys was the same number 20 plast type a for t1 and t2 has the lowst stretch amount
3994,2,1,a mt conclusion based on the students data is that plastic b had the more affect for its stretchability plastic a had the least stretchability when it comes to the weights of clamps on top of the bag p b two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by including what types of plastic and how long do we leave the weights on top of plastic
3995,2,3,based on the students data plastic a was streched the least at an average of 11mm plastic b streched the least at an average of 27 5m after that came a plastic d with 20mm followed by plastic c at 13 5mm the student could have improved the experimental design and its validity by doing a 3rd trial also the student could have stated whether or not the plastics started off at a constant length for all u
3996,2,1,they could of repeat all the steps over
3997,2,3,a conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is plastic type b is more stretchable than the others because in t1 it stretched 22mm and t2 it stretched 23 the other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic b two ways the students could've improved the experimental design and or validity of the results is did a third trial and measure how far the plastic was on the edge of the table
3998,2,3,a in conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type b at 22 and 23mm the plastic that stretched the least was plastic type a at 10 and 12mm p b one way to improve this experiment is to add constants like how many weights and how much do they weigh also they should do another trial and then average out the results
3999,2,2,a in conclusion plastic type b is a better polymer plastic for stretchability due to the fact that the first trial is stretched 22mm and the second trial it stretched 23mm the polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type a the first trial is stretched 10mm and the second trail it stretched 12mm p b one way they could have improved this experimental design would be by adding a certain ammount of weight and another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control
4000,2,3,based on the student results i can conclude that plastic type b is the most stretchable in the data plastic type b stretched to 22 mm on t1 and 23mm in t2 none of the other plastics had stretched as much then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics
4001,2,2,a a conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that plastic type b has the most stretchability b 2 ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much weight to put on the clamps and the types of plastics used
4002,2,2,a plastic type a stretches longer than all other types in other words it has more stretchability types b c have the same stretchability and d has the least stretchability had the least durability kepping it's structure while the others did not p b 1 made all the types start out in the same length 2 specified the amount of weight that was applied 3 recorded the length of the sample before stretching it
4003,2,2,based on the students data some of the plastic stretched some stayed the same and one of them even got smaller one way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size another way they could improve this is by saying how much weight they put on and keep the weight the same for all
4004,2,3,a based on the student's data plastic type a is the least stretchable while plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic types b and c fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability b was more stretchable than c p b one way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths rather than simply measuring what their length already was the student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample
4005,2,1,a plastic type d seems to be more accurate of stretchability because after both trials t1 and t2 the amount stretched is the same at 20 mm p b one the experiment could be proved is to repeat the experiment a second way is to make an hypothesis before starting the experiment
4006,2,1,a is not much of diference of t1 to t2 is only 1 or 2 mm so is really acuret b they shouded have more plastic type and more trials
4007,2,2,a a conclusion that can be made is that they used plastic b then plastic b will stretch the most p b more trials and use more plastic types
4008,2,2,the conclusion i draw to this investigation is plastic type b as the most stretchability compared to all the others and plastic a as the least stretchability p two ways the student could've improved this experiment would be a clearing with the for example how much weight and also mention what type of materials needed to conduct this experiment
4009,2,2,well as we see on
4010,2,0,the conclusion it draws from this is that they
4011,2,1,plastic type b was the stretchiest plastic type it listatcched a total of 45 mm plastic type d was second it stretched a total of 40 mm plastic c was the 3rd stretchiest it stretched a total of 27 mm and plastic a was the least stretched it stretched a total of 22 mm
4012,2,2,conclusion the stretchability of a type plastic is dependent on what type of polymer it is plastic a and b were clearly strong than plastic c d most likely they were made of very different polymers p the students could have improved their design by specifying the weight and using the same weight and clamps every time this would ensure more precision
4013,2,3,a a conclusion i can draw by looking at the student's data is that the type b plastic stretched the most after the two trials p b the two ways these student could have improved their was by added more trial also they should have established a starting length of the plastic
4014,2,2,a in conclusion plastic b was the most stretchable at an average of 2200mm while plastic a was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm p b the student could have known the weight of the clamps and add that on to the amount of weight added also they could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic
4015,2,2,a plastic type b stretched most d second most c third most and a stretched the least making b the most stretchable and a the least b one way to improve the experimental design and or validity is to tell which types of plastics they used another is to tell how much weight they added in the clamp
4016,2,2,plastic type b was the weakest and stretches the most a way to improve the experiment would be to designate what each type of plastic is and how much weight to use on the clamp
4017,2,2,a after reviewing the data i have figured out that plastic type b for both trials 1 2 the plastic stretched the longest trial 1 22mm trial 2 23mm plastic type b is the least change b 2 ways they could of improved there experiment is do a control with all plastic types with the same weight for all of them also they could of hangeach plastic for different lengths of time do 2 trials one of 5mins 1 of 10
4018,2,1,based on the students data after putting the weights over clamps the amount of stretchability decreased and the difference the between the trials went down one by one students could of improved the experimental design by weighing the weights and calculating how much preasure would be on the clamps they also could of said the specific plastic samples they were using
4019,2,2,a based on the data show plastic type b was the stretchiest material and plastic type a is the least b in there data table they could have given how much weight was appiyed the the material in the procedure the students could have been more specific on the unite used and elaborated more on performing the procedure to make it easier for the next person to use it and under stand
4020,2,1,a on the trial a b c and d stretched quiet long and plastic b is the most longest so plastic b is the best from all on the second trial the result is not a lot difference from the first trial plastic a b and c stretched 1 2 mm more and plastic d still the same b students should put the original measurement for all the plastics and put in the data table the students should leave the weights on the clamp to hang there longer than 5 minutes to see if those plastics could stretched even more
4021,2,0,the students sould had said what type of plastic they used and if they were the same and say what was the main reason for us to no how much a the plastic streched
4022,2,3,a a conclusion that could be drawn based on the students data is that plastic type b can stretch the most with t1 being 22mm and t2 being 23 and plastic type a stretching the shortest with t1 at 10mm and t2 at 23mm p b the student should have made sure that all plastics strips are the same length and the student should have tape all the stips in the same spot
4023,2,3,plastic type b stretched the longest out of plastic a c and d on the first try streching 22mm and the second time streching 23mm to make the experiment better the student should have done the experiment a couple more times because plastic type d streched 20mm both times the second way he or she could make it better is by telling how much weight he added on the clamp
4024,2,3,a according to the student's results type b plastic was longer in length and stretchable plastic a seemed to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of 10 12 mm p b the student could have been to say how much weight to put in the clamp so it could be a constant variable also the student could have put the initial length of the plastic with the results to see which plastic had stretched the most
4025,2,1,a after time the maximum stretch of a palmer goes down and becomes stronger p b he could of made the laties longer of tell how much waits you were adding
4026,2,3,a based on the finding the stretchiest plastic is type b stretching 22mm in t1 and 12mm in t2 the least stretchy would be type a stretching 10mm in t1 and 12 in t2 p b 1 they needed to specify the size of the plastic samples for example 3in 5in if they weren't all the same size the results would be inaccurate 2 they also needed to specify the weight without it one sample could stretch more having 10 pounds on it than on sample with only 2 porkets on it
4027,2,3,in conclusion plastic type b had stretched the farthest the two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis a way this student could have improved this was by telling us how what the original measurement the plastic type was therefore we could see how much it's stretched i think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid
4028,2,1,a i conclude that the it plastics tested showed some increased in length when stretched i believe that the plastics way that they were stretched increased in length over to me that what i found in this experiment p b i believe they should have identify the different plastics i also believe that they should of said how much weight the plastic was holding and many that what should of been added
4029,2,2,with the data recorded i know that plastic type b is the most it stretchable of the four plastics type i tested p it would of been wise to state what the plastics were for and how much the weight's weighed
4030,2,0,the student is conclusion is a student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability and the two ways the student could is the student not talk procedure polymer and attach a clean to the bottom edge on the plastic sample
4031,2,0,in conclusion in the 1st trial all of the plastics here higher in the second trial plastic a increased by 2mm plastic b increased by 1mm plastic c increased by 1mm and plastic d stayed the same i believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic
4032,2,2,a plastic type b was the most stretchable plastic used because it was stretched longer than any other plastic in both trials plastic type a had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial and 12mm for the second p the student could have improved his her experiment by keeping these two variables constant would make the experiment very reliable
4033,2,0,in the second trial the length for plastic a and b went up for plastic c the longer length was 14 in the first trail but in plastic d the amount stretched stood exactly the same two ways the student could have improve this experimental design is drawing a line graph and give the data table a little more details
4034,2,2,a based on the students data i've concluded that plastic b was the stretched plastic p b the student could have improved the design by adding a control group and adding more trials
4035,2,2,in conclusion plastic type d stretched the most out of the samples plastic a on the other hand was the least stretchable p the student could've specified the types of plastics they were testing they also should have specified the amount of weight they were adding to the clamp they didn't say how to measure the length of the plastic types
4036,2,1,based on the students data i can conclude plastic type b was the stretchiest polymer the students could have improved there experimental design by telling us the type of polymer plastics they used and they should have indicated in the graph how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out
4037,2,2,overall plastic a is the most durable plastic b was the weakest in both tests they could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data they could have added more weight in the second trial
4038,2,0,the conclusion im gonna draw based on the students data is that there amount of stretched mm could go up if they keep investigating two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results is that first take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its lenght and second repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples
4039,2,2,the amount that plastic type a stretched was 10mm on the first trial and 12mm on the second trial plastic type b stretched 22mm then 23mm the second time plastic type c stretched 14mm first and 13mm second plastic type d stretched 20mm both times to improve this lab they could have made one more trial averaged the 3 results they could also specify on the weights they were using to make the results more interesting
4040,2,3,a based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type a stretched the least it is the strongest of the four because it only stretched an average of 11mm averaged from the two trials while b's average stretch was 22 5mm c's average stretch was 13 5 and c's average was 20mm b they should have specified the amount of weight they should have specified the size and shape of the plastic
4041,2,3,a plastic type b stretched the most with 22 23 mm and plastic type a stretched the least with 10 12 mm p b two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by having all of the plastics being the same length in the beginning and adding a certain amount of weights not just saying ''add weights''
4042,2,0,the student could of improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample
4043,2,2,a i can conclude that this experiment was not valid this student only had two trials instead of three p b this prolect could have been valid if the student had three trials and if they had kept their controlled group constant
4044,2,2,a plastic type b stretched the most because it stretched an average of 22 5 mm plastic type a streached the least because it streached an average of 11mm plastic type c and d are in the midle p b add weights to the clamp before they put it on the plastic specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic
4045,2,1,a a conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type a produced the most amount of stretching from trial 1 to trial 2 10mm to 12mm compared to all the other plastic types however plastic type d remain the same and on one of the plastuc types c the amount it stretched decrease from 14 to 13 p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the result are instead of using one type of plastic they should have used various types to broad the results also the student could have done more trials
4046,2,3,a based on the students data i conclude that plastic type a was the least stretched out and that plastic type b was the most p b two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results is by one keeping the amount of weight added to each type of plastic constant and two making sure that the weight of the clamp was subtracted
4047,2,0,plastic type a was the only type of plastic that stretched the most the student could of improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices also they could of used heavier weights
4048,2,1,the students could have impared the experiment by doing the amount many times to check if it was accurate
4049,2,1,a a conclusion based on the students data is that the stronger the plastic that they use is the harder it is to stretch for example sample a and c must be thicker because it stretched less p b two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by actually putting the same amount of weight on each and by saying the names
4050,2,2,polymer b is the most stretchable plastic p the improve the experiment the student could have massed the weight used in step 4 to use the same amount of weight to the plastics in the second trial than the first trial
4051,2,3,based on the students data results plastic type d stretched the most plastic type a stretched the least two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are that they should of measured how long each piece of plastic was before they added the weights so they can know how much the plastic stretched also they should of used the same amount of weights
4052,2,1,a according to my results plastic type b had the greatest amount stretched with 22mm in trial one and in trial 2 with 23mm i would rely on plastic type b to hold my things p b 1 st way the student's could have made theire results validity better one instead of putting plastic type a b c d they should have labeled them by what plastic they were 2 nd the students should have seen how far the plastic could stretch before breaking
4053,2,3,a in conclusion plastic type b had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two plastic type a had stretched the least amount in both trials p b the students could have added how many weights they put on the plastic and how much each weight weighed they should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched
4054,2,3,conclusively plastic type b tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples p 1 there is no control in the starting length of the plastics different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results p 2 the amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant plastic type b which stretched the longest could have had more weight on it than the others
4055,2,3,a conclusion on could draw is that plastic type b has the most stretchability a student could improve the design and results by adding more trials and specifying how much weight should be added these two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design
4056,2,0,a based on the data plastic a c shows a decrease of 1 or 2 mm of stretch plastic ''d'' is a reasonable plastic to be used as stretchability p there's no need for improvement for the experiment design or results
4057,2,1,based on the students data plastic type a and b in trial 2 did better than trial 1 but c d of trial did better than trial 2 one way the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to measure how can the table was that the weigh were hanging off the plastic with another way the could've done better was to test the trial again to see more results
4058,2,0,b we need material they are plastic tape clamp it shows that it was the lab of polymer plastics p hypothesis if we attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample then1 weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes and remove the weight measure the length of the plastic because repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastics
4059,2,3,plastic type b was the most stretchable it stretched on average 22 5 mm while the others did not stretch past 20 mm the student could have improved the experiment as design by including the averages and using 3 trials instead of one also if one made all the plastics the same length one could accurately determine which was the most stretchable
4060,2,1,a after testing this experiment the results show that plastic sample d stretched the most mm making it the weakest plastic plastic type a appeared to have streched the least amount of mm making it the strongest plastic b the students could have made this experiment more valid by adding a controlled group they could have also done a trial in order to increase the validity of their experiment
4061,2,3,a we can conclude that plastic b is the most stretchable from all the types but the lab is not valid because judging by the results the lab was not done the same for each trial p b two way to improve this lab are have s or third trials at least state the weight of the product used to put on the plastic materia
4062,2,2,a one conclusion i have fro this data was that plastic d was the weakest and stretched the most p b one way they could have improved this expirement is to make sure all sample sizes are the same length and making a change if they arent another way is by specifiying how much weight to add to the clamp at the bottom of the ample
4063,2,0,3 the second trial 12 is not exactly the same as the first trial 11 cause in the second trial even 1 type plastic goes up but on stays the same they could of improved the experiment design by make sure every thing is in order make sure to every type of plastic samples you do the same to it
4064,2,2,a i have concluded that based on the students data that plastic type stretched the most amount of millimeters and plastic type a stretched the least amount of millimeters p b two ways the experimental design could have been improved are that a control should have been added to that experimental off at and include how much weight was added to the clamp
4065,2,2,plastic type b stretchable most 22mm in t1 23mm in t2 plastic a stretched the least at only 10mm t1 and 12 mm t2 this experiment isn't exactly valid however because stretching the material 2 times usually makes it stretchier the second trial hence the mm stretched in t2 was usually greater for all 4 plastics instead you should have 2 of each plastic to onsure validity also they could have had a trial 3 to see the results came at the same
4918,3,1,china's panda and australia's koala are two animals that arent predator pandas eat bamboo and koala's eat eucalyptus leaves therefore they are harmless they are both different from pythons because pythons are potentialy dangerous considering they can swallow an entire alligator you could conceivably have pythons shacking upto the potomac
4919,3,1,pandas and koalas are similar because they are both described as specialist animals because they only eat one food exclusively no change the panda and koala bears a different from the pythons because because pythons are generalist animals that migrate and can adapt to the climates in the lower states while the panda and koala bears cannot
4920,3,1,pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they both only feed on one thing pandas eat bamboo and koalas eucalyptus leaves unlike pythons which eat just about everything including aligators
4921,3,2,pandas in china only eat bamboo and koalas in australia eat exclusively eucalyptus leaves they are both restricted to one food while pythons eat a varity of foods potentially harming native species
4922,3,0,pandas in china and koalas from australia are similar because they are both specialist they both are different from a python because a python is a generalist
4923,3,0,panda's are similar to koala's because they are both specialists and a python is a generalist
4924,3,2,panda's are similar to koala's by they are both specialist species they only survive in certain conditions they are not able to adapt very well and can only eat and live in certain climates they are both different form pythons by they are not reptiles also a python is a generalist specie and can easily adapt to change they eat a variety of foods and accept change
4925,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they both are specialist in the article it states that koala bears pandas eat mainly one type of food koalas eat eucalyptus leaves while pandas eact bamboo they are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists and like stated in the article they can adapt to anything
4926,3,1,pandas and koalas are similar because they eat mainly one type of food for them pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves they differ from a python because pythons can eat just about anything one even attempted an alligator
4927,3,1,pandas are similar to koalas due to their very much a like eating habitsthey both eat bamboo and occasional bugs pythons on the other hand aren't mammals like pandas koalas eat mostly rodents
4928,3,2,a panda from china and a koala from australia are very simmilar because they are both specialists panda's only eat bamboo and koalas exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves this shows that they are unable to adopt unlike a python whose habitat in asia is simmilar to those in about a third of the continental united states
4929,3,1,pandas and koalas are similar in that they are both endangered and they eat mostly one thing china's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or australia's koala bears which eats almost eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively achenbach 5 these two are different from pythons because pythons will eat almost any thing
4930,3,1,a china panda eats almost nothing but bamboo koalas bear eat eucalyptus leaves those two animals are similar because they both eat a food amount of leaves or something that is green those two animals are different from pythons because pythons hurt and wrap their pray around them panda's and koala bears stay in rain forests pythons you will mostly catch them in an hot enviroment
4931,3,0,the pandas in china eat nothing but bamboo and australia's koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves almost every day mammals like a panda and a koala bear are warm and fuzzy while animals such as snakes and pythons are less well respected or supported which koala bears and pandas are different from pythons
4932,3,1,panda's and koalas are both similar because they are specialist they need a very specific climate to live or they will die pythons differ from these two animals because pythons are generalist pythons have a much broader range that they can survive in
4933,3,2,a panda and a koala beer are similar because they both eat one type of food a panda eats bamboo and a koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves they are also both specialists but a python is a generalist meaning they can adapt to their surroundings pandas and koala beers can't adapt
4934,3,1,pandas and koalas are similar because they need special environment and food to live while pythons don't to show the relationship between these creatures mac innes explains what favors generalists is change what favors specialists is stability in other words pandas and koalas need stability to thrive while pythons doesn't
4935,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are their specialist pythons are generalists which are the complete offer to pandas and koalas the text states ''a generalist is a raccoon a python a cockroach a white tailed deer a specialists is china's panda or australia' koala '' the specialists are the peaceful creatures that keep to themselves and generalists are the destructive creatures that are harmful and dangerous this is just like a house cat compared to lion or a dog compared to wolf
4936,3,1,china's panda is similar to australia's koala because in the article it states that the panda only eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves constantly they both only eat one thing and are different from pythons because they eat multiple things not plants and are more vicious
4937,3,2,pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they are both specialist species they both require specific resources and climate to survive these limits them to only their natural habitats this makes pandas and koalas much different than pythons pythons are generalists and can survive in many different places that is why pythons are being found naturally in florida but not koalas or pandas
4938,3,1,pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they both are exclusively eating one food ''a specialist is china's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively ''but they are different from pythons because pythons eat a much more vast assortment
4939,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they eat plants only the pandas eat nothing but bamboo and as for the koalas they eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively they're both different then pythons because its a generalist
4940,3,1,pandas and koalas eva fogh they live in different of the world are still very alike the one thing they share the most is their food they both only practicly eat one thing for the panda its bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves both these two animals are very dfferent than a python that has no legs and eats anything
4941,3,2,a panda beer is similar koala to a koala bear because they both only eat one food for the most part pandas eat bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves but a python is a more diverse and invasive animal i eats a broader range of things from smaller reptile to amphibians
4942,3,0,pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they both eat food from nature for example pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves the difference between the two koala and panda from a python is the different environments they live in for example the pythons lives along the canals of cape coral pandas and koalas live near forest
4943,3,1,china's panda and australia's koala bear are both specialists while pandas eat nothing but bamboos and koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively phython's a generalist according to the oraicle we live in an age that favors generalist rather than specialists and other generalists are best in and around humans

5309,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because of the limited food that they eat pandas almost only eats bamboos and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves they both are different from pythons because pythons are heavy meat eaters and pandas and koalas are vegitarian
5310,3,2,pandas in china and koalas in australia are different from pythons because they need specific things to survive the pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala bear only eats eucalyptus leaves this means that these animals are very exclusive but a python can adapt almost where the climate is right for example it can even adapt herein the u s the difference is that a python is a generalist and koalas and pandas are specialists
5311,3,2,pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they are both specialist they both usually only eat one kind of food bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas if these animals were taken from their food source chances are they would die this is not like pythons however pythons when given a mild to warm climate to live in will adapt to the in surrounding and food would not a factor as long as there are animals in their environment pythons will have food however pythons for the moment are not suitable fro colder climates
5312,3,1,pandas are similar to koalas because both eat leaves almost exclusively they're different to pythons because pythons eat anything according to the text ''a python swallowed an alligator '' in other words pandas and koalas are not something to really worry about unlike pythons
5313,3,1,the way the chinease panda and the australian koalas are alike is because they only eat one sorce of food pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves on the other hand pythons eats mostly anything and everything it can
5315,3,1,well because china panda they don't eat almost nothing just bamboo and koala just eat eucalyptus so that is a food that they can jus find in their own ecosistem but in the case of the pythons they can eat almos everything like rats cows chicks eggs etc
5316,3,1,pandas in china are different from australia's koala bear because of what they eat as the article says china's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves they are both harmful though pythons are different because they eat other animals
5317,3,1,china's pandas and australian koalas are similar it that they are both specialists the pandas and koala eat almost nothing but bamboo arole eucalyptus respectively unlike pythons which are generalists pythons can adapt to a wide variety of habitats and fond sounds
5318,3,1,in the article it is stated that python is a generalist species while a panda or a koala is a specialist what this means is that specialists clearly need an environment that they have fully developed too so they can survive the need for bamboo and eucalyptus leaves whereas pythons can survive anywhere as long as there is some temp influence on them and that is the difference
5319,3,1,pandas in china and koalas in australia are both harmless a specialist is china pandas which eat almost nothing but bamboo or australia koala bear wich eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively but python is dangerous a python swallowed in alligator and there's not a deinate way to put it explosed
5320,3,0,pandas and koalas are similar because they live in a hot enviorment they both only eat one thing panda eats bambo and a koala eats eucalyptus they are both different from pythons because you can use them as pets but a panda and a koala you can't because they are almost extinct
5321,3,0,the pandas and the koalas are similar because they are both animals that are forcing and that are harmless unlike the python which is a deadly venerous snake the panda and koalas are left alone in there habitats while the viable snakes python are brought to the u s in the story it says how the panda only eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves meaning they are herbavores
5322,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in astralia because they are both specialists that eat only one type of food china's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo they are different from a python is a generalist
5323,3,1,pandas and koalas are similar because they eat bamboo bamboos panda and eucalyptus leaves koala they are both different from pythons because they are not vicious and attacking creatures they are gentle whereas a python is vicious and fierce looking always ready to attack a python can even eat an alligator
5324,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both part of the specialist species a panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and a koala eats almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves because of this they differ from pythons which are part of the generalist species pythons can live in many places and they do well around humans
5325,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialists like it says in the article china's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves these both are different from pythons because like the article says pythons are a generalist
5326,3,1,pandas tend to eat nothing but bamboo they relate to koalas in australia because koalas eat one specific food exclusively as well eucalyptus pandas and koalas are both different from pythons because they are more prone to survive in almost any climate while pandas live specifically in china and koalas in australia pythons are more abundant
5327,3,1,china's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo the koala eats eucalyptus leaves they both don't eat meat pythons eat almost anything a python swallowed an alligator as said in the article pandas and koalas eat plants and pythons can eat anything
5328,3,2,as stated in the story koalas and pandas are specialist species or species that can only live in one area because their main source of food can only be found there they differ from pythons because pythons could live in a range of areas and still be able to hunt for food
5329,3,2,the pandas and the koala bear are alike because they aren't eating people or other animals pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves they are also alike because they are specialist pandas and koalas are different from pythons because a python is a generalist and pythons are viewed as a threat to society they are dangerous and eat other animals and possibly humans
5330,3,2,pandas and koalas are similar to pandather because the are exclusive to their habitats pandas only live in china because of the bamboo and koalas line in australia because they only eat the eucalyptus leaves both are different from pythons because pythons can adapted to different enviornments and food an example would be how the pythons were introduced to florida
5331,3,1,pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar in many ways like it states in the passage china's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively meaning that the two animals can live off eating one thing they are different from pythons because unlike pythons pandas and koala bears are not household pets
5332,3,1,pandas and koalas are the same because they're both specialists each of them eats almost nothing but bamboo or eucalyptus leaves which is also what makes them specialists as stated in paragraph 21

5334,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koala's in australia because they both eat one specific food that their habitat has on the story it said pandas eat bamboo while koala's eat eucalyptus leaves they are both different from pythons because pythons can't eat only one thing and they are generalists
5335,3,2,panda's and koalas are surprisingly similar species this is because they're specialist they are limited to a particular region of the world because of their diet while pythons are different because they're generalist they can exist in a variety of environments because they can adapt what favors generalists is change what favors specialists is stability achenbanch5 in conclusion pandas and koalas differ from pythons
5336,3,1,pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they are both specialist species they eat almost exclusively one food they are different from a python which is a generalist and eats more than one type of food
5337,3,2,pandas in china are similar to koala in australia because they both only eat food type of food in their natural habitat they are both different from pythons because pythons just need to have the right climate to survive and they will adapt to the different food for example pandas only eat bamboo but a python will eat anything
5338,3,0,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are specialists as they are different from the python because the python is a generalists there are more pythons because the word today favors generalists rather than specialists says one sentence in the article
5339,3,1,from reading this article i can say pandas in china are much like koalas in austrailia because both animals eat mainly one food pandas like to eat mainly bamboo and koalas like to eat mainly eucalyptus leaves this quality puts both animals in the catagory of specialists this differs from python because pythons are generalist the article says generalists are human beings that live anywhere from florida to antarctica to outer space unlike pandas and koalas
5340,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they both need specific foods and substances to survive i know this because the author says ''a specialist is china's panda wich eats almost nothing but bamboo or australia's koala bear wich eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively '' unlike a panda and koala pythons have more options for food ''you could conceivably have pythons snalking their way up the potomac obviasly they differ a lot from pandas and koala
5341,3,2,pandas in china and koalas bears in australia are similar in that they are both specialist species this means they are restricted to limited environments and only eat one type of food as a result these animals are less capable of adapting a python however is much more flexible it is a generalist species better suited for survival it is different also because it can live in different climates and eats different things

8070,4,0,i dont no what the would invasive mean
8071,4,1,the word invasive is significant to this article the author uses the word invasive to describe animals that have immigrated to a new enviornment even the tittle one man's pets another's invasive species is important in this article
8072,4,0,the significance of the word invasive is meaning the meaning of the word so invasive would me different because everytime they use the word its before species like they're introduced i think that 'invasive' is passing judgment or to me its on wonderful introduction i think the word mean different because there are different type of animals
8073,4,1,the word invasive in the article is used in the context of invasive species eliminating other species and invading the native habitats of other animals the article discusses the growing amany of invasive python species and the different viewpoints on how to handle it
8074,4,1,the significance of the word ''invasive'' to the rest of the article is that these animals are not invasive they are being introduced to the u s by people like robray macinnes who import them here to sell on the market
8075,4,0,the word invasive like says in the article mean a animals that passed judgement
8076,4,1,the article focuses on the introduction of the native species of reptiles these intruders are called invasive species because they tend to conquer or take over the new habitat forcing out other native species
8077,4,2,the word invasive is very important to the article and also explains alot about the way the animals act in the area without any natural predators the pythons living in the everglades have nothing to kill them to keep their population down this makes them invasive because they are taking over a once stable environment
8078,4,1,i believe in this article invasive means hidden unchecked or referred to pythons maccinnes uses this word when he states i think that invasive is passing judgement he used this because he in happy that pythons are going birth and the number is increasing where others say its invasive as in this is not a good thing this is how invasive was used
8079,4,1,invasive meaning a foreign species that has made a home somewhere it isn't native to for an example in the article they speaks of how the nile nonnter lead can now be found around cape soral the animal has the word nile in its name its obviously not a native species to florida
8080,4,1,the significance of the word invasive is that the python and other reptiles are coming to areas where they don't belong one man might like the reptile but another man sees that it will backfire on soon harm the habitat it's living in and expand its population causing that habitat its new habitat where it will now live
8081,4,1,invasive means something that invades an area this is important in the article because the main idea is that pythons are an invasive species in the everglades in florida without understanding the word invasive one would not understand the arguements presented by bob roy macinnes or skip show on the positive or negative affects of pythons as invasive species
8082,4,0,the word invasive is very appropriate for almost all of the article arguments in both positive and negative ways some argue that pythons are not invasive while some support with counter arguments that they are not exclusive when it comes to requirements some species are also very invasive and support that the world it is constantly changing
8083,4,0,the significance of the word invasive is passing judgement because in the rest paragraph 7 it says i think that invasive is passing judgement and that's how i think it relates to the story
8084,4,1,in the article one mans pet another' invasive species by joel achenback the word invasive is very significant this is because the python is an invasive species also the article talks about other invasive species a raccoon a python a cockroach a white tailed deer achenback 4 lastly the article corrects invasive with generalist when talking about the five mentioned species
8085,4,1,the significance of invasive is that there is controversy on whether or not these animals are harmful to society and therefore invasive or if they are just being introduced to society and they are not doing anything negative
8086,4,0,the significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article means strange animals have a place in our society our homes with no question in paragraph 7 invasive species is unfair this means that just because their not our everyday animal doesn't mean you can't form a life for them
8087,4,2,the word invasive means intruding invasive species like the python in the everglades are beginning to threat native species they are new animals that threat biodiversity these animals can cause animals to become extinct and are generalist so they can adapt to different environments and affect other people and organism's in and existence
8088,4,1,invassive as to almost coming right up too in this article it is used to devicte a species invading and going were people think it shouldn't be
8089,4,0,the significance of the word invasive is it can be used as a powerful word it can also we used to pass judgement on your thoughts and concerns about a topic according to source two even the term invasive species is unfair he said they're introduced i think that invasive is a good judgement i supose that invasive has a strong meaning behind itself
8090,4,1,the significance of the word invasive is to explain that the animal is invading our home land and people that the animal poses a threat in the article they say that reptiles are invasive species but macinnes says that government overestimate the threat of these species some are cammercially attractive
8091,4,0,i think that the word invasive is like saying people are not supportive of animals like that because not a lot of people own them and when they an see them there scared because they are not being supportive about them
8092,4,1,the significance of the word invasive is that when people hear it to them it sounds dangerous and leathal but it really doesnt means that in the article the author wrote that even the term invasive species is unfair they're introduced so what he saying is that just because someone calls them invasive species doesnt mean thare harmful if kept in controlled environment
8093,4,2,the word invasive plays a very important role in the article biologists such as skip snow claim that these reptilian species of pythons and lizards are invasive this conclusion was reached by their adaptability to multiple environments and disrupting the ecosystems however some such as robray macinnes argue otherwise invasive is the rod of the controversy over these reptiles
8094,4,2,the significance of the word invasive in this article is an animal put into a habitat not its own this animal if a generalist species will affect the habitat badly because it will hurt the ecosystem by killing species that normally another animal would eat the python is described in this article as invasive because it is not their natural habitat
8095,4,1,the significance of the word invasive is like they were sent here but are not ment to be here biologists however say that invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity
8096,4,1,the word invasive is significant to the article because in one part of article it is used in a good sense saying that invasive species are giving a broader look at pets put in other parts of the article it is used in a bad sence stating that the species are taking over too much wit people live in the wild also that the species should stay on their native area
8097,4,0,the significane of the wod invasive is truely meaning a endaged species or animal the articles tittle say that the snake is a pet to some but nether less a wild reptile to others the word refers to basically every paragrah because that what their talking about the word can clearly go towards the whole article
8098,4,1,the word invasive is significant because they informs you that these animals are dangerous and shouldn't be kept as pets because they arent used to the area's they are kept this is why macinnes says they should say introduced instead because its not as bad
8099,4,0,invasive means that the species kind of was introduct to an area the species does not adapt to the new environment
8100,4,1,the word invasive was used in context saying invasive species said by mcinnes i think the word would mean to not belong somewhere but it is a personal opinion the way you feel about it macinnes feels it shouldn't be used because they're being introduced and that it's a passing judgement
8101,4,2,in this article the word invasive means animals that have taken over area unchecked by natural predators that are major threats to biodiversity for example the article says that the pythons in florida are imperiling five endangered species this could lead to an unbalance in the enviroment invasive animals could also stretch their habitat to a larger area
8102,4,0,the significance of the word invasive in the article is big due to the fact that this article mainly talks about invasive animals such as snakes pythons etc also it talks about the animals that are not invasive such as the koala and the panda
8103,4,1,'invasive' is an important word because it perfectly describes the snakes they are extremely invasive in the ways they have spread like in the everglades
8104,4,1,robray macinnes says invasive is the wrong term to use for pythons he says this new concept should be called introducian because they are introducing the best thing to happen to the everglades in the last 200 years
8105,4,1,the word shows that these animals are unwanted and are invading areas and killing almost extinct animals such as a mouse so althogether the article is showing that the word invasive means that these animals such as pythons are invading these areas
8106,4,1,invasive in this article when your refering to species means a cold specie that can be treated as a pet but because of it natural instants can be a threat or dangerous towards you one particular invasive species that is talked about in this article is the python a snake that many people keep as pets but is also a wild specie that is poisonous
8107,4,1,invasive in this article means an animal that has entered into human territory in the article it says trade in nonnative creatures as a factor in the rising number of invasive species such as burmese pythons showing that pythons are invasive animals
8108,4,2,invasive in the context of this article means species such as the burmese python and the nile monitor lizard do not have predators here in the u s to hunt them this is very significant because this means their numbers cannot be kept in check and they might overpopulate complications will ensue without natural barriers for these species
8109,4,1,the significance of the word invasive is used quite often in the story and macinnes thinks it shouldn't be invasive but introducing because invasive is more of a judgement macinnes thinks that not every animal invades property of humans but it introduces themselves to new things in the world
8110,4,1,well the word invasive is kinda like a bad thing because the word invade is similar to the word invasive so i'm thinking that threat invasive species would invade an area that these kinda species don't belong there
8111,4,1,invasive is great word to use for this article the article is talking about the fact of bringing in new animals will create them to make many babies then they will overpopulate
8112,4,0,the word invasive is used in this article to show that animals like the burmese python and the nile monitor lizard are threats although some people may consider them as pets they are extremely dangerous

9786,4,0,the word invasive means that the animal or thing is now it tells about how it can be either good or harmful to allow invasive species into an area the reason why is because macinnes explained that pythons are introduced and invasive is just passing judgement
9787,4,0,invasive to the article means that other species under go a lag before proliferating or multiplying
9788,4,0,the significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is sort of like invasion of these types of reptiles and how us humans are scared of them so we tried to stay away in the article it states a snake like that coming at you you'd leave alone or simply die of fright bearing that if you see one you must leave it more
9789,4,0,invasive is described as not being introduced and that it is too harsh of a word to be used in this contest
9790,4,2,invasive means that a species not native to the particular area it was introduced to overpopulares and causes extinction to other species this is relative to the article because the article talks about how pythons are becoming an invasive species in florida and even endangered the key largo wood rat
9791,4,0,invasive is significant because it implies that reptiles invade your home and are unwanted pests
9792,4,1,the significance of the word invasive is to describe the python in this article what impliedfrom this word has that the snakes aren't oftenly every place there predators who bill are are carry hurt us
9793,4,1,invasive is like when there is a lot of one thing everywhere like pythons are becoming invasive because there are becoming so many more of them as time goes on
9794,4,2,the significant of the word invasive refers to an imbalance to the ecosystem biodiversity is a growing problem which involves a new species in an unfamiliar environment this is a problem as they are not the target of predators and they have many animals to prey on causing populations to be shiffed as the new species spread it can cause more problems for existing species
9795,4,0,the word invasive means unnatural in the article because the article comparing invasive reptiles to natural reptiles they are natural unbreeded reptiles
9796,4,0,invasive means farced because there saying how people started banging in species to new places and macinnes says of being forced there being introduced
9797,4,1,the significance of the word invasive is that this means species are being spread around at a high rate this article explains the danger of it including examples of pythons spreading across the u s and eating different animals killing them all
9798,4,0,the significance of the word invasive is to show us the reader that this reptiles are a strong group of reptiles very dangerous than others
9799,4,1,invasiveis significant to the rest of this article because it is how more specialist and uncommon animals are classified people say that invasive species are major threats to biodiversity achenbach this article describes how these invasive animals are making an impact on how life on earth has never moved this fast
9800,4,2,the term invasive means or species of plants or animals that is introduced to or new environment that thrive and take over the invasive species invade and aren't imbalance in ecosystems in the article invasive is being used to describe the pythons because they are not native to north america yet they are continuing to multiply and are growing they are moving northward and hold a potential threats to more northern ecosystem an could cause problems
9801,4,1,in the article invasive refers to a species that come to be invading an area however certain people think that the word is to harsh and instead say that they're being introduced also the article states that invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity this is referring to the pythons in the us they are quickly changing peoples and other animals habitats the article states that people think those invasive pythons came and were swept up when a hurricane occurred
9803,4,2,the word invasive is significance to the article because it is the article the article is based in the idea that some exotic pets like pythons may escape in the wild and become an invasive species causing a threat to the local environment and biodiversity the article also provides some example 2 invasive specie and their effect as well pythons alligators in 1992 that earth proliferating spread of pythons within a year
9805,4,1,the word invasive shows that pythons rattlesnakes and other reptiles weren't originally and naturally found in the united states people brought them here and residents buy them since it's a very effective threat display these species are foreign and the article explains what will happen if they continue to live in this foreign environment
9806,4,1,the word invasive is significant to the rest of the article because it is describing what animals take over enviroments and adapt easily for example paragraph 12 states that the pythons went native in florida just by the fact that pythons are now native in florida means that they can adapt fast
9807,4,1,the significance of invasive is passing judgement in paragraph 9 biologist say that invasive species unchecked by nataral predators are major threats to biodiversity

11523,5,0,the mrna goes through the dividing wall and into the trna and into a section of the dna it then goes to the amino acids and create a protein
11524,5,1,translation moving out of the nucleus into the other parts of the cell fusion rna moves to amino acids replication copying the sequence to replicate the dna reaches stop codon the stop codon stops the sequence from being replicated any further
11525,5,1,1 after the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to the ribsome where the trna is 2 when at the ribosome the mrna transfers the data to the amino acid sequence in the trna 3 after transfering the data goes through protein chains fulled by atp 4 after completing all the steps the protien is sent throught the body for energy

11693,5,1,when mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to rrna and then it changes to trna which carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acids
11694,5,0,mrna directs the rna to make the protiens then a signal from the nucleus tells it to stop
11695,5,0,when the mrna leaves the nucleus it divides the new dna into all of the different cells
11696,5,0,after it leaves the nucleus it then goes to the trna to give it some memory then after that it goes to the rrna to make more ribosomes
11697,5,0,the messenger rna conects to amino acids to give'directions' to them protiens are then conected to the mrna an connected to the amino acids creating more rna
11698,5,0,mrna leaving the nucleus
11699,5,1,1 the mrna is split in half 2 one half of the mrna runs through a ribosome 3 while the half of the mrna is being ran through the ribosome a protien is being made according to the instructions 4 the protien travels to wherever it is 'programmed' to go and to do whatever it is 'programmed' to do
11700,5,0,wellll i think the first one might be meiosis or mitosisbut i really don t have any idea so i m just taking a wild guess so i don t get this question wrong kthanks for the poinnts
11701,5,0,1 rna arrives from other cell2 rna copied translation 3 rna tranported through mrna4 rna leaves to go to other cell
11702,5,1,after the mrna leaves the nucleus it binds with the rrna after they bind together they begin transciption to make more copies for more protiens after transcription occurs translation begins to decode the rna that has been made after this has been done the rna then begins to made amino acid that will form protiens
11703,5,1,in protein synthesis the mrna must first leave the nucleus it then goes to the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome from there it attaches to its complimentary codon and finally becomes a protein strand
11704,5,0,the mrna leaves then nucleus it goes and copies a protien for the sequence it returns to the nucleus it transfers the protein
11705,5,0,it goes to the to the nuclues then gets coded on the dna and then turns into waste

11709,5,0,they all do there job
11710,5,0,1 proteins leaves the nuclei2 proteins become stable3 orgenelles become numerous4 the reproduction rate becomes high
11711,5,0,1 first mrna sends a message to the protein strand and tells it what amino acids it needs to build the strand 2 then the trna goes and gets the codons from the amino acids so they can build their protein 3 next they group the codons in three so they can be read so they know what amino acids to get 4 last they put the amino acids in order and then you get a protein strand
11712,5,0,its good for youmakes you stronggood for health
11713,5,0,mrna then codes for pretiens that bind with rrna

11720,5,2,in protein sythesis the mrna travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm there a ribosome reads the code on the mrna as the ribosome reads the code trna find free amino acids and bring them to the mrna to be arranged when they are arranged they form peptide bonds that help them to serve their function as a protein
11721,5,3,after mrna leaves the nucleus it enters into the cytoplasm where it docks at a ribosome made of rrna next trna reads the codons and using its anticodons goes out into the cytoplasm to pick up the amino acid that corresponds it then travels back to the mrna and connects its amino acid with the one previously set before it once the trna reaches the stop codon the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed
11722,5,1,the mrna leaves the nucleas and goes to trna which transfers the codons and anticodons then which gets translated into a sequence which produces amino acids and then in the sequence makes proteins
11723,5,3,the mrna finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on once the mrna finds the ribosome the aug codon starts the protein synthesis next trna bring the correct anti codons to the mrna for the construction of the protein once the trna have delivered the correct anti codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti codons the anti codons are then paired up the the codons on the mrna strand and peptide bonds form between each of the anticodons when the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made
11724,5,1,1 the rna goes into a ribosome2 transfer rna brings amino acids to mach the sequence of the mrna 3 as more trna comes with more amino acids the amino acids start to stack up4 the compleated protins breaks away

11730,5,0,the four strands the production of protein helping the mrna in able for it to complete the synthesis the proteins are assembled
11731,5,2,next trna change the rna strands from as ts cs and gs to as us cs and gs so that it can be read by something that i can't remember but then it's changed back to its original state and paired with anti codons that are attached to amino acids the anti codons break off so that only the amino acid remains once the anti codons reach the stop codon the amino acid chain breaks off and is now a protein
11732,5,0,one step involves the golgi apparatus in which it helps carry proteins another step uses the er which helps get rid of unwanted or wasted material involving the proteins lysosomes also help break down things that can help with protein synthesis
11733,5,3,first the mrna leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it second the ribosome reads every three nucleotide sequence or codon and calls for a trna molecule that has an anticodon to compliment the codon third after this process is repeated the amino acids on the trna molecules form peptide bonds with each other forming a protein finally after the mrna is translated until a stop codon the protein is released and used in the cell as needed
11734,5,0,1 first the nucleus would go through metaphase 2 second the nucleus would go through anaphase 3 third the nucleus would go through telophase 4 last the nucleus would go through cytokenisis
11735,5,1,after leaving the nucleus mrna goes to the ribosomes and turns into trna once it becomes trna it makes codons or becomes anticodons once it becomes codons it makes amino acids
11736,5,0,1 it turms into trna and travels to the ribosome 2 it picks up surrounding amino acids and takes them to the ribosome 3 it forms rrna and begins binding the amino acids in the ribosome 4 it then forms a new strand of rna
11737,5,0,collecting nutriants storing them anaphase and then there is prophase
11738,5,0,1 they have proteins2 they help wit mrna3 4
11739,5,1,first mrna leaves the nucleus with a strand of dna which contains the instructions to making an amino acid it takes the dna strand to the trna in the ribosomes there the trna uses the codons to make the sequence of amino acids the amino acids are then transferred by the trna to the rrna where they become a protein
11740,5,0,mrna leaves the nucleus carrying instructions for the amino acid sequence to create proteins first the mrna will send the instructions to the needed part of the cell then this will turn into dna thirdly proteins would begin to be ensembled in the correct part of the cell and lastly they would be released into the body where they are needed
11741,5,3,next mrna attaches to a ribosome where the code on it will be translated to the order of amino acids needed to make a protein rrna combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain trna finds amino acids that match with the code it carries and takes carries them to the ribosome where it matches its amino acids to the code on teh mrna all of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein
11742,5,0,1 the mrna takes the coded dna to trna2 the trna takes the coded dna and translates it to amino acids 3 the rrna copies the amino acids4 they are placed as traits
11743,5,1,the first step is where the mrna goes to the ribosones soo they dna can be replicated the second step is wjere the trna gets added with the dna the third step is when the trna foes back to the nucleus to get added to the dna i cant remember the last
11744,5,0,the mrna must copy its self
11745,5,0,mrna is when it carries information to trna which then carries instructions from the nuclues to the amino acid sequence for the protein rrna then takes the information to the center of all the protein synthesis

11761,5,0,the trna comes in and copies itselfthen the mrna sends protiens to all the trnathen the mrna comes back then it adds another mrna
11762,5,3,the first stepis mrna connects to the ribosome to keep it in place secondly trna brings the anticodons and they match with the bases pair on the third step another trna brings another anticodon and the amino acids at the end stick togather and the fourth step is that these steps are repeated and all the amino acids stick together and form a protein until they get to the stop codon
11763,5,0,the prophase lets the rna form the chromosomes metaphase lines them in the middle anaphase seperates them on opposite ends of the cell then telophase seperates them into new cells
11764,5,0,mrna gives the message to trna wich transfers the message to the grna wich sends it to th rrna wich then makes it into protiens

11860,5,0,metephase where the cell still has it's nuclues prophase the step where the nucleus dissapears and the organisms start to form a line for seperation telephase the last step before the cell divides the organisms inside the cell seperate to different ends of the cell to get ready for anaphase the line is fromed in the middle of the cell anaphase where the cell divides into two cells
11861,5,1,the mrna goes to the ribosomes for the instructions on making protein it then goes to the mitochondria to get energy they it goes back to the nucleus to produce the protein
11862,5,0,it brakes down into smaller parts and then is shipped to different parts of the body so it can be used as energy
11863,5,0,when the mrna leaves the nucleous the protiens go with it

11867,5,0,it leaves the nucleus and helps the cell find protiens for the cell and help it survive and make it healthy
11868,5,3,after mrna leaves the nuclues it goes to ribosomal rna each trna anticodon is attached to an amino acid found in the cytoplasm and comes to the rrna the trna forms the complement of the mrna strand and the attached amino acids connect to one another until a stop codon is reached
11869,5,0,1 mrna leaves the nucleus carry the message from the cell membrane 2 rrnacarries the ribosome to the codon3 trna transfers the segment needed to be traslated 4 the condon strand is translated

11871,5,0,prophase metaphase anaphase and telephase
11872,5,3,1 after mrna leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosome where rrna recognizes the mrna strand and a start codon and coordinates the ribosome to attache to the mrna 2 once the mrna is within the ribosome sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mrna strand otherwise known as a codon and a corresponding anticodon attached to trna and an amino acid are signalled to attach 3 trna continues to attach itself to the mrna strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons in doing so the trna which have attached amino acids begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein 4 once the the protein has been formed which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome from there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly
11873,5,0,amino acid makes the protienthe protien does stuff with the ribosome
11874,5,0,it goes to the michochindria and starts attaching codons to make aprotein

12262,5,1,first mrna leaves the nucleus after being transcribed from half a single strand of dna then the small and large ribosomes come attach to the rna to translate it the codons are then translated into a certain amino acid and the small and large ribosomes pull the needed amino acid over and then slide to the next codon this happens multiple times until there is a long chain of amino acids that make a protein
12263,5,0,translation which is when the dna spilts and forms a rna strand on the cytoplasm transcription which is when dna is copied and kept in the nucleus where the process takes place transformation which is when protiens make a double helix strand of dna there is also meiosis which is when two cells are split into four dipliod daughter cells
12264,5,0,four major steps are that interphase takes place this is where the cell completely splits then there is rrna which relays the message to let them know what is happening there is anaphase which is where the cell starts to divide then there is also telophase where the cell's nucleotides start to get sent over to the other side of the cell

14843,6,0,the cell wall blocks proteins will carry the transfer of chemical make up or dna
14844,6,0,they use the flagellum to move
14845,6,0,the cell membrane lets substances in an out of the cell the mitochondria ships things that are need out the golgi apperatus also removes unwanted things

14851,6,0,1 communitcation2 filters 3 protects
14852,6,0,1 there is active transport to where the cell is allowed into the cell or not the active transport allows only certain type of organisms to enter or leave the cell 2 diffusion is another way cells get in and out of the cells is where the cell depending on it's size will determine whether or not that it is able to move throughout the cell 3 the other one is where the nuclear envolope sends a messeges and tells the membrane what to do from there
14853,6,0,one proses is called cell movement that is where the cell is moved thrue the cell by the organells
14854,6,0,the rough er golgi membrane in the mitichondria

16994,7,0,the first trait that rose exemplifies is the trait of expressing someones feelings one example when rose trys to explain to anna about her dad getting a better job for them to go to college and actually getting something out of life another example is when rose expresses how she feels about cambodian her first country and how she wishes it would be just like that
16995,7,1,rose seems like a very compassionate young girl that truely wants to help her family throughout their time of need 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then stragiht home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper ' she helped out her family so much even though the stress was weighing down on her

17089,7,1,a trait that i see in rose is that she is very caring she is concerned for anna when she walks up in tears and she asks her whats wrong the whole time in there conversationg she tries to calm her down like when she tried to laugh to relax the tension between them
17090,7,0,rose is tired she has a lot on her plate for someone of her age from work to school to homework and helping her brother through college she is having trouble taking care of all of it and just wants someone to help her get some of the weight off of her back
17091,7,2,based on her conversation with anna rose can be seen as mature when rose is talking to anna she tells her that what her family is doing is necessary anna doesn't understand why their father has to be away in los angeles she also doesn't understand why money is so important to her parents this is where rose shows her maturity she explains to her sister the importance of their father's job and why they need the money so badly
17092,7,0,rose says that they have their part to do while paul is away at college this shows that rose is independent and smart
17093,7,0,in rose's conversation with aun kolab rose reveals her concern for other peoples' feelings her care of others' feelings show up previously in her conversation with anna anna walks in feeling down but instead of venting her own feelings rose keeps them to her self and listens to her sister
17094,7,0,'honest' because rose tells anna that helping paul would help them finish college then he'll get a good job and he'll pay for anna and rose to go to college
17095,7,1,a trait that can describe rose based on her conversations would be that she is very thoughtful one detail from the story that shows this is that even when she has much work to do she still listens to her aunt kolab and her sister when she is needed

17098,7,2,one trait that can describe rose is that she is caring for others one detail to support this answer is how rose decides not to tell aunt kolab the truth about feeling weighed down because of the possiblity of hurting her
17099,7,0,it says in the text that her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter like that the pressure had been lifted
17100,7,0,she is not very caring like for example on paragraph eight sentence two she said like she was careless 'mama's not home yet is she ' she was being sarcastic with her sister
17101,7,2,rose is a very helpful person and does stuff that will help other people she is working so her brother paul can go to college
17102,7,2,many of rose's traits are displayed throughout the story one trait that is shown is how she is caring in the text rose is worried about hurting her mother or her aunt rose feels as if she is being overwhelmed with everything she has to do this in turn causes her to have a dream of being trapped in the water by her older brother as she attempts to get out water fills her mouth and she sinks further down she decides to tell her aunt of this dream her aunt then begins to question her about if she feels weighted down rose ignores the question because she doesn't want to hurt her family
17103,7,0,i think that accepting life is one because she tries to explain to her sister the way that life is going at the moment for them
17104,7,0,rose at first only cared about the future of success in relation to money but actually she does not feel that she should complete the tasks to make it happen she doesn't want so much responsibility weighing down on her
17105,7,1,a trait that describes rose would be responsible an example of how rose is a responsible young lady is because during her conversation with her aunt she doesnt respond when her aunt asks her 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' she does not answer because she knows that she has to help out in order for her family to be able to survive
17106,7,2,considerate in paragraph 19 the author writes 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother '
17107,7,0,one trait that stands out to me mostly in rose is fear of what she must do for her brother and how so much responsibility is laid on such a young girl according to the passage rose thinks to herself 'paul's fate lies partly in these' referring to her hands that statement represents that she is thinking about what she has been doing for her brother to go to college and how her brother's getting into college shouldn't rely on her
17108,7,1,she is really trying to help the family
17109,7,0,one word that can describe rose is 'busy' she is always on the run after school she has to put in four hours at the restruant and than right as she gets out of school she has to go home watch her sister and do her home work on top of all of that she has to do a three thousnad word essay that is for a state competition if she won that competition she would not be able to go to sacramento her dad is also in los angeles andher brother paul is at college

17111,7,0,rose is from cambodialine 20 'in cambodia our first country what we are all doing would be quite normal '

17113,7,0,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with her aunt would be that she is frustrated with the situations in her family life one detail from the story that supports my answer is that roses aunt asked hert if it was difficult for her and she nodded
17114,7,0,the one trait that can describe rose is intelligent one example of this is that she is going to enter an essay contest
17115,7,0,rose is concerned and is filled with self conflict didn't know wether or not to tell her aunt
17116,7,2,one trait of rose's is reassurance she tries to reassure her sister that everything will be better when she says 'then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' this statement clearly proves the point of her being a good big sister and trying to make her sister feel better

17118,7,1,one trait that describes rose is that she's really caring torward her family paragraph 13 the way she describes her brother's high school graduation
17119,7,0,rose is a very positive person and is the oldest of her sister anna while the two of them were having a conversation rose is trying to explain to anna many different things since rose is the only one who is often around the house when anna talks about how she misses her father rose explains to her that he had to go to make a living and that he would be back soon
17120,7,0,rose is a good person and wants to do everything she can for the family when she talks to aunt kolab and when her aunt offers to sell some baked goods rose feels a burden lifted off her shoulders one exmple from the story is that when her aunt asks 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose doesn't answer because she didn't want to hurt her aunt and she just wanted to continue to help the family
17121,7,0,by the time rose tiptoed into their room anna was already snoring lightly rose slid into bed and watched the lights from passing cars move across the walls they became the light that had illuminated the stage att paul's high school graduation
17122,7,1,from this story i think the best trait to describe rose is that she's unselfish you can see why rose is unselfish when she talks about how even if she won the essay competition she couldn't go get her prize from sacramento because she wouldn't be able to take off of her work which helps support her family this part of the passage helps you see that rose puts her family before herself
17123,7,1,rose seems to be a strong person that can take care of her family even though she isn't the mother she is taking care of her and other's responsibilities when rose fake laughed to help comfort her sister it showed that she actually cares and she is a mother like figure to anna
17124,7,2,i think that one trait of rose that i picked up from her conversations is that she is very hard working she shook her head yes to her aunts question of the situation being difficult for her she knows it is difficult and she knows that the outcome of her work will be better for her and her sister but yet she still works reallyhard to get her brother to college that shows me that she is definitaly a hard worker because she is doing it so she can go on and work even harder to get to where she wants to be in life
17125,7,2,rose is compassionate rose asks how anna feels she would not ask this unless she cares about her the reason she cares about her is that anna is rose's sister

17129,7,0,that she has to much thigns to do and its all in her hands her mother works very long nights nad her dad work all over the world
17130,7,1,rose is respectful because she puts what her family needs done before what she needs done
17131,7,1,she is very caring the way she helps her family and trys to help her brother
17132,7,2,she is caring you can tell this because she's worried about her sister she asks her if she's alright and she is trying to explain to her in a nice way that their dad had to go but that it would be okay
17133,7,1,according to rose's and anna's conversation rose seemed eager for her family to get out of the situation they are in and the conversation she had with her aunt best describes rose as eager and willing to help her family out in anyway she can
17134,7,1,rose is very understanding even when she is having a rough time rose tells her sister that their dad had to go because it was a decision good for the family she tries to stay positive for her sister

17139,7,0,confused she doesn't seem to quite understand what her sister is telling her and lead to where she is misguided
17140,7,1,i think it is the ablilty to care for others because rose has to give herself to help paul
17141,7,0,after having the conversatino with her aunt kolab rose finally realized that her life could be getting easier
17142,7,2,rose is caring we know this because in paragraph 4 6 rose is very concerned about the well being of her younger sister she asks her what's wrong and if she is feeling okay
17143,7,0,one trait of rose would be that she does not hae enought time to do everything in the house she is even having her sister do her essay for her
17144,7,0,one trait that can describe rose is that she is a quiet person she does not express her feelings very much for example when her aunt asked her 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose did not answer and she felt as if she would have answered she would hurt her aunt and her aunt would probably tell her mother

17148,7,2,a trait that well describes rose is that she puts other peoples feelings above her own and she cares more of how others feel than herself an example is in paragraph 19 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt '

17159,7,0,rose is very honest about her situation she wants to be less pressured her aunt can see this from their conversation
17160,7,1,from her conversations with anna i conclude that rose is like a mother figure to anna sometimes she tries to stay positive so her little sister doesn't get discouraged in the story it states that anna says 'you sound just like mama ' this shows that rose has the traits of a mother figure in their relationship since rose is the older sister she has to look over her little sister when her mother is gone

17162,7,2,rose is caring based on her conversation with anna because of her walking in and asking if she is okay and poured two glasses of orange juice and talked
17163,7,1,rose is hard working and feels like she has to work hard for her family by the dream you can conclude that she feels weighed down by the hard work she has to put into supporting her family she however continues to work on her essay and comes up with a topic to write about
17164,7,0,rose internalizes all her pressure and misgivings she hides her true feelings when she talks to anna 'she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her ' even rose doesn't believe what she says she only puts on a brave face while talking to anna

17171,7,1,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna is that she is just like her mom one detail that supports my answer is in paragraph 12 anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table and said 'you sound just like mama '
17172,7,0,'only if you already have everything ' rose said rose seems exhausted as if shes mad that she had to grow up so soon she doesnt like the fact that she has to have so much responsibility her papa not being there is what makes it worse for her even thought she thought it was better off for him to be in los angeles
17173,7,0,rose seems like a very shy person in her conversation with aunt kolab the only time she actually speaks is to relay her dream then when aunt kolab gives her some advice she just nods several times and never vocalizes the fact that she was going to use the topic for her essay or that she was very helped out by aunt kolabs's advice
17174,7,0,she is very dreamy

17222,7,0,one thing that describes rose is that she is over worked and tired one detail is that most of her days had been too long too demanding from school she had gone stright to the restaurant to work a four hour shift than stright home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper

17228,7,0,rose tries to look at the bright side by telling anna that everything will be fine but she is actually very worried
17229,7,0,in rose's conversation with aunt kolab her aunt asks 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' she remains quiet i feel that this reaction sums up how she is feeling she is stressed yet she doesn't want to hurt her family she wants to help because she loves her family though she is struggling
17230,7,0,ignorant because she didn't give up on all here work to do she kept on goin and found a solution
17231,7,0,her life can get easier maybe it wouldnt so it might ot might not
17232,7,0,one trait that can be described is pride instead of rose swallowing her pride and telling anna what she really felt she coverd up her felling and told he sister something else in witch to get here sister to leave her alone or change the sbject
17233,7,1,one trait that can descibe rose is her loyalty to her family she will do anything to help her family succeed this is shown when it is revealed that rose works at the restaurant to help her brother pay for college

17238,7,0,the fate of rose lies in pauls hands her aunts trying to help her by making her feel lighter and made her think of a topic
17239,7,2,i believe that rose is careing in the conversation she had with her aunt kolab about the dream rose did not want to explain to her aunt the way she felt because she felt that she would hurt her aunt by telling her the way she felt i think that when someone puts someone elses feelings or thoughts before their own is a careing person
17240,7,0,anna is a very smart girl and the reason i think that is because she was gone do a three thousand word essay
17241,7,0,rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her
17242,7,0,rose misses her dad terribly but knows he's just doing this job in los angeles to help pay for her brother's education anna misses him too and she says she doesn't care about the money she just wants her father back

17247,7,0,in the story your perspective is from rose rose like other humans has many traits to her personality one trait that you can see is giving an example of this is how she works to help her brother get through college she seems to be constantly busy but doesn't outrightly complain about it this is an example of a trait i find rose has
17248,7,0,to me rose seems like a competitive girl she doesn't want to loose meaning by that the fact stating she has to write a three thousand word essay rose says 'even if i win i won't get to travel to sacremento to recieve the prize ' this means she wants to win she won't give up on her dreams
17249,7,0,i think rose is decribed as a hard worker an is exhausted in the passage it replies 'the day like most of her days had been too long too demanding from school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework ' this example supports my answer why i think rose is decribed as a hardworker an is exhausted

17255,7,2,one trait that rose has in the story is that she works hard for the success of others and does not think about the affects on her when rose is tired from working and helping her aunt she must then do her homework she does not have much time to do so and is often too tired to even finish this proves that she believes she can help make a difference for paul and that he will return the favor even though rose is extremely busy helping her family put her brother through college she surpresses her real feelings to her family because she must do her part in the story rose supports this claim by thinking 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt ' this is showing that she does not want to work and instead focus on school but she knows what she must do and is afraid of hurting her family in the story rose is a hard worker and respects other's feelings
17256,7,0,one trait that rose is dealing with is poverty rose feels she does not do enough to help rose's father moved else where to get more money for the family paul is going to college trying to make it through poverty is sad to say is what trait rose was stricten with

17279,7,0,in the story rose felt lonely she said maybe if her dad came home for a weekend or her mom took a day off to be with the girls and help them out with school work maybe she wouldnt feel that way
17280,7,1,rose has many traits t he one that stuck out to me the most is how hard wroking she is
17281,7,0,anna dont really tell how she realy feels in her conversation with aunt kalob she dont tell her how she really feels about helping the family
17282,7,2,'anna ' rose said 'what's wrong you feel okay ' one trait of rose is that she is caring
17283,7,1,one of rose's character traits is that she is hopeful for a brighter future regardless of the present problems in her life as can be seen in her conversation with anna she recogizes her current stresses will help them get into good colleges in the long run
17284,7,0,she gets worked up easy she thinks about the essay that she has to wright and that even if she wins she cant go get her prize then she thinks about her brother and everything that her parents did for him and about money and why her dad moved so far away
17285,7,0,one trait is exhausted she feels this way because she feels it is all up to her her conversation with aunt rose verifies this
17286,7,0,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with anna is that she is lonely in the passage she talks about how she misses her father and wishes that her mother was around more she shows that she really wants them in her life and is heartbroken that they are not

17289,7,0,rose is a very busy girl often tied down with taking care of her sister anna and wanting her mother home but she finds herself in a self centered position and would complain about how terrible her life is at the end of this story she realized that she can survive this family splitting all by herself when she said 'suddenly it occurred to her here was the topic for her essay although it was still vague cambodian tradition and sense of family she realized could survive an ocean crossing '
17290,7,0,rose seems very overwhelmed in paragraph thirteen rose is even troubled in her sleep about her overwhelming problems during the day this suggest that her life has become busy to the point of an overwhelming capacity
17291,7,0,in this story rose bears a lot of responsibility everyone in the family must work in order to pay for paul's education which will help the family as a whole rose feels too much pressure and she tries unsuccessfully to convince herself that she is alright with everything she is conflicted to say the least
17292,7,1,rose is a very caring person she gave up basically her whole life just to take care of her family one example of caring for her family that she portrays in the story is when she is writting her essay for the state competition and she gives it up because she knows that if she wins she wouldnt be able to go to sacramento anyways she would have to stay home and take care of her family
17293,7,0,she is stuburn and wants things her way because she just rolled her eyes and stormed out of the room
17294,7,0,in conversing with her sister rose continually reassures her of the brightness of the future attempting to laugh and sound optimistic she herself takes on the task of writing the essay an unnecessary burden on top of her numerous tasks suggesting that she is trying to repress a feeling of doubt that she shares with her sister thus a prominent characteristic of rose is her unwillingness to accept the desparation of her family's condition taking burdens upon her to help convince herself that things are going normally
17295,7,2,one trait that descibes rose based on the conversation between her and anna is that she is helpful in many ways to me it seems that rose is more of the mother figure in anna's life and is there for her when she needs something she helps tries to help out with the money situation by working an example of the book of how rose shows this trait is when anna woke up and came into where rose was rose asked if she was alright and if she felt okay
17296,7,0,in the story rose is hesatent to tell her feelings because she doesnt want to hurt anyone she says'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt' i think that rose is shy and that she wants to make things work for her family but she doesnt want to have to hurt anyone in trying to do so
17297,7,2,rose is a hard worker and worries a lot rose is very persistent one example is in paragraph two im paragraph it talks about how much homework she has to do then how she has to work to help support her entire family
17298,7,1,rose is helpful she works to help support paul and the rest of her family anna and aunt kolab both talk about the problems that are occuring because of all the things that they have to do to support the family
17299,7,0,rose seems a bit overloaded according to her conversation with aunt kolab
17300,7,2,one trait i found in this story about rose would be that she is caring her aunt kolab asked 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose is to caring about her aunt's feelings to tell her the truth and crush her feelings
17301,7,1,rose is a hardworker in the beginning of the story she explains going to school heading straight to work for a four hour shift and then straight home to help make dinner after all of that she still has to do homework
17302,7,2,she cares for her family when she talks to anna she said 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
17303,7,0,rose can be decribed as patient during her conversation with anna when she tries to to explain to anna why everyone is trying to work so hard to help paul finish college she calmly speaks to anna even though she knows anna may not fully understand even though anna clearly did not understand what rose was saying she does not lose her temper or show any negative reaction towards anna's retort at the end of the conversation instead she remains tolerant which takes a great deal of patience on her part
17304,7,2,rose is a person who puts others before herself and wants to be helpful 'rose didn't answer if she to d the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mom' this describes her puting her familly before herself
17305,7,0,rose tries to reassure her sister about their father working in a different place when anna says 'it feels like he's been gone for years ' rose kindly breaks in that he has only been gone for four months and that they needed the money
17306,7,1,i think a trait that rose has is caring rose is caring because she cares about her family and understands what things are going on and tries to help her sister understand she also is like a leader to her sister
17307,7,0,she seems somewhat self centered for example when her sister walks in the room she asks 'whats wrong you feel okay ' and when the sister replies that she had a bad dream she doesnt ask why or what happend
17308,7,1,she understands the importance of finacial need when she stated that her dad moved away to another job that paid three times what he was making before reveals that she has some intelligance in money
17309,7,0,rose's conversation with aunt kolab suggests that rose is very mature and responsible for her age rose's aunt can see how much stress she is under rose doesn't say anything though knowing the family needs money to survive when aunt kolab says something to rose about being 'weighed down by helping the family ' rose admits she's under much stress
17310,7,0,there mad that their mom has to work so late ''mamas not home yet is he' 'i hate how late she has to work'
17311,7,1,one trait that describes rose would have to be that she hard working she works for what her family needs so that there lives can become better
17312,7,2,she cares about her sister anna this is supported by rose asking anna 'whats wrong' and 'are you feeling ok'
17313,7,0,when rose's sister walked and asked what's worng rose tried to tell than she was fine that just she had another bad dream rose's sister said the money isn't everything then rose tell to her sister than they have to help paul so anna dislike for that 'you sond just like mama' anna wants to mean that rose start to think and talk like her mother
17314,7,0,one trait that can descibe rose is exhausted she is exhausted because of everything that she must do for herself and the family she must work at a restaurant after school and then go strait home to make supper and she still has homework to do rosa is a very buisy person and does not have enough time for herself or her homework
17315,7,2,one trait that can describe rose based on her converstation with aunt kolab is that she is caring that she cares what other people feel and how what she says may hurt the other person the statement that supports my answer would be 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mom ' that indicated that she cared what she could have said would hurt her aunt and that her aunt could very well tell her mom she was probably scared it would hurt her mother too
17316,7,0,rosa feels that she weiged down by her family and theres is not much she can do about it the floashback that involved her brother standing on top of her in the water sybolizes herfeeling weiged down and no able to get much help
17317,7,0,the conversations with anna or aunt kolab was a good sisters relationship
17318,7,0,one trait that describes rose based on her conversations with anna is pessimistic she doesn't believe that their life will get better as fast as anna would like it to you can see that by anna saying that money isn't everything and her enthusiasm as she talks about how paul will graduate college and help pay for their college fees rose acts accordingly and compares anna to her mother which shows that anna and her mother are the optimistic characters of the story
17319,7,0,1 she doesn't like to see people disappointed or u happy for example 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt '
17320,7,0,rose is a self absorbed american teenager she feels sorry for herself and believes she has a great burdon on her shoulders she does not realize that all of her family has had to work hard her aunt realize that she is like this because of where she was raised since rose feels she has to much burden aunt kolab says 'in cambodia our first country what we're all doing would be quite normal'
17321,7,0,i think that rose seems lonely and that is why she has so much in her life she works to help out the family but at the same time when she is home she does school work and helps out with supper i think that she feels the same way anna does but doesnt want to admit it with her doing all of these things she has no time to miss her mom dad or even paul
17322,7,1,she works hard for her family she went to school worked for four hours after then had to help her aunt with dinner after she had homework that must be completed she had no time to finish the essay
17323,7,1,she is wanting to make everything good for her and her family because her dad is gone so she is working very hard to keep up but it is alot of work and she is having trouble getting everything done in time like she came from school and went straight to the resturant to work for four hours then straight home to help her aunt make supper and then had to try to get a essay done and she didn't have a topic yet
17324,7,2,rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people ''anna ' rose said 'what's wrong you feel okay ''
17325,7,1,she is a very hard worker she works four hours at her job then comes home to help make supper and then writes her essay
17326,7,0,rose seems like a truthfull person because she tells anna about their dad being gone for only four months and that he is making better money
17327,7,1,rose did not want to hurt her aunt she doesn't like hurting people so she wasn't going to tell her aunt that she felt so weighed down by what she was doing for her family
17328,7,1,hardworking rose is a very hard working individual she has school work housework and homework she takes on more responsibilites than she can probably handle but she does it all for the good of the family you can see rose's hardworking efforts as she goes above and beyond to win a essay contest she puts more on her plate than she can eat but she takes every challenge head on you can tell she is working hard from the stress that is related to us through her character she is strong for her sister making everything seem just peachy but right when she has the chance she breaks down to her aunt let's her know how she really feels
17329,7,1,one trait that can describe rose is hardworking whether she wants to do something or not she still gets it done an example from the story is the fact that she goes to school works a four hour shift right after home to help her aunt prepare supper and then does homework
17330,7,0,rose was very busy on a normal day to day basis i know this because of how stressed she is that she does not have time to write her paper because of school work preparing supper and doing homework
17331,7,0,rose is heart felt girl who cannot let the past go due to some excructiating experiences as a young girl rose has re occurring dreams about things of her brother an example would be she has a vision of her brother recieving his diploma and she also has a dream of her brother jumping from a boulder and sinking down upon herself as if he was made of stone
17332,7,0,one trait that can describe rose based on her converstations with anna is that she knows how to push things to the side that she knows upsets her deep down and say what she thinks the true facts are one example from the story that shows this is when anna and rose are talking about her father being gone and to anna it seemed like it had been years that he had been gone rose jus responded with a simple answer of 'it's only been four months '
17333,7,0,that rose didnt answer if she told the truth or not
17334,7,2,rose said ' what's wrong you feel okay ' that is a trait of love
17335,7,2,rose is a rather optimistic person although she is very stressed out due to the work she must do daily she seems hopeful that all her efforts will pay off whether it be for paul her parents or herself
17336,7,0,rose feels very weighed down because she has too much on her plate and it drives her insane because she also has to do a bunch for her family too and she feels presured not to give up and to help as much as she can and i know this because of when she had that conversation with her aunt at the end she had her aunt explain what she was feeling in a different perspective
17337,7,2,rose is very selfless she shows this by not saying how she really felt when she was asked by her aunt instead of hurting her aunt and mother she kept it to herself
17338,7,2,rose is very caring about her family she sacrificed so much time to get a job and help pay along with her family to get her brother through college of course it doesn't mean that she is happy about it all the time but she still does care and wants to try somehow to help as much as she can
17339,7,0,she don't like to her peoples feelings because she don't tell her anut the truth about whats really makes her feel weigh down by what shes doing to help her family
17340,7,0,even if i win she thought i won't get to travel to sacarmento to recieve the prize
17341,7,0,to try to confort her the people that she see in dis stress in the story she tries to make a joke on how money isn't every thing to poeple that have everything
17342,7,2,she hides her feelings so she doesnt upset others like when she didn't want to tell the truth and hurt her aunt
17343,7,0,it is easily surmisable from the text that rose can be described as burdened it is enough proof to deduce her burdened and troubled mind set when the story describes her dreams as she feels that the weight of her brother is crashing down on her
17344,7,2,one trait that i saw in rose during her conversation with anna is that she is a positive person she is telling her sister the positive things that will come out of it also that even though she feels weighed down by everything she is still keeping her head up and staying positive for example rose said to anna 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
17345,7,0,rose is a nervous person she's saying 'even if i win i wount get to travel to sacramento to recieve the prize
17346,7,0,rose and anna both have a hard time writting an essay when they get mad they don't want to do it anymore and they walk off
17347,7,0,rose is paranoid she is paranoid with how her life is going with her mother working late and her father moving away to work somewhere else this is shown when she keeps having bad dream
17348,7,0,'i feel asleep working on my essay ' said rose rose was doing her essay and she feel asleep and had a bad dream and she woke up scared and anna ask if she was ok and rose said yaq i am ok
17349,7,0,one trait i identified was that she was more preoccupied with what was going on with her then however eveybody else felt a detail from the story is when rose ignored what her sister had to say and went on about her essay she was more concerned about the essay then rose's bad dream or how she was feeling
17350,7,1,the one trate i would identify rose with would be understanding she shows this trait when she explains to anna why papa had to leave
17351,7,0,i think she is desolate and worn out she works all the time to help her family and has no time for herself
17352,7,0,rose feels overworked and wants an easier life this based on when aunt kolab asked her if it's difficult for her to imagine life in cambodia
17353,7,1,rose is very responsible she spends her days at school then going to work then preparing supper and then doing homework she is dutiful because she is trying to prepare for her future at college and helping paul pay for his
17354,7,2,one trait that can describes rose based on a conversation with aunt kolab is that you can really feel what rose is actually feeling you can almost make a connection with rose and how she has to deal with life for example in the passage it says if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt so you get a feeling of how rose feels on the inside too you feel that she really cares for her family and doesn't want to upset anyone
17355,7,1,rose has a great trait the trait she has is will power rose does a lot for the family and she doesn't really ask for anything in return 'rose didn't answer one of aunt kolab's questions because she didn't want to hurt her feelings '
17356,7,1,rose is an caring person who cares about others and how they feel and she is not self centered she is an trustworthy person and is very reliable and she tends to be shy sometimes but she overcomes it a little bit
17357,7,0,rose is under a lot of pressure paragraph 3 says she has to write a flawless three thousand word essay
17358,7,0,she had a lot of flash backs and it was coming all back to her sister because it was about her brother
17359,7,0,rose is a very afraid to let any one down this trait is both good and bad for her personality it is a good thing because she is always there when someone needs something she would do anything to help someone around her it is bad because as rose's dream shows us rose can be taking on to much and doesn't know how to let it all go and tell people she can't handle it
17360,7,0,rose is very well at thinking before she speaks in paragraph 19 she thaught about what to say because she did not want to hurt her aunt
17361,7,2,rose is a caring person she wants her family to be well of and live a good life she did not want to hurt her aunt by telling her that she felt weighed down by all she does rose was trying to calm her sister when she was sulking about missing their father i see rose as a caring girl
17362,7,0,one trait that can discribe rose is she woulod like everything to be her way and if it does not go her way she does not wont to do it 'ann is mom home yet ' 'rose know i wish she would come home earlyer and not late all the time dad never did that and that would help me a lot if she came home earlyer '
17363,7,0,rose is the type of person that is afraid to tell the truth if she thinks that it is going to hurt someone elses feelings the reason i say this is because in paragraph nineteen it says rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probabaly her aunt would tell her mother
17364,7,0,when rose is talking to anna after anna pours two glasses of orange juice rose says that she is lonesome for papa he has been gone for four months which seems like he had been gone for years
17365,7,1,she works really hard and its for her family she would do anything for her family and they would do the same for her she is over working herself though she needs to get her essay done and work at the restaurant and help cook at her house but she does it anyway for her brother
17366,7,2,in her conversation with aunt kolab we can see that rose is tactful because she does not tell her aunt the truth for fear that she would hurt aunt kolab's feelings or that the aunt would tell rose's mother and it would hurt her mother's feelings
17367,7,0,rose is not a person who will easily express her feelings in her conversation with anna she sounded like she was perfectly content and not stressed by the fact that she has to help paul get through college it takes a strange dream and some probing by aunt kolab to get her to reveal her true feelings about the situation
17368,7,0,i think that rose is strong in the story it says that she was talking to her sister in the kitchen and that she was trying to help her sister understand their situation and help her come to better terms with it even though she felt the same way
17369,7,0,i think that at the end of the story she finally understandsthe strength of her culture and how her aunt was using it to make her feel better and lighter
17370,7,0,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is that she is worried she is worried that her older brother is going to weigh her down the dream in which paul sinks like a rock on top her supports my answer
17371,7,0,they are both kinda upset that their dad had to go to los angelous for his work they both knew that he was making more money that ever
17372,7,0,one trait that i can see in rose is that she doesn't want to her her aunt by telling her the truth also by listening to her aunt kolab she is starting to think her life might get easier i think the reason is her aunt kolab seems to help people see the good in life
17373,7,0,one trait that can describe rose's trait would be while shes listening to aunt kolab she doesn't directly answer her aunt cause she's afraid of hurting her aunt or her aunt telling her mother for instance aunt kolab says 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose only nodded
17374,7,0,she is a busy body cause she always has stuff to do
17375,7,0,busy'when would she have time to squeeze writing into her schedule
17376,7,0,she is always busy
17377,7,1,rose showed that she is very understanding when she had her conversation with aunt kolab as her aunt helps her think of other things and helps her keep her hope up by pointing out the bright side of things rose nods away at what aunt kolab says although she still questions it in her head she understands that maybe there is still something for her in her future
17378,7,1,that she is worried about her family
17379,7,1,rose seems to be very kind she didn't want her aunt to feel bad and also stuck up for her dad in her conversation with anna
17380,7,0,rose is a very busy girl she has to deal with being in high school having a job helping her aunt kolab with house work and she has to write a three thousand word essay
17381,7,2,one trait that can descibe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring i think rose is caring because her young sister is sad because she misses her dad rose tries to comfort her and tries to tell her that their dad had to go away to make more money
17382,7,0,she grew up here and here mom and everybody else grew up in cambodia she has a dream that her brother is a heavy weight sinking her down to the bottom of a body of water and that gives her the oppurnity to see the situation through someone elses eyes
17383,7,2,based on her conversation with anna rose can be described as caring because she puts her sister's needs before her own although she needs to write a three thousand word essay she is more concerned that her sister had a bad dream and is missing their father
17384,7,2,rose is very thankful even if what her aunt offered did not work it still make a difference in how she felt what her aunt did was take some stress away and give rose a little hope
17385,7,2,one trait that rose has is that she understands some things have to be sacrificed for the better of the family this appears when she is talking with anna in the kitchen after they both wake up anna says 'i'm so lonesome for papa it seems like he's been gone for years ' para 8 rose's response is 'he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here ' para 9 this shows that for her age and the amount of responsibility she has she still understands that the sacrifice for a family is the most important thing of all
17386,7,2,rose can be described by hopeful she is hoping or wanting more to come out of the future when rose and anna are talking at the beginning of the story rose talks about how once paul finishes college he will get a good job and help support the rest of the family and help pay for both of them to go to college
17387,7,0,rose was nice to her sister at first but then kinda got angry in the story they were talking about their dad and rose made anna mad
17388,7,0,i feel like rose is very stressed in the second paragraph the first sentence rose talks about how most of her days were long and too demanding then it describes in the third paragraph how she doesn't feel like she will have time to squeeze in her essay
17389,7,1,personally i believe that rose is sincere she is trying to help her family to the best of her ability but she is heavily weighed down by circumstances in this story rose goes through her to do list for a typical evening you would think that the list would be much shorter for someone her age but then you realize what she has to sacrifice to keep her family going i wish we could all have her sincerety
17390,7,1,the one trait that rose has is to work hard fo rher family to get by without some of her family memebers i get this support because her sister and her have a talk about mone yand that her dad is gone and her mother works a long shift just to get money for them to survive
17391,7,1,one trait that describes rose is a hard worker she goes to school every day then goes to wrork and eventually she comes home and only has time to do homework she still get everything done and that is why rose is a hard worker
17392,7,0,she isnt very happy
17393,7,2,i would say rose is an understanding person in the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family she is understanding of why her father has to live in l a and why her mother has to work so late she is trying to win a prize for an essay but realizes she might not be able to travel to get she is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding
17394,7,1,rose seems to understand that everything she is in the best interest of her and her family but the pressure only weighs down on her more this is prevalent when she is speaking with her sister anna despite the feelings of stress bearing down on her she explains their current situation to her sister calmly and sincerely
17395,7,2,she seems hopeful even though she has it rough when she was telling her sister about how paul was gonna help them after he graduated college and got a good job anna was the one acting grouchy and like she didn't really believe it was going to work out
17396,7,0,she seems iritated and tired because in the story she wakes up and says oh no and groaned this shows that she is very unpleased and that she is very tired and irritable
17397,7,2,she cares about others she didn't answer her aunt because she didn't want to hurt her
17398,7,1,she is determined to help the family but feels to young to take on the challenge of growing up so fast
17399,7,0,she is tiered of all the pressure that she is on like takeing care of her family and writing 1000 word essay than the pressure for paul
17400,7,0,rose tells anna and aunt kolab that she is in some way being weighed down rose had a dream that paul was holding her down
17401,7,0,rose is the kind of person that is very straight forward bout things in the passage she tells her sister things that she may not wanna hear
17402,7,1,i believe that in the story rose is a very brave responsibal girl during the story she is charged with taking care of her familuy while also living in a new country
17403,7,1,in the story the conversation with rose and aunt kolab would describe rose as a helping person she dosen't mind helping out in the family but meanwhile at the end of the day she feels exhausted and wish she could tell her aunt but not in a way that will hurt her or her mother
17404,7,0,rose is dismissive and a little passive she answers her aunt truthfully but only with non verbal communication this shows shes dissmissve for the subject
17405,7,0,rose appears to feel overwhelmed by everything that is thrown at her a rough job taxing schoolwork and a homelife that takes up most of the time she has that would normally be free to anyone else ' from school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework '
17406,7,1,well she is caring and nice
17407,7,2,rose is exhausted but she is too nice to let anyone know when she talks to aunt kolab she is caring because she didnt tell the truth because she didnt want to hurt her aunt or her mother
17408,7,2,concernedi think she is concerned for her family and how her brother is the one that has to be the one that suports her and her little sister anna she says she is concerned about her mother having to work so late
17409,7,0,rose seems to be worried about money in her coversation with anna a detail that supprts this when she brings up the fact that her dad is making more money now away from them than he did with them
17410,7,2,in the passage 'crossing over' rose has many different traits but the trait that is most evident to me is her mother like responsibility when anna wakes up from a bad dream rose checks on her and asks her 'what's wrong ' this suggest that she is wanting to take care of anna then when rose is talking to her aunt kolab her lets the reader know that rose has a big resposibility with the family when her aunt says 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' this implies to the reader that she has a lot of resposibility to take care of the family the two examples that are given are small but imply much more that rose is almost like a second mother for her family
17411,7,0,rose is
17412,7,0,one trait that can describe rose is that she never get angry at the people she loves rose and anna have to help paul finish college and when paul is out of college he'll pay for rose and anna
17413,7,2,one trait that rose shows is compasion she cares about everything that her family has had to work for to get to the united states rose knows that she needs to work hard just like her brother did to gradutate she does so many things to be accomplished that she doesn't care how stressed out she is all she wants is a good life for her and her family
17414,7,0,rose feels wieghed down by everything and trying to help out the family all the time when her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down she does not answer
17415,7,1,rose is responsible when it says 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurent to work a four hour shitft' this shows he responsibilty and what position she holds in her family
17416,7,0,rose feels like she is being weighed down and can't help her family when rose is asked by momma if she is weighed down and she looks at her and just walks away ignoring her
17417,7,2,in the tory when rose said to anna when paul graduates he will get a good job and help afford to send them to college this shows a trait of being optimistic also whe talking to her aunt although she said things probably won't get much better she stayed on the plus said and said maybe they will
17418,7,1,one trait that can describe rose is that she cares about what is right for the family instead of what she wants because when anna said she doesn't care about money and she wants papa home thats being self centered rose shows the positive side of her father being gone and just accepts it and is willing to keep helping the family
17419,7,0,rose is unhappy and supresses her feelings of how she really feels to make others feel better she doesn't want others to see her as someone who can only take so much an example of this is when rose's sister walks into the room she acts as if falling asleep while working on an essay that is important to her is okay she tells anna that they need to do this for thier brother and that in the end he can help them get to where they want to be she also jokes about money with anna as if things were alright with money at this time
17420,7,2,the one trait i think that describes rose is that she is caring i say this because when she was talking to her aunt she wanted to tell her the dream she had she ended up not telling her aunt beacause she thought it would hurt her
17421,7,0,rose seems like a very open person she uses personification when the narrator said 'rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her ' this just tells you that her and her aunt would talk about it openly
17422,7,2,rose is caring her conversation with anna shows this rose asks anna if she feels okay
17423,7,2,during her conversation with aunt kolab rose doesn't tell her how she feels this shows great responsibility because she knows that it is part of her job to help her brother she also says that to anna that he is the one that can help them get to college she is willing to sacrifice her time to help her brother achieve his goal of graduating from college
17424,7,0,one trait that can describe rose is respectful because when aunt kolab asked her 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family' rose doesn't say anything because she did not want to hurt her aunt's feelings or her mothers
17425,7,2,she is very sincere and thinks about other people's and cares about other people's feelings rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
17426,7,1,rose feels weighed down because of how much she's trying to help her family she feels like she has to carry most of the problems in the conversation rose has with her aunt kolab towards the end of the story her aunt specifically asks her if she feels weighed down by what she's doing to help her family and rose doesn't answer it gives proof that she does not want to tell her aunt or her mother
17427,7,0,they are in the same family and like roses
17428,7,0,rose had a talk with her aunt and it made her ffeel alot better then she actually felt
17429,7,0,anna is very hardworking she says that she works a shift at a job somewhere she also has to keep a veil of confidence up for her younger sibling in order to keep her from being frightened
17430,7,0,rose is frustrated i think shes frusterated because she has a very big essay to do and no parents to help her and she has to take care of her little sister
17431,7,1,rose is a girl who is always putting her family first though she fights with her sister and has terrible dreams about the weight put on her shoulders that she explains to her aunt she still always tries to put her family first she takes the dreams shes been having and relates them to everyday life in cambodia and later finds a topic for a state championship essay that would help her family out greatfully
17432,7,0,rose talks to her sister anna and they start getting in a argument about there family and money rose doesn't like that her mom works so late and her dad had to move so he could get a better job for his family anna said it helps them a lot because of the money they make but all rose wants to do is see her dad and mom more
17433,7,0,she is very brave it takes alot of courage to write a long essay like that and have to present it at a state competition she is also brave for talking to her aunt about what is going on
17434,7,1,rose tries to put things lightly so that she wont hurt others feelings this becomes apparent when she is talking to anna about their father and trying to comfort anna
17435,7,0,rose works too much she works after school and has to do her homework and come back and take care or her bothers and sisters
17436,7,0,i could tell that she was up set with the way that things were happening to her her aunt sees that and offers to make some stuff to sell that comes from her country
17437,7,0,one trait to describe rose would be guilt because of the dream she has about paul jumping off the boulder and landing on her in the water
17438,7,0,in rose's conversation with anns she seems very passive and not engaged in the situation when she explains to ana that 'he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here' it is apparent that she is telling her this just to make her stop worrying rose does not really intend to comfort her sister in their conversation
17439,7,0,she understands how important school is
17440,7,1,based on her conversation with anna rose is an understanding person anna is still young so she can not fully understand why her family is working so hard rose explains to her its for the enitire family for her brother and themselves rose overworks herself with school and work but she knows its for her family so keeps on perservering ignoring the fact that she feels too much responsibility for her age
17441,7,1,rose judging by her unwillingness to speak about how she felt to her aunt kolab works as hard as she does because she does not wish to let her family down
17442,7,0,when rose is talking to her aunt kolab her aunt tells rose that now she can tell that rose is seeing the problems and situations through other eyes i think what she is saying is that now rose is seeing life in a new perspective that now she doesn't just think that their family is having a hard time financially that now she knows by trying to be a part of the problems and help to resolve them
17443,7,2,one trait to describe rose would be optimistic in paragraph 11 rose is talking to anna about money and rose makes the comment that their part is help paul finish college so he can get a good job and then help them go to college their family is having problems and their dad just moved away to have a better paying job and rose is looking on the bright side and how the outcome will be good if they just don't give up
17444,7,0,rose was a procrastinator in the story she put off writing her essay until last minute then she couldn't think of anything to write
17445,7,0,she thinks its all about money anna glared at rose 'money isn't everything ' 'only if you already have verything ' rose said
17446,7,0,one trait that can describe rose is hardworking the story shows this when it talks about how most of her days are long when she has to go to school then the restaurant then home to help with dinner and finally to do homework this relates to her conversation with aunt kolab when her aunt can see how hard she is working and how exhausted she is when rose comes down in the morning her aunt then askes her is she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help the family
17447,7,1,rose is very willing to persevere and accompolish her goals one could seen this in the end when she is talking to aunt kolab 'rose kept nodding mayber her life would get easier '
17448,7,0,rose doesnt like to say her true feelingsparagraph 21 line 1 and paragraph 23 line 1 it says she just keeps on nodding
17449,7,1,rose to me seems like a very understanding person she listens to her sister when she is resentfull about there father and mother and tries to explain it so that she can better understand the situation herself rose also shows that she is understanding when her aunt comes to her with more ideas on ways to help out there older brother paul
17450,7,2,rose's sense of responsibity is evident in her conversation with anna her ability to suppress her own feelings to try and make things easier for her sister is a great personal trait
17451,7,1,rose is a very determined person you can tell this from the story because she is working hard in the resturant making dinner for her family at home and writing an essay to try to get a college scholarship all at the same time by reading conversations she had with her aunt kolab you can tell she is a very determined and hardworking person aunt kolab says 'do you feel weighed down by what your doing to help this family ' also shows that rose is a very determined person
17452,7,1,she is hopeful that her future will be worth the work she puts in she just needs to make out of this rough patch in life
17453,7,2,rose is caring and trys to comfort her sister anna when anna is down because her parents are never home rose says to anna in the story that 'he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here ' rose was trying to tell her sister it was important for their father to go away
17454,7,2,rose to me seems to be a very hard working person in the story she tells us she has work most days right after school then help with dinner and finally do homework by this point in the story you can already tell she is a busy just trying to please everyone she doesn't like that she is also so busy but because she is a hard working person she is making sure she never disapoints her family she knows they have given so much and continue to work hard so her and her younger sister have an education
17455,7,0,'i'm so lonesome for papa it seems like he's been gone for years ' 'it's only been four months ' this tells me that rose is a family girl she is not happy unless her family is with her and supporting her she is not happy about her dad having to leave for a job in los angeles
17456,7,1,she is strong inside because even under pressure she tries to help her family
17457,7,2,rose is a harworking young woman who would do most anything to protect her family rose puts aside her life in order to help her brother through school she works instead of plays so that her brother can get through school and take care of her rather than the other way around
17458,7,1,one trait that that can decscribe rose based on her conversation with anna would be worried my example from the context would be 'anna ' rose said 'what's wrong you feel okay '
17459,7,1,she is very hardworking and she cares about her family in the story it says that after school she went straight to work and straigh home to help prepare supper
17460,7,0,she in a way feels like she cares about the essay but if she does win than she cant pick up the prize anyway so she feels that there isnt realy a point in trying to win and her schedual is already realy busy as it is
17461,7,0,anna is from cambodia but grew up in the united states and she is seeing stuff diffrent then her aunt who grew up in canbodia
17462,7,1,rose is a very responsible girl she has more of a load on her than most girls her age would she worries about money her brother and her father her aunt kolab says that what they are doing is normal in cambodia this makes rose feel better and relieves her of some of the stresses that she feels in everyday life
17463,7,2,i think that rose is a caring person and that is why she always tries to make everyone else feel better rose wouldn't tell aunt kolab she felt a big weight on her doing everything she had to do because she didn't want to hurt her feelings
17464,7,2,caring when she is talking to anna she does as much as she can to be nice and comfort her about what is happening
17465,7,0,rose thinks that there is something wrong with anna
17466,7,1,rose is a hard working lady that wants to do good things for herself she is wanting to write this three thousand word essay but cant fit it into her schedule she wants to become a winner
17467,7,0,i think she's affraid to tell people what's wrong with her if there is something bothering her she would rather keep it to herself and deal with it other tham telling somebody about it that will help her
17468,7,0,one trait of rose seen in her conversation with anna is a selfish trait anna is attempting to confide in rose but rose just pulls the conversations topic back to herself
17469,7,1,one trait that can be used to descripe rose is positive rose is always looking towards the bright side of each situation no matter how bad the conditions also she keeps a strong attitude when her little sister talks to her about her feelings and problems
17470,7,1,she is responsible she has to do all these things such as school work then home to make dinner shes overworked
17471,7,1,one trait that describes rose is hard working i chose this word because she not only goes to school but she also works
17472,7,0,rose is slightly bitter a supporting fact is when she was talking to anna after she had a bad dream she tried to laugh but it sounded fake even to her
17473,7,2,rose is a thoughtful person she doesn't answer her aunt kolab so that she doesn't hurt her
17474,7,1,rose is a carring person when her sister came into her room she took her down stairs and gave a glass of orange juice to calm her down
17475,7,1,rose is a the type of girl that wants to do anything possible to please everyone she knows she wants to be known as dependable the one detail that comes to my mind is when rose is thinking about writing that essay eventhough she is very busy with working but she wants to win the prize
17476,7,0,rose tries to hide how she really feels when she talks to anna she tries to sound reassuring even though she is worried for example she tries 'a laugh that sounded fake even to her '
17477,7,1,rose is very dedicated to her family an example of this is when anna says 'you sound just like mama '
17478,7,0,she acts like her mom and says the same things her sister told her she sounded just like their mom
17479,7,0,anna is very courageous she doesn't mind working hard for the family even though it might hurt her an example of this is how she works a four hour shift after school to bring in money to help pay for her brother's schooling
17480,7,0,a trait that rose can be described by is realistic she realizes the importance of her dad taking a job in los angeles because it pays three times more than what he was making she knows that the money will go to good use by putting his children through college
17481,7,1,hard working rose understands that she and her family must work hard to get what they need in life she works hard to help pay for her brother's college knowing that once he has finished school and gets a good job he will help pay for her college in paragraph 11 she states this
17482,7,1,rose is very considerate although she probably resents that her father must get a job in los angeles she understands the greater goal behind his reasoning and tries to explain it to anna she knows that all of her family members need to help each other succeed
17483,7,2,rose care about what everyone thinks she listened to anna and helped her get over her bad dream she also cared about what aunt kolab had to say because she was trying to make live better for rose
17484,7,1,persistent
17485,7,0,in the story rose feels depressed as if she has no way out this gives her the trait that she is confused about her family
17486,7,0,she acts scared from her dream when she saw paul sinking in the water on top of her and she couldnt get out from under him
17487,7,0,shes needs to be more open with her aunt instead of being scared
17488,7,0,rose is a realist this is because after anna says 'money isn't everything ' rose says 'only if you have everything '
17489,7,0,fatigued at the beginning of the story she has a hard time staying awake because her daily schedule is so demanding
17490,7,0,fiesty ' you sound just like mama' she stood and stalked out
17491,7,0,that she puts stuff off till the last minute my proof of this is 'i fell asleep working on my essay '
17492,7,0,she does not want to write her three thousand word paper she has two conversations with people but yet she doesn't work on her paper
17493,7,0,her aunt talk about how life going to change
17494,7,1,rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
17495,7,2,rose is obviously an optomistic person during her conversation with anna in the kitchen she talks about how she thinks her brother will find a good job after college and then pay for their college this is a positive view that an optomistic person would have
17496,7,1,rose is haveing to act more like an adult to help support the family and the wishes thay have for their younger brother she showes that when she talks about being so busy with school work house chores and then homework
17497,7,0,she is very smart and knows what she is talking about because in the story she talks as if she is a grown up and she actually knows what she is saying
17498,7,0,although they have different views on life rosa is able to relate with everyone by understanding the way they think
17499,7,1,one trait that describes rose based on her converstions with aunt kolab is that she is very respectful of her family in paragraph eighteen she want's to tell aunt kolab how she feels but doesn't
17500,7,0,rose is wanting someone to take care of her example is that when her brother gets out of college she said he will take care of us
17501,7,0,rose asked her younger sister if she was ok and asked why she was up so early her sister said because i had a bad dream
17502,7,0,rose doesn't want to let her family down but she feels obligated to keep quiet and not tell anyone how she feels it's weighting her down and stressing her out in the story aunt kolab can sense that rose feels like she's being weighed down just by her emotions
17503,7,1,rose is very mature she has numerous responsiblities but she is mature enough to see how imperative it is that she complete them she does not try to push all of her responsibilities onto someone else
17504,7,0,one trait that can describes rose in her talk with aunt kolab would be attentive rose was attentive when she kept listening and nodding to what her aunt kolab was telling her
17505,7,0,in paragraph 11 rose states to anna that they both have a part in helping their brother paul through college and in return he will put them through college this shows that rose is generous she knows that by doing all she can to help her brother he will return the favor to not only her but her sister anna also
17506,7,2,rose is a positive person she thinks the best of each situation and hopes and dreams that things will get better in the story rose told anna that paul would pay for her and anna's schooling once he got a good job and earned a lot of money
17507,7,0,she wants to be selfish but know she can't so she does small selfish acts like ignoring anna ''anna ' rose said 'what's wrong you feel okay ''i'm fine ' her sister said 'i just had another bad dream ''i fell asleep working on my essay ' rose said '
17508,7,0,rose is kinda like the mother figure in this story she has alot of responsibilies to take care of in paragraph 14 line 2 she says she felt too young for so much responsibilty
17509,7,0,rose has a trait that makes her look like she is not confident in herself in paragraph 11 when she was talking to anna rose said that 'she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her' this tells you that rose is not confident in what she says because if she was she would have laughed like she meant it to cheer up her sister this also means that she is not confident in what she does because she thinks that she can not get her essay done in time and turned in at the end of the story in paragraph 23 however rose does get some confidence in her and thinks of an idea for her essay
17510,7,1,she is a hard worker she goes to work right after school for a four hour shift then goes home helps with supper and then finishes up with her homework
17511,7,0,'it's only been four months ' rose said as gentily as she could 'he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here '
17512,7,1,rose seems very responsible she is taking care of her sister alot and looking out for her brother like in paragraph fourteen 'she felt too young fo so much responsibility '

17514,7,0,rose is mean towards her little sister anna is being a good sister and a good friend to check up on her older sister and make sure that she s alright thats what family suppose to do
17515,7,2,i think that rose is loving when she was talking to anna all she tried to do was cheer her up that is the sign of a girl that really cares about her family and wants the best for them
17516,7,1,based on the convestations rose had with anna i would describe rose as supportive rose is trying to convince anna that what their family is doing is really what is best for all of them she has to support paul and her parents in the choices they are making
17517,7,1,rose is a very optimistical person she looks to the bright side of things when talking to her aunt
17518,7,2,rose is caring even thought she didnt sleep much and works hard during the day and into the night she still has time to ask anna if something is wrong
17519,7,0,that though she is worried about something she is understanding about what is going on in her life and that is waht allows her to deal with the problems in front of her
17520,7,0,i think that rose feels very overwhelmed because she has a job on top of school on top of a three thousand word essay on top of helping her brother get to school on top of being a good role model for her sister there are lots of things that rose has to be doing
17521,7,0,she thought maybe her life would get easier

17524,7,0,busy but wants her aunt to be happy like at the end of the story she starts suggesting other things for her aunt to do to make money because she feels like she's un happy
17525,7,2,rose was a caring niece and daughter because she did not want to hurt her aunt nor her mother by admitting that she felt weighed down by what she was doing for her family rose did not reply to her aunt's question if she was feeling weighed down for this reason
17526,7,0,shes kind of snoby

17532,7,0,that she don't like to talk to people about how she feels 'anna 'rose said 'what's worng you feel okay ''i'm fine ' her sister said ' i just had another bad dream'
17533,7,1,i see rose as being a stubborn little girl that was very close to her dad but when he had to go away for his new and better paying job they grew apart which made her really lonely
17534,7,0,rosa has many traits one trait she has is greed in her conversation with anna she does not seem to care that her dad is gone all she seems to care about is the money

17541,7,0,she is afraid to speak her mind
17542,7,1,i believe that rose is doing a lot for the family and is stressed out about everything she is doing as aunt kolab said 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' in return tells me that rose is stressed out not only about the family but about school also with the three thousand word essay she has to write and also her family she helps take care of
17543,7,2,she is hardworking i can see that from the conversation she has with her little sister anna in that conversation she talks about how it was their duty to pay off paul's college loans she isn't indifferent or mad she only has one thing in mind and that is that she and her family will pay off the loans and things will be better
17544,7,2,rose doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings during the conversation between rose and aunt kolab rose is asked if she feels 'weighed down' by everything she has to do to help her family rose does not answer this question because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings

17551,7,0,from reading this passage and rose's conversation with aunt kolab i believe that rose is very self contained she seems to keep her thoughts and feelings to herself so she doesn't hurt the thoughts and feelings of another person
17552,7,2,optomistic then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college

17564,7,1,one trait that describes rose is that she is a hard worker one detail from the story is that rose is constantly busy
17565,7,0,rose is a deligent person 'the day like most of her days had been too long too demanding ' even though her days had been too long she still made it through each one doing what she was suppose to do to help her family and herself

17569,7,0,rose seems to have many traits in this story but the one that sticks out the most to me is being independent rose has a lot of different obstacles but she seems to be alone even though she is not forced she feels it has to be done and without her everything will fail anna seems to help her refocus and give her some positive feedback but rose just seems to get even more upset and become once again independent about her issues an example from the story would be 'anna ' rose said ' what's wrong you feel okay 'i'm fine ' her sister said
17570,7,0,rose is surrounded by lots of things and is having to grow up fast she does not have that much time on her hands ever rose has to struggle with the fact that anna is upset about there father and that there is alot of things having to be done which she can not do everything
17571,7,1,when rose speaks with anna you can tell that she wants to be hopeful she says that paul getting a job will allow money for her and anna to go to college but the fake laugh shows that she is sceptical just like anna
17572,7,0,one trait from the story that describes rose is her understanding like where she was okay with her dad beeing gone because he was helping the family

17574,7,0,'i fell asleep working on my essay' rose means that she is a very very busy girl and don't have time for other stuff
17575,7,2,one trait that would describe rose based on her conversation with anna is that she is good with giving her sister hope by saying to her 'then he'll paul get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' rose is giving anna the hope of going to college and having a successful life
17576,7,1,rose works hard to help her family rose is easily pressured from all the work she has to complete rose does not want to work as hard to experience more childhood dreams she is very concealing of her true feelings and tries to agree with others in her family not wanting to disappoint them this feeling is evident when she speaks with anna trying to laugh at her own joke rose's fake laughter amplifies her true feelings
17577,7,2,anna could be desribed as understanding when anna walks in the room she immediately asks her what the matter is 'what's wrong you feel okay '
17578,7,0,'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college 'this shows that she is an incourager and also how she is an adult to
17579,7,0,rose is very exhausted and worried for the family rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her 'do you feel so wighed down by what you're doing to help this family

17592,7,1,she is supportive 'hmm maybe we can find a way to do things differently a way better for you ' her aunt's face lit up 'maybe i can sew for ladies or i could make special treats from our country and sell them '
17593,7,0,when she kept nodding her head thinking that her life would get easier that tell us that she care about her family cause she work just to get her brother throw college and she always talking to her family
17594,7,0,i think that rose is an over thinker she over thinks things and then makes herself think differently like that she wont be able to do this or be able to do that ' im insane ' rose says she thinks that she has no time to write this three thousand word essay because she has work and has to help out with the family she also says that even if she did write the essay she dont tihnk that she would win

17709,7,0,that they are like each other they talk like each other
17710,7,2,based on her conversation with anna one can deduce that a defining characteristic of rose is her selflessness it is evident that she wants nothing more than to help her brother to finish college she is understanding of the family's position and is doing everything in her power to improve it

17719,7,0,she is very angry for some reason
17720,7,0,nosyask to many questiopns
17721,7,0,when rose was talking to her aunt kolab i think that rose is just being selfish and just doesn't want to help out with anything she's basically only thinking about herself 'maybe i can sew for the ladies or make special treats and sell them' her aunts offer made her feel lighter
17722,7,0,i think that she is faithful becuase in both conversations she wants to do something to help in the conversation with anna she wants life to be easier so that they can go to college also in the conversation with her aunt she wants to do something to help people see some thing from their country of cambodia things like sewing some things for women from there or make special treats
17723,7,0,she is very devoted to her school work she won't give up in the story when rose is talking to anna she talks about her essay then when she talks to aunt kolab she talks about her topic for her essay
17724,7,0,that rose and her aunt both know how rose feels in their family situation rose's aunt asks her 'do you really feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family '
17725,7,2,one trait is that rose is a caring person that loves and respects her aunt during her conversation with aunt kolab rose did not expose her dream to her aunt because she did not want to hurt her's or her mother's feelings
17726,7,0,i think rose felt frustrated or weighed down on by her family aunt kolab mentioned to rose that her parents and aunt kolab went through similar situations in cambodia
17727,7,1,based on her conversation with anna the reader can conclude that rose is a strong person for the sake of her younger sister she puts on a brave attitude and sincerely assures her sister that all the promblems and conflicts within the family will soon be ressolved we know that rose works very hard in everything that she does mainly for the sake of her family in the begining of the story we read that rose feels very worried that she won't be able to finish an essay for class do to the fact that her life is too busy work and and taking care of the family however when she is having her conversation with anna rose takes time out of working on her essay and pours two glasses of orange juice for both herself and her sister this suprised me a lot because of how much she stressed on her essay in the begining of the story i believe that this little action shows that rose is a strong and hearfelt person
17728,7,0,she is very wise like in the conversation with anna as she said that they needed to get their parts so thier brother paul can pay for their colleges
17729,7,0,' do you feel so wighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose feels too much pressure on herself she has bad dreams

17731,7,1,rose is a very worrisome person she worries about what her future holds for anna and herself she feels that the weight of the family is coming down on her and can't help but to be bothered by the situation that she is in she feels the her brother will not be able to pull throw and will hurt her and her sisters futures of going to college just as he did my supporting detail is as she lies in the dark she cups her hands and say's 'paul's fate lies partly in these '
17732,7,0,rose is conflicted she feels like she has too much responsibilty in helping the family yet feels like she must help
17733,7,2,caring rose says 'we have to help paul finish college so he can get a good job '
17734,7,0,one trait that describes rose is the way she supresses her true feelings she knows that paul getting a good job and paying for both herself and anna to go to college is basically impossible but she wants to believe it's true so she doesn't have to worry so much one detail to support this would be the when rose cupped her hands and though about how hard it must be for paul to have all of that pressure on his shoulders
17735,7,0,rose is strong in her conversation with aunt kolab she is careful because she doesn't want to reveal to her aunt that she is exhausted from working and going to school rose fears that tis may dissapoint her aunt and her mother she feels weighed down from all of her responsibilites and doesn't think that all of this is necessary but she does this with a good heart
17736,7,2,rose is dedicated but feels pinned down shes wishes for alone time and free time but knows she has the duty of helping her family you know this because she has a part time job and because of what she says to her little sister 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay foe you and me to go to college ' this shows that she feels pressured to help so that she can be helped in return
17737,7,0,rose has a tendency to not let others know how she is really feeling an example of this is in paragraph 11 sentence 2 when 'she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her ' this shows that rose is hiding her true emotions so that she can make anna feel better about their family situation instead of voicing her doubts she laughs in an attempt to brighten the situation

17743,7,1,'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother ' this statement shows that rose feels like she is under a lot of pressure but doesn't want to say anything because she will feel guilty for not helping aunt kolab realizes this and tried to help by saying that things were done differently where they grew up in comparison to rose this helps rose a lot because now she knows that someone is there to help because rose is too young to have to be worrying about helping get money and should be worried about school

17794,7,0,stressed out because she has to help out her family and do her school work
17795,7,1,rose is a hard worker and always is pushing herself to the limit this is proved by her taking on the tasks of helping her aunt as well as the essay even though she is busy she tries to make time for all that is necessary
17796,7,1,hard working from school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework
17797,7,1,rose is helpful because she helps her aunt make dinner
17798,7,1,based on her conversation with her sister anna rose seems to be quite understanding when anna complains to rose about their father being away rose takes the time to explain to anna why it is their father is in that situation instead of instantly reverting back to her own interests rose makes the effort to consider everyone else and absorb the whole situation before talking about it to her sister
17799,7,1,anna is understanding in what is going on with in her family and how she plays a part in working through the situation
17800,7,0,in this story an example used to describe what kind of person rose is would be 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' paragraph 11 line 3 4 reading this and the part of rose talking about her job and school and home life makes me think rose is a person that wants to succeed
17801,7,0,she said that she just wonted to be like a fish and beeenin the water all the time when she was talking to to her aunt she told her she was just misssing her home country of combodian
17802,7,1,durring rose's conversation with anna she sounds like she feels that she has to understand that her pappa has to be away from home and that she has to look after anna and help her family
17803,7,0,rose try's to be thoughtful of her sister and aunt but she has the essay that she has been working on she goes on to say that if she wins we wont get to travel to sacramento to reive the prize she wants
17804,7,2,i would say a good trait to describe rose would be that she is very caring an example from the passage would be when rose professes that 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college ' i beleive this quote shows rose's willingness to sacrifice part of her own happiness to help her brother to gain his own happiness in life only a truly caring person would make such a sacrifice in their life
17805,7,2,one trait that describes rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab is caring in paragraph 19 rose supresses her feelings so that she wouldn't hurt her aunt this is just one example of how rose is a kind and caring person
17806,7,0,that she is stressed out on helpping pay for pauls college funds while shes in school doing work she fell asleep and had a nightmare of paul drowning her with the weight he has bringing
17807,7,2,one trait that can describe rose is respectful she did not tell her aunt the truth about how she felt because rose did not want to hurt her aunt
17808,7,0,based on the two conversations with anna and aunt kolab you can tell rose just wants to get rid of a lot of stress in her life most of the stress is caused by her parents but her brother is also a contributing stress factor
17809,7,2,rose is very understanding we see an example of this in the story during the conversation she had with anna she understood that papa had to work to put paul through college while ana did not seem to be so understanding
17810,7,0,rose seems to be very stressed and has had a lot of responsibility put on her after telling aunt kolab about her dream her aunt looked at her and asked 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family '
17811,7,2,rose is understanding about everything 'we have our part to do to help paul finsh college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
17812,7,1,rose is a dedicated person with a kind heart which is obvious to see as she tries to justify her parents actions to anna and won't risk answering how she truly feels to aunt kolab for fear of hurting her rose is more concerned with the well being and feelings of others than her own and it seems plain as day as you read this story
17813,7,2,she seems like she is overwhelmed she has to do this essay for a state competition 'when would she sqeeze in writing a flawless three thousand word essay ' help her sister calm down to go back to sleep 'i just had another bad dream anna says rose talks to her until she exits to bed she has a job that she is struggling to keep ' and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her ' a family to help take care of ' straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper ' and a lot of expectations to do as her brother did 'she felt too young for so much responsibility imagining how her brother must feel '
17814,7,2,in the story rose is a very mature girl she realizes the pressure that is on her to make her family succeed it shows how mature she is in the story when she explains to her sister the importance of papa being in los angeles rose helps explain things to her younger sister leading her younger sister to say she sounds just like mama
17815,7,0,she is simalar to her mother 'anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table 'you sound just like mama ''
17816,7,0,one characteristic that we see of rose is her sense of realism when rose is talking to anna she talks to her about helping paul finish college toward which anna feels resentment rose talks about money and other worldly things that trouble her
17817,7,0,rose is very busy and has to much on her hands and she doesn't get enough sleep rose goes to school than she goes to work and works a four hour shift than goes home and cooks dinner for her sister and aunt and has to still finsih her homework
17818,7,0,one of rose's traits include being always busy she always has something that she needs to do
17819,7,0,rose is very lonely and she feels very sad like when she had a convorsation with her aunt she wanted to try something new to make her happier
17820,7,2,i would have to say that rose is a hard work because it said she worked a four hour shift after school then came home to help with dinner nd then had to work on her essay
17821,7,2,based on rose's conversation with anna you can tell that she cares for her younger sister and the rest of her family she tries to comfort her sister by gently saying 'it's only been four months ' when her sister talks about how it seems so long that her father has been gone
17822,7,0,that she is real open but hessitent to to say what she really wants to because she doesn't want to hurt aunt if she tells the truth
17823,7,1,the one trait i would use to described rose would be helpful i believe rose is helpful because she not only goes to school but she helps support her family in the story it said that rose's brain must have surrendered to exhaustion and it goes on to explain why rose had a paper to write but she fell asleep because of the school day she had earlier and the four hour shift she had worked at the restraunt prior to her coming home
17824,7,0,rose is a type of person that think s about her furture she can just picture her brother getting he diloma and makeing her parents pround of him knowing that their lives rest in what her brother dose it makes her think about a lot of stuff
17825,7,0,a trait rose has is believing in the passage she is worried at first about her family and isn't sure if things will get better because her mom's never home and her dad doesn't live with them because he got a better job in los angeles that pays three times more than his old job when he lived with them after rose had a talk with her aunt kolab she started believing that she can help make things better and she would do her best to make that happen
17826,7,2,she is really caring and sincere when talking to her aunt she tried to hold in her feelings about her responsibility in the family so she wouldnt offend her aunt or hurt her feelings
17827,7,2,one trait that rose possesses is being compasionate towards others an example of this is when she is talking with anna and says 'anna what's wrong you feel okay '
17828,7,2,rose is worried about if she will be able to go to college or not because it all rests on her brother's shoulders in the story she talks about paul finishing college and getting a good job to pay for them to go to college
17829,7,0,i believe she could be seen as a patient person because in both conversations she listens to anna and her aunt and then gives her opinion on the issue at hand
17830,7,1,when rose was talking to her aunt kolab it showed that she was hard working that she was tired of all the things she had to do for her family
17831,7,0,rose was aften discouraged and did not feel positive towards many things and hurt her loved ones at times
17832,7,0,rose exemplifies the trait of self doubt rose constantly ponders the idea of her life becomming easier but never truly beleives herself when talking to aunt kolab the author states ' rose kept nodding maybe her life would get easier ' rose is showing self doubt in this situation by not thinking her life cause become easier and instead thinking her life may become easier
17833,7,1,in the conversation with anna rose shows that she is encouraging and an optomist she tries to help her sister understand the situation as kindly as possible rose even tries to lighten the situation between anna and her 'she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her ' this shows that she knows the seriousness of the situation yet wants to make her sister happier
17834,7,2,rose never loses hope she always no matter what situation she is going through is hopeful she knows if she pays her dues now and helps get paul through college then he will return the favor
17835,7,2,rose is considerate she works hard on her school work and she does her best at her job so she can help her family even at her young age when rose is talking to aunt kolab she refrains from telling her aunt how she really feels because she doesn't want to hurt her or her family in paragraph 19 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt ' she is considerate of her family's feelings and their situation
17836,7,2,assuring 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and hel'll pay for you and me to go to college '
17837,7,0,rose seems to be the kind of person that although she knows and feels that she has way to much on her plate she doesnt show it in a time like when she was talking to anna when it would be most important that she kept her cool and assured anna that it was going to be alright
17838,7,0,thhey all have regrets in life about one important thing
17839,7,1,rose is hopeful as rose is listening to aunt kolab offering to help she realizes that her life might get easier and that a sense of family could surivive through anything
17840,7,2,the conversation between anna and rose makes rose seem like she is hopeful rose is stressed right now from having a job helping her aunt cook and going to school but in the end she knows her brother will help out when it is her turn a detail from the story is when rose tells anna that paul will get a good job and he will pay for the both of them when they go to college rose knows family is important and she does not give up no matter what the scenario is this story is an excellent example of being there for your family when they need you
17841,7,0,rose is able to be helped 'but her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter '
17842,7,0,rose feels overwhelmed with the burden of responsibility that her family has placed on her her dream of paul's body weighing her down underwater exemplifies this
17843,7,2,rose is very gentle she is very gentle because when her sister anna was talking about how she hated that her father had to go to los angeles to work rose was trying to talk to her and tell her that the job pays more and that it is important and that he was helping them for their futures
17844,7,2,rosa seems to be a hard working young woman despite how weighed down she felt she was willing to do whatever she could to support her family she even got a job and went to school and was struggling to write a very long essay she said to anna that they had their part to do to help their brother finish college
17845,7,2,rose wants to be the big person she wants to preted to be happy and optimistic but she really doesn't on the inside this is brought out especially during her dialougue with aunt kolab she doesn't want to tell aunt kolab the real situation because she is afraid that she will tell her mother this is apparent in paragragh 19 when she thought 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother '
17846,7,0,she go to the high school
17847,7,1,rose is responsible within her family she cares about her sister anna when anna feels disheartened also rose feels that she needs to help out her family and do all she can to help even when it is difficult
17848,7,0,rose seems very selfish when she was talking to anna and she talkes about money and when paul finishes college he will get a good job and pay for anna and hers' anna makes a point that money is not everything it seems like to rose that it is
17849,7,2,rose can be described as a hard worker i think this because of the only line in paragraph seven 'i fell asleep working on my essay ' rose said
17850,7,0,when her sister walked in the room and rose sead what's worng you feel okay
17851,7,2,she is very determined during her conversation with anna she says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college ' for a teen working very hard to put someone else through college is an act that would take a lot of determinition
17852,7,1,rose is young but she is also very responsible working to make some extra money for her family even though she doesnt get to do some of the things she would like to
17853,7,1,cares about family rose goes from school straight to work a four hour shift before she comes home to so her homework so that she can help support her family
17854,7,1,she isn't self centered she realizes how other people sees her situation 'but now i realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes as you should i suppose because you grew up here this must be difficult for you yes 'rose nodded
17855,7,2,rose is caring as you can tell from both of the conversations she had in the story in neither of the conversations does she want to hurt the other ones feelings so rose hides her fellings to make sure the other is not hurt
17856,7,0,rose is curious about her life and if it will ever get easier a detail i can use to support this theory is that in paragraph 23 sentence 2 she worries about her life and the aunt giving her advice that life would get better
17857,7,2,that rose is a thoughtful girl because she wouldn't tell her aunt something that would hurt her
17858,7,2,rose has a trait of unselfishness there is something that is bothering her but she hesitates to share it in fear that it may hurt the people around her this trait is evident in paragraph 19 sentences 1 and 2
17859,7,1,rose is an over all hard worker she has a job she takes care of her sister and she has to go to school
17860,7,2,one trait of rose's is that she is very caring she asked if her sister was ok when anna walked into the room rubbing her eyes
17861,7,1,rose represents herself as a very strong willed person despite the situation that she is in with a geographically distant father and a working mother she is able to live a busy life while working and going to school she maintains the mental health to interact with her family and help them as well though she may feel overwhelmed when rose speaks to her aunt kolab she quickly regains her positivity and moves on this ability to continue under the pressures of a busy life is associated with a strong willed personality possessed by rose
17862,7,0,when she was talking to anna they was sayin that they hate her work sceduile because it was so late then they start talking about there brother paul and rose said somthing about him graduateing from college and that when he does and he gets a good job and saves up money then he will pay for them to go to college as well anna got mad at rose and stormed off
17863,7,0,rose doesn't care about much of anything else besides herself in the story rose just completely ignores her sister after she comes out and says she had a bad dream
17864,7,0,a trait i see in rose is that she tries her best at trying to keep her life togther while keeping a job and doing a three thousand word essay she is a very busy but dedicated person she's a person that likes to take control over the situation but in the end she just seems to become stressed out
17865,7,2,one trait that we can see in rose is that she doesn't like to hurt people this is supported when her aust asks 'do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' she did not answer because she did not want to tell the truth and hurt her aunt
17866,7,0,rose speakes her mind and tells how she feels about things
17867,7,0,rose is very upset with her family she works all the time for her brother and doesn't get anytime for herself to do school work or hang out with friends in paragraph 23 her aunt offers her something that somehow make her feel lighter
17868,7,1,one trait that can describe rose is her loyalty to her family in roses's conversations with aunt kolab rose shows how much she cares for the family even though it is hard for her to go to school and work both at her job and her home rose's dream is an example of this loyalty even though her brother was sinking she didn't leave him until she couldn't go on any longer
17869,7,1,rose is optimistic even when everything seems to be very hard for everyone when she is talking to anna she laughs and tries to lighten up the situation and make it seem better even when it is negatively affecting everyone in the family
17870,7,1,she has patience and lets the problems work out
17871,7,0,if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt

17938,7,0,the trait that can describe rose is she likes to tell others where she came from her background and what she feels about things she talked about where she was and what she disliked about stuff she also is hiding something that is important
17939,7,2,one trait that rose displays in her conversation with aunt kolab is that she is selfless even though rose feels weighed down by her responsibilities she does not complain to her aunt kolab because she knows that it would hurt her feelings roses' life is very difficult but she puts the feelings of her aunt and her mother above her own feelings

17946,7,1,one trait that describes rose would be that she is understanding an example was in the conversation with aunt kolab when whe nods her head as a response
17947,7,2,one trait that i noticed of anna was that she is very caring and has a big heart when she had her dream her aunt had woken her up and she wanted to so badly tell someone but she didn't want to tell her aunt because she didn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings that shows how caring she is and that she has a big heart
17948,7,0,rose is kind of fake for example in paragraph 12 she said i tried a laugh that even sounded fake even to me
17949,7,1,rose is very protective to her family she works had every day by going to school working four hour shift then home to help her aunt rose tries to be the best she can for her family by never giving up even if she is exhausted
17950,7,2,rose is very hopeful in the passage the author states 'rose kept nodding mayber her life would get easier '
17951,7,0,anna is really looking forward to getting all that weight lifted from her shoulder's because she is only in high school and trying to help her mother support their family 'only if you already have everything ' rose said she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her ' we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' paragraph 11
17952,7,0,one triat about rose is that when she tells about her feelings she doesnt really express them too much anna seems the same way like if she does have alot to say and that she feels a certain way she doesnt express it well anna just keeps everything inside like in paragraph 9 10 when anna rose were having a conversation the topic about their father was that rose felt he's been gone forever an that the job he has now in l a pays really good money than the job he had at home ana who look at rose she was like 'money isn't everything' to me it sounded like she is very upset that her dad is so far away and that anna does really miss him
17953,7,0,she understands and listens to what others have to say when anna was talking to her rose helped her out she explained and help rose understand some things she tried her best to make anna not feel so lonely when she had a conversation with aunt kolab rose didn't really talk about much she doesn't like to talk about her feelings she likes to keep her feelings bottled up inside
17954,7,0,one trait that describes rose is overwhelmed i think rose is overwhelmed because of the 3 000 word essay that she has to write to help get her brother into college and also haveing to work a job and help make supper
17955,7,0,one trait of rose is she is very faithful she wants her family to be happy even if she is not you can tell this when she is talking to anna telling her that everything will turn out for the best it will just take some time
17956,7,0,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab would be that rose is a very busy girl with very little time on her hands ' the day like most of her days had been too long too demanding from school she's gone straight to the resturant to work a four hour shift then go straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper
17957,7,2,rose is caring because when her sister walks in rubbing her eyes the first thing rose asks her is if she is alright
17958,7,2,rose is caring when she talks to other people because when she was talking with her aunt she thinks 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt ' this shows that she cares about how other people feel
17959,7,0,according to this particular story rose is depicted as discouraged the story explains how aunt kolab asked rose if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help her family and rose had no response signifying a sense of discourageness or hopelessness
17960,7,0,rose feels in urgent need to relate to her dreams but yet she is very exposed to the fact that the truth might hurt she is starting to relize she needs to see things throught others eyes not just her own
17961,7,0,stressed because she is in a situatuion where she has to support her family and when she talks to her aunt she expresses her stressfulness
17962,7,1,rose wants the best for her family because she talks to her sister about going to coledge
17963,7,1,she is a very worried person that has alot riding on her shoulder so that she can go to collage and then send monry back so that her sister can go
17964,7,2,rosa tries not to upset others she tries to make them feel better by saying 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' to anna
17965,7,2,rose is very sincere in paragraph 8 sentence 1 it says that rose said ' it's only been four months ' as gently as she could she wanted to help her realize why and wanted to do it so anna wouldn't get mad at her
17966,7,0,i think that rose is stubborn because when she and her sister were talking shen got mad and walked out of the kitchen
17967,7,2,she tries to be the mother of the family for her sister anna 'its only been four months ' rose said as gently as she could 'he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here '
17968,7,1,in the story rose feels that she is having to work on things and can not get them done she feels that the weight of the world is resting on her shoulders in her second dream when she dreams that she swam through clear green tinted water she is struggling to get out from under her brothers weight when he accidentally jumps into the water on top of her this symbolizes that she can't get out from the image that her brother has set for her to live up to when she talks with her aunt after the dream she feels that someone understands that she is going through a lot and that she just needs to do what she will to get through it one trait in the story that stood out is that she is a hard worker and that she feels that she can't live up to the standards that her brother set for her to accomplish
17969,7,0,she trys to help her sister out when she thinks her father is not spending enough time at home with their mother rose tells her sister that their father had to go and that the job paid more and it would help to go to college
17970,7,2,she is always looking to the future like in the second sentance of paragraph 23 she said 'maybe her life would get easier'
17971,7,0,one trait that best describe rose based on her conversations with anna is hateful she didn't like the fact that her mom is working extra hours at work also she hated that her father is gone away on a bussiness trip
17972,7,0,rose had many traits in this story but one that stud out to me was her welling to do everthing she gos to school works helps her aunt and deffends her father about what anna is saying
17973,7,0,rose was always determined to write the paper and win the trip she never really enjoyed the paper but she set her mind to it
17974,7,1,rose is very determined because when she first talks to anna she doesn't seem to care about what rose is trying to accomplish then when she talks to aunt kolab she knows almost automaticly what she wants to write about thanks to her aunt forgiving her encouragement
17975,7,1,a trait that describes rose would be her great helping attitude with her family after school she would go to the restaurant and work four hour shifts then she would go home and help aunt kolab with supper for the family after that she had time to work on her homework she put the needs of others before the needs of herself
17976,7,0,she was stressed about the competition and how she was going to enter when she has a job to attend to she talks about this and the dream she had because she was also conserned if it meant something in her life that has been currently being going on to support this answer she says 'even if i were to win she thought i won't get to travle to sacramento to recieve the prize '
17977,7,0,anna is a dreamer not in a sense of sleep but of ambitions she's always talking about going other places like the green tinted water in her dream
17978,7,1,responsible would be a trait to describe rose she has a job to pay for paul's college
17979,7,0,one of anna's traits is that she is jealous of paul because he is in college she gets mad when other people try to stand up for him one example is this passage is when rose told anna that paul will get a good job after college and even pay for them to go to college she just rolled her eyes pushed the chair aways from the table and told rose she sounded just like their mom
17980,7,0,rose is first of all stressed out because of the things going on in her life with school working a 4 hour shift at a resteraunt coming home and helping the family with supper and then homework and sure enough it'd be time for bed soon after so during her conversations with anna and aunt kolab you can tell she has a stressed out tone and is very serious about getting the things she needs to get done done
17981,7,0,she feels her life is hard since she is trying to help the family get through hard times aunt kolab 'do you feel so weighd down by what you're doing to help this family '
17982,7,2,rose is sensitive and cares about others feelings when rose was thinking that if she told the tuth about how she was feeling and thinking that she would hurt her aunt's feeling's it shows how she feels about tother's feelings
17983,7,0,rose feels weighed down by what she is doing to help her family but cannot tell her aunt kolab because she would hurt her aunt's feelings this trait comes from rose's conversation with aunt kolab when aunt kolab asks her 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family '
17984,7,2,one trait that can describe rose is supportive as rose talks to anna in this story she keeps telling anna how everything will work out rose has other thoughts about the situation but she keeps them to her self to make her younger sister feel better about the situation she tells anna 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' this shows that rose no matter how weighted down she feels will always give a supportive answer for her sister to make things seem alright
17985,7,2,rose is mature for her age therefore she can understand the importance of everything that her family is doing an example from the story would be 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
17986,7,0,in this short story rose is having a conversation with her sister about how she is sad that her papa has to work somewhere else for money it states 'she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her rose ' which tells the reader that rose is trying to hide how tired she is and the ridiculous amount of responsibility she has for her family from that aspect of the story rose seems like a very brave young girl to work hard for her family
17987,7,2,respectful 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt '
17988,7,1,rose seems to care more about family then a lot of things i think that the reason she is having bad dreams is because she stressing so much about her family and the 3 thousand word essay that she has to write and hasn't done yet but i think that she just had to realize what he most important thing was after all
17989,7,1,she worries about everyone except herself she feels that she has to take on a big responsibility for her family
17990,7,2,rose is very strong willed because when anna said to her 'money isn't everything ' rose immediately snapped back and disagreed with her
17991,7,0,when rose wanted to expres who she feel and the dream she had but she didn' know how to a example is when 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother '
17992,7,1,rose wants to help her brother get to college to get a good job in the future so her and her sister can hopefully go to college someday one detail from the story is when she says that her brother has both of his little sisters fate in his hands
17993,7,0,rose has a lot of stress and responsibiltiies after telling her aunt about the dream
17994,7,0,she is scared 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother'
17995,7,0,she is only thinging about the money end of life and not about living for the moment anna tells her this by saying 'money is not everything'
17996,7,2,i believe that two obvious traits that rose possesses is hope and courage though she was troubled by how her life had been upon talking to her aunt she felt a lighthearted peace within herself she knew that things may or may not change but she also knew she could make the best of whatever happened
17997,7,0,she does not tell the truth to her aunt so she does not hurt her
17998,7,2,i think her conversation with anna made her seem like she is a very caring person of how she was asking whats wrong or are u feeling ok
17999,7,0,dragged because of the dream she had the night before that she told her aunt
18000,7,0,rose has a positive attitude towards papa being gone she reminds her sister why he's gone and points out he will be able to pay for thier college when he is done working
18001,7,0,rose is guarded she doesn't want to let her guard down and this is obvious when her laugh 'sounded fake even to her'
18002,7,2,one trait that can describe rose is selfless during the conversation with aunt kolab rose doesnt want to answer aunt kolab's question or tell the truth about her true feelings of being such a big part in supporting the family rose didnt want to hurt aunt kolab or make her feel bad
18003,7,0,rose felt tha her life would get easier
18004,7,1,rose is a hard worker she takes many things upon herself such as helpinh her brother graduate
18005,7,0,i find her stubborn or rude really in her conversation with anna anna is upset because her father is away rose completely subsides the sadness anna feels and begins speaking of money
18006,7,2,one treat that can describe rose would be positivety during her conversation with anna rose told her that they have their part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job and that he'll pay for anna and her to go to college even during hard times rose still told anna that eventually things would work out and they would get to go to college as well as paul
18007,7,0,she is busy because she has school work and help make dinner it also says 'when would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand word essay '
18008,7,2,hopeful maybe her life would get easier
18009,7,0,from hearing her aunt's point of view rose not only found her topic for her essay she felt lighter from her aunt's offer to help her rose kept nodding maybe her life would get easier maybe it wouldn't but her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter suddenly it occurred to her here was the topic for her essay although it was still vague cambodian tradition and sense of family she realized could survive an ocean crossing
18010,7,2,anna is very caring about other people's feelings in paragraph 19 it reveals anna didnt want to hurt her aunt kolabs feelings if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
18011,7,0,based on her conversations with anna and aunt kolab rose seems to have trouble with internal conflicts she is fighting a war with herself that makes her feel that she has too much resposibility placed on herself for all of the work she has done for her older brother she wonders how her life would be different if she had not been forced to do so much work
18012,7,0,one trait that can describe rose when she is talking to aunt kolab is when she thinks that her life might get easier maybe it won't but she has a topic for her paper
18013,7,2,rose is very responsible and she states 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college '
18014,7,1,rose is patient she tells anna how all their struggles will be worthwhile when paul pays for them to go to college
18015,7,0,one trait rose has is maturity matuirty is represented in paragraph nine when rose is explaining why her dad had to move away she is explaining it like it is what is best for the household
18016,7,0,one trait that i believe can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is calm i think this is a good trait to describe rose because while she was talking to her younger sister anna she came up with reasons to help her sister understand why her father and mother are out working and not there with them another reason is because while her aunt was talking to her her aunt was talking about ways to make rose feel better as rose listened to her aunts suggestions she calmly nodded her head in agreement to her aunt
18017,7,0,one trait that can describe rose is stress why i say stress is because in the begining she is getting home from having to work all the time also she has a long essay to write along with fixing food with all of this going on its going to cause stress on her which is causing her dreams since she realizes this she goes and talks to her aunt even if she wanted to hold it all inside
18018,7,1,she is someone who can get very discouraged easily cause she is always worried about how late her mom has to work also about getting all her homework done then going strait to work she thinks she is always pushed for time
18019,7,1,that rose always had a understand of her aunt kolab because she will kno what her aunt will do
18020,7,0,she has alot of frustration in side that she wants to let out but has to hold back and the reason that i think this is because she says if she would of answered and told the truth she would of hurt her aunt
18021,7,1,when rose is talking to anna in the kitchen you get the sense that rose wants to please her family she feels weighted down by all she has to do yet she puts on a smile and attempts to act like she's fine when rose and anna are talking about money rose tries to make light of the subject by making a joke and laughing although her laugh sounds fake even to her
18022,7,1,in the convorsation rose had with her younger sister anna she seem to be strong she was being postive about the situation with her father i feel she was being this way towards her sister to give her comfort and make it seem like things arnt as bad as they seem
18023,7,0,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is with aunt kolab rose is an american she doesn't remeber cambodia therefore aunt kolab has to teach her of cambodia with aunt kolab deciding to bring a little of cambodia to america when aunt kolab says 'hmm maybe we can find a way to do things differently a way better for you ' and 'maybe i can sew for ladies or i could make special treats from our country and sell them '
18024,7,0,in rose's conversation with anna rose's leadership shines through despite her exhaustion and discouragment rose patiently encourages her sister rose reminds anna of the overall goal of paul's graduation and him paying for their own college education rose overlooks her own problems to help lead her sister
18025,7,0,rose seems dedicated because even during her talk with aunt kolab she thinks of something she could use for her essay in the beggining of the story it talks about how even though she has so many other things to handle she still makes time to write her essay
18026,7,1,rose seems to be a very caring character throughout this story when she talks to anna and tries to make her feel better her caring personality shines through to the readers
18027,7,2,rose is very caring an example of this trait can be seen when she asks anna if she is alright after asking her if she was ok she went and poured her a glass of orange juice
18028,7,2,rose is determined she's not only worried about herself but paul also rose said 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college ' she's willing to do whatever it takes for her family so paul can get a good job and her and her sister anna can go to college
18029,7,0,she is a very egar person
18030,7,0,faith in the story she says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job '
18031,7,0,they both worry
18032,7,0,'only if you have everything ' rose always seems negative with no hope
18033,7,0,rose is misrible and she knows it however she tries not to show it and wants to stay strong for the sake of the rest of her family aunt kolab asks rose 'do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose didn't want to answer her aunt out of fear of harming her or her mother to rose other peoples' feelings matter more
18034,7,0,one trait to describe rose would be pressured rose is constantly busy her job family and a three thousand word essay are occuping her time 'in cambodia our first country what we're all doing would be quite normal ' rose's aunt said to rose near the end of the passage this detail suggests that rose's aunt and parents are used to the pressure that they might not be able to see things through an american girl's eyes
18035,7,0,rose was fed up with everything she had to do and she wanted her dad to come home she still worked and did her homework rose did not complain so i would say she is patient
18036,7,2,rose is very caring she encourages her sister that everything is going to be alright and life will get better for them even though she is feeling doubtful in herself she assures anna that their dad is away to make things better for them and be able to send them both to college
18037,7,2,she is always hopeful 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
18038,7,2,i think rose seems to be caring about not just herself but of her family in the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling she cares fro paul she also helps out aunt kolab
18039,7,0,they both have attitudes
18040,7,0,she is very mature because of the way that she talks to her sister about helping the family out at such a young age
18041,7,0,she feels very stressed out why is that because the story says 'she felt to young for so much responsibility'
18042,7,1,helpful greatful and loving money isn't everything
18043,7,0,she is a very worryfilled person when she states that she dreamt of the weight of her brother on her shoulders in the water
18044,7,1,she seems very confident that something may happen when she was having a conversation with her sister in the kitchen she looked at the positive of their father working is los angeles
18045,7,0,anna is stuggling hoping her life would get easer
18046,7,1,rose can be described as hardworking in this story she is very hardworking because she goes straight from school to her job and then home to help aunt kolab cook supper
18047,7,0,she's a little grumpy because when she comes in sounds like she's giving attitude to everyone which dont make her look good
18048,7,0,one trait that rose has is that she is very cautious of others feelings and tries to not upset them an example of this trait would be when aunt kolab asked rose if she felt weighted down by what she was doing for the family and to avoid hurting aunt kolab she didn't respond
18049,7,1,she is very weighed down but at the same time she is doing it cause she has to help her family she is a very giving person by giving up her time to work for her brother and make money for him to finish colledge 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after thst it ws time to do homework '
18050,7,0,she is very unopen with how she really feels to the rest of the family even though she is struggling with everything she tries to make them see positive
18051,7,1,rose shows that she can be very understanding of other peoples' thoughts when she was talking to her sister she tried to show that she understood how her sister felt when she was talking to her aunt she understood that life in cambodia was much different than hers
18052,7,0,burdened 'his body sank as if it were made of stone pushing her beneath him down under him but he seemed unaware of her '
18053,7,0,rose wants to please the people in her family she often held back from expressing her true emotions in order to spare the feelings of the others in her family for example in paragraph 19 rose held back from telling her aunt kolab that she did feel weighted down by helping her family
18054,7,0,i believe that rose is overwhelmed by having to go to school and work one example is that her aunt offers to sew for ladies or make special treats from their home country and sell them to bring in some extra money
18055,7,0,in the story rose changes the subject when anna reveals that she had had a bad dream this shows me that rose is too concerned about her own problems also aunt kolab starts offering to do extra work so that rose wouldn't have to do as much work and this also shows to me that she is to concentrated on how busy she is
18056,7,2,she dosen't want to hurt her aunt's feelings so she doesn't anwser her aunt that proves she cares for her family and is a kind and caring person it decribes her
18057,7,1,one trait that can be described about rose is that she is a very hard working person who just wants the best out of her familys' life one detail from the story that represents my answer is when she was talking to anna about how she was explaining the situation about the family and how if they help paul finish college he could get a good job and help support the family
18058,7,2,on trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with aunt kilab is that she cares about others' feelings 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt '

18060,7,1,one trait is haveing to help others no matter what it takes and seeing what other people think about things i no this from the conversation with her aunt and her aunt thinks the same way as rose does
18061,7,0,one tof many traits rose has is selfishness rose knows deep down the troubles and problems she has most people have also but rose makes it seem like she only cares about herself for example her sister told her she had a bad dream and all rose had to talk about was her essay
18062,7,1,one trait that can describe rose is that she is hard working one detail from the story that can support my answer is that she goes strait from school to her job which is a four hour shift and then when she gets home from work she goes right to doing her homework
18063,7,0,her trait is that she can see things form another's point of view eplination when her and rose were talking she was looking at the situation from pauls point of view
18064,7,0,i think one trait that describes rose is that she sounds like her mom when anna and her are talking on paragraph 12 ' you sound just like mama '
18065,7,0,i think rose tries to help the family out a lot but being so young and trying to do everything is hard for her while rose was talking to her aunt kolab her aunt said 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose only nodded and fell silent i think this shows that rose is young and does a lot for her family
18066,7,2,one trait that can descibe rose would be that she is opptimistic she keeps thinking everything is going to get easier in the last paragraph she is thinking maybe my life will get easier
18067,7,0,she doesn't want others to be upset and keeps her bad comments to herself she is not use to the way they are living because she didn't grow up in cambodia

18069,7,0,a trait that rose has is overworking herself she goes to school goes to work and worries about finishing her essay assignment she's so involved with her family struggles and her job that she can not even take the trip to sacramento if her essay is the best
18070,7,0,that she is very selfish because she thinks that everything needs to help her via the quotations of her saying that it isnt fair that their dad has been gone for 4 months
18071,7,1,rose wants to help her family no matter the cost this shows that rose is an unselfish person as stated in the story 'paul's fate lies partly in these she thought she felt too young for so much responsibility then she shivered imagining how her brother must feel only three years older he held the fate of two people both his sisters in his hands '

18156,7,2,rose is very caring she is doing everything she can to make ends meet for her family while she is still very young she wants to help paul her brother finish college so when he gets done he will help her and her sister get through college the passage states 'then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
18157,7,0,she is feeling ashumed becaused she feels that she is depended on to much then a normal teenager should be depened on she tells aunt kolab about the dream that is the exemaple that is being used
18158,7,0,she takes resonsibility for her family because after her four hour shift she go straight home and helps her aunt with supper
18159,7,2,one trait that can identify rose is hopeful when rose talks to anna she tried to make things seem better than they actually were 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'
18160,7,0,rose feels like she has alot of stress on her to complete duty that have to be done she said ' her brain must have surrendered to exhaustion ' that lets the readers know shes dealing with stress that has her overwhelmed
18161,7,1,rose has an over developed sense of responsibility as she is pressured to work herself into exhaustion to help support her brother she feels an obligation to work yet she does not like it her aunt asks her if she feels 'so weighed down by what she's doing to help this family ' she suppresses her answer which shows that she is embarassed by it so it must be yes once her aunt offers to help support the family rose feels 'lighter ' her family's culture prevents her from freeing her burdens from herself and that causes her to become responsible
18162,7,2,when rose is speaking with anna rose says that they must help out sence there brother is trying to get through collage so he can pay for them to go to collage
18163,7,0,she feels like she is not responsible her parents and family are counting too much on her
18164,7,1,she is trying to find a way to help her family she needs help because she feels gilty for something she couldn't stop

18167,7,2,rose is not living an easy life but she is doing what she can to make the best of it one trait rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork rose goes to school and has a part time job i know from first hand experience that that is very hard work juggling the two is very stressful at times when rose explains what her day consisted of it truely shows that she is a hardworker and is striving to achieve a greater goal 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework ' paragraph 1 this example shows how busy she is but it also proves how hard she must be working
18168,7,0,i'm not sure if being depressed is a trait but i feel like rose is very stressed out when her sister tells her that she had a bad dream rose completely ignore her i believe that rose wasn't ignoring her on purpose but had her mind on a million things and couldn't focus
18169,7,2,during rose's conversation with her aunt the passage says 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt ' i think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone she feels like it's her duty to help her brother through college and to protect her aunts feelings in a lot of ways she has the leadership trait
18170,7,1,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations is she is responsible an example of this is when rose was talking to her sister anna rose is worried about the family and how they don't have enough money while anna isn't worried about it because she believes all she needs is family rose knows that if they want paul to graduate college then they are going to need more money that's rose's main concern
18171,7,0,rose feels over worked and feels like she has to do everything by herself she feels like she has no time to do anything 'when would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand word essay ' par 3 sent 1
18172,7,1,rose is hard working she goes to school then she goes to work then she comes home and helps with dinner then she does her homework that is alot to do in such a short time period
18173,7,0,rose is really trying not to let her feelings show 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt '
18174,7,0,rose seems to be so tired and frustrated with how busy and different her life is that she doesn't feel like doing anything she seems like she doesn't want to hurt anybody's feelings such as her aunt when she asks if she feels so weighed down by what she was doing to help her family it seems like rose just needs a break and a day to relax to get back to normal
18175,7,0,rose is a good listener and can make good judgement calls
18176,7,0,she is lonely
18177,7,1,rose is vey independent she knows what she has to do in order to have the life that she wants and she will do whatever it takes when anna tells her that money isn't everythings rosa replies ' only if you already have everything we have our part to do to help paul finish college '
18178,7,0,rose is trustworthy she listens to what people say and believes that everything will work out in the end in her conversation with anna she repeated what her mom said would happen after her brother gets out of college showing just how much she trusts them
18179,7,0,the trait that i think rose on her conversations is she should be more like anna cause rose thinks more like anna and then rose tries to do her three paragraph eassy
18180,7,0,one trait that could describe rose based on her conversations with her sister and aunt would be conflicted 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
18181,7,0,she is very strest out of all the things she has to do she is tierd of all the things in her life that she has to do
18182,7,2,one trait that describes rose would be hopeful because from the story she tell her sister 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'
18183,7,2,in her conversation with anna the reader can see that rose realizes the extent of her responibilities and duties to her family specifically her brother however she shows that she wants to appear mature to anna and instead of telling her how she really felt she tries to look at the situation from a practical and adult like viewpoint and appears 'just like mama ' rose's responses to anna such as 'money isn't everything' show that she is unwilling and embarassed for anna to see how she really feels
18184,7,0,she want to tell her sister how she really feel may be its because she does not want her sister to worry she tells her sister that she is fine and that nothings wrong but her sister nows better when she is talking to her aunt she says nothing to her at all her aunt tries to talk to her but nothing exept at the end of the conversation she at least nodes at her aunt she feels very overwelmed
18185,7,1,rose is a very positve person this trait is shown when rose remains positive when talking to anna for she does not want to upset her
18186,7,1,rose wants to be a helper by doing things to help her family get through the hard time as she said 'maybe i can sew for ladies'

18193,7,0,she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help the family the detail is that she does not want to answer and tell her aunt the truth because it might make her sad
18194,7,2,one trait that i found that could describe rose is she is a kind person one example of this is when rose is talking to her aunt and her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by what you are doing to help this family what rose did not say should how she was a kind person in paragraph 19 when she does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings shows how rose is a kind person

18204,7,1,rose is empathetic and can understand what others are going through even when she is haveing a hard time example she felt too young for so much responsibility then she shivered imaginining how her brother must feel only three years older he held the fate of two people both his sisters in his hands
18205,7,1,she cares a lot about her family and she doesn't want to let anyone down one example in the story is she says ' i feel like i got a lot of responibilty and i have no idea what to do '
18206,7,0,rose is a little bit selfish when her sister came into the kitchen form just having a bad dream rose didn't say anything but 'i fell asleep working on my essay ' instead of comfortig anna
18207,7,0,roes thinks that she's the only one trying to do good for the family when she speaks with anna she has a tone about her that explains how she thinks she knows everything but she also felt to young for all the responsibility that paul put on her that's why she couldn't tell her aunt about her dream
18208,7,2,rose is hardworking she goes to school then heads off to the resaurant she works at for her four hour shift heads home to help her aunt make a quick super and then she started on her homework
18209,7,1,rose has a very devoloped sense of family she didnt want to answer aunt kolab's question beacsue she thought it might hurt her aunt or her mother would be upset she also decided to write her essay on the topic of cambodian tradition and that same sense of family
18210,7,1,anna feels like she needs to do her part in helping the family out but she feels like it is taking away from her life as in not having time to do what she wants such as writing her essay
18211,7,0,she's not used to the business of america like her aunt says 'in cambodia what we're all doing would be quite normal now i realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes as you should i suppose because you grew up here' aunt kolab means how rose is more used to the way life went in cambodia then the way life goes in america
18212,7,1,a trait that rose has is caring about her family she's not selfish at all in the story rose states that money isn't everything and even though she missed her father she understood that he had to go to los angeles for the money
18213,7,1,one trait that can describe rose is hard working the author of the story says that she feels she needs to do her part to help paul get through college she is working to help him because she knows he will return the favor to both her and anna
18214,7,0,i can tell that she is very open minded about things that she has to say and she doesnt have an attitude problem and she loves her little sister
18215,7,1,rose seems like a person that is caring she seems willing to help her family even though she is having a difficult time with everything going on just as it says she has an essay to write work school and other things at home
18216,7,0,confused because she has an urge to talk about it with people to find out what to think of it
18217,7,0,she tries to hide the way she feels rose does it by not telling her aunt how she feels when she asks if everything is ok
18218,7,0,rosa is always busy she never has time to do anything she always goes to school then she turns around and goes to work when she is done there she goes home and helps her aunt cook a quick supper she is a very busy girl she hardly ever has time to do anything
18219,7,0,the conversation with her aunt kolab was good when the one with her sister anne was not so good
18220,7,0,rose seems like she is not verry caring to anyone and i think this because of how she was rude to anna in their conversation
18221,7,0,she sticks up for her mom and dad in the story rose and anna started talking about their mom's job and how she works so late and how her dad had to leave for a job that payed almost three times as much and how she hated it but rose stood up for them and said they had too
18222,7,1,one trait rose has is that she is a hard worker she has to work go to school and fine time to do homwork but she gets is done
18223,7,2,when rose is talking to anna she tries to tell her sister how much she cares for paul to get his education in college that way so that he can pay for her and anna to go to college
18224,7,1,rose is a caring person in the way that even though she feels strongly about a cause she doesn't want to concern the rest of the family with the matter so she keeps it to herself
18225,7,0,she is not rude when she told her dream she was not rude about it she was more respectful
18226,7,0,'we have to do our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
18227,7,0,rose is kind with her sister she shows this by being compasionate with her sister when she wakes up in the middle of the night and she explains that dad left because the pay was three times what it is where they live
18228,7,2,rose is a sympathetic person who does not want to hurt her relative's feelings after rose's aunt asks rose if she feels overwhelmed with responsibilities rose does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunt's feelings or her mother's feelings
18229,7,0,anna gets angered really easily an example of this would be while talking to rose she tells anna one thing and she storms off to her room
18230,7,2,rose can be described as considerate because she is reluctant to tell her aunt kolab that she feels very weighed down by her familial obligations because she fears her aunt may be hurt the author writes 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother '
18231,7,0,resentful she is trying to just push away her feelings by hiding how she really feels about her dad going away for his job
18232,7,0,it seems like to me that she tries her hardest to make light of the situtaion with her and her sister she made a joke about money anna said that money wasn't everything and rose tried to make a joke and said 'only if you have everything'
18233,7,1,rose is strong she manages to comfort anna instead of giving into the tiredness she feels
18234,7,2,she is responsible at least she feels responsible for everyone if she didn't she would have ignored anna and got on her paper but istead she tried to comfort her and make her see the situation differently and that it will change
18235,7,0,rose's charcter can best be decribed as stressed she had to take on so much responibility for her families sake and she just can't take it like when she didn't say anything after her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by her family she didn't say anything because she didn't want to up set her aunt but she secretly wnated to say yes
18236,7,0,rose is busy a lot and does the best she can i say that because of this quote 'from school she'd gone staright to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper '
18237,7,1,rose is a overcaring person she care for her family and want to help however the story shows that she is far too concerned and feels as if she must support the entire family by herself it is proven to the reader that this is true when she has the nightmare she envisions the weight of her brother unbearable and she strugles to survive ultimately she is drowned when she attempts to tell her brother to get off of her and water enters her lungs this suggests that she feels that she must help her brother get into college and her family get money and that she feels guilty for her shortcomings
18238,7,0,rose likes to caarry the weight of the world on her shoulders
18239,7,0,i think that rose worries a lot and that she is afraid of hurting others and that she is afraid to express her real feelings it says that she was afraid to tell the truth because she thought she would hurt her aunt rose doesn't trust her voice because she doesn't want to say anything offensive and therefore most of the coversation she had with her aunt she remained quiet she seemed ashamed at even telling her aunt the dream but felt she had to so she wouldn't feel alone
18240,7,0,one trait that describes rose would be fighter she fights to keep a job and go to school she fights through being tired to help her aunt with her sister she fights with knowing that her essay and her dream to winning that award may not come true becuase she loves her family enough to help out
18241,7,0,she dont care when her sister anna was talking to her she did not care what she was ssaying because she started on another subject
18242,7,0,rose is an overachiver because she has to do so many things and yet she still participates in things she had to do a flawless three thousand word essay if she wins she gets to go to sacramento to receive the prize when she was talking to aunt kolab it is obvius that the kolab knows what she is going through and that going on this trip will relax her but at the same time bulid up stress and anxiouty for when they get back
18243,7,0,scared and troubled if you ask me i think she is scared to not able to support her brother are help him she is troubled because she is not seeing a way to help she just took it in her hands
18244,7,0,rose is quite uncaring considering how she ignores her sister and how she complains that she does too much work
18245,7,1,rose is responsible because she goes to work making money to help her family out she does this while also keeping up with her school work and with urge to help her family
18246,7,0,she is understanding like she understands why papa has been gone
18247,7,1,i would describe rose as comforting she tried her best to make her sister feel better and understand the situations taking place within the family when she woke up from a bad dream
18248,7,1,one trait that describes rose would be hard working she goes to school all day long then works a four hour shift and helps out around the house she knows that her family needs her help and even though she is completely exhausted she still does everything that needs to get done
18249,7,2,she's caring towards her family memebers when her and anna talk about money and paul on his way to college rose is concerned about him getting in
18250,7,2,rose is veryunderstanding in the story rose understandes why her dad has to work in los angeles and tries to get anna to understand as well

18256,7,0,one trait that rose claims is the fact that she does not wish to hurt her family members although she is very stressed out when her aunt asks 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunt's feelings
18257,7,0,when she talks to both of them it seems like she does not want them to worry about her because in both of the conversations she avoids telling them how she truely feels and whats wrong to keep them from worring
18258,7,0,even though things are not going so well in the family rose tries to make the mood lighter by trying to laugh that sounded fake even to her
18259,7,2,hopeful because when anna mentions missing papa rose assured her that they didn't need him and that if they were to help paul finish college and get a good job and then he could pay for them to go to college
18260,7,1,rose is a very mature young woman you can see this when she explains to her sister why her mom and dad do the things that they do to get money it would be very easy for her to complain but she doesn't and this shows her maturity
18261,7,0,rose's family is always busy working her mother and father and even herself after school for a four hour shift
18262,7,0,when rose talks to anna 'only if you already have everything ' she feels guilty

18264,7,2,rose is a very giving and thoughtful person rose is helping her family by getting an education and even though her aunt asked of she felt weighed down for what she was doing for her her family rose didnt tell her the truth on how she really felt
18265,7,2,i can see that rose tries to be positive about life with her sister anna when she is telling her sister that they have to do their part so her brother can finish college and pay for rose and anna's college
18266,7,0,rose is a very conflicted person although she loves her family she feels resentful that she has to put so much time and effort toward trying to support them for example when she is trying to convince anna that supporting paul is important she doesn't completely agree with what she is saying 'she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her'
18267,7,1,rose is a hard worker and is trying to do her part to help her family for example rose states that anna and her have to do their part to help paul finish college
18268,7,0,tired i fell asleep working on my essay
18269,7,1,rose is understanding we learn this through the conversation with anna she realizes what she is doing is for the good of her brother and her family

18274,7,0,rose feels that she is being weighed down with all this responsibility of helping the family she told her aunt about her dream and her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by what she was doing for the family
18275,7,1,roses trait would be that she is strong emotionaly i know this because even when she is stressed and sleepy she helped her sister when she needed it
18276,7,0,one detail is that she is tried from work school and homework and she has to get ans essay done for a state compition
18277,7,1,i think one trait of rose from the conversation with anna makes her seem like she really likes her dad and wants him to be there but understands that he has to make more money for the family i also think she is the one that is overwellmed with this essay and is stressed out
18278,7,1,one trait that could describe rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab is hard working in paragraph eighteen her aunt says 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' this shows that rose is working extremely hard to help her family out financially

18294,7,1,she works hard 'the day like most of her days had been too long '

18298,7,1,one trait that can be identiried based on the conversations between rose and her aunt kolab is that rose understands and knows she needs to help out her family she feels guilty for not wanting to help out when her aunt asked rose wether or not she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help their family rose didn't answer because she did feel weighted down she just wanted to do what was right by that particular converstation a reader can see that rose is respectful and only wants to do whats right to help her family

18302,7,0,rose seems like a very smart girl and that she is trying to gather information off of what her aunt said
18303,7,1,a trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab would be that they are both hard wroking a detail would be that aunt kolab offered to find a job to help out with rose being so weighed down

18305,7,0,when her and her sister talk in the kitchen and get in a fight
18306,7,2,rose seems hardworking and matierialistic in her conversation with anna she seems this way to me not only because she fell asleep working on her essay but because she thinks it's okay for her paul to move away from his family just because it is a better job that is better paying while ana believes family should come before work and money
18307,7,2,rose cares deeply for her sister despite the hopelessness that she feels she tries to make her sister anna feel better about the situation when in line 12 she says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' despite her internal struggle rose pretends that things will work out to give her sister a sense of hope
18308,7,0,based on this story rose's one trait that i can tell is that she feels like she has so much to live up to because from the dream she had with her brother pushing her into the bottom of the ocean and her conversation with her aunt kolab she seems stressed like she needs to take some pressure off herself

18316,7,2,rose is family oriented she cares about her family when her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by this family she did not reply this shows that she did not want to hurt the family
18317,7,1,the way the author describes rose is a caring person who wants the best for her family the example the author gives for this is when she was talking to anna the comment 'money isn't everything ' this comment shows how she doesn't want her familly apart from each other
18318,7,1,rose is a realist she knows from her conversation with her little sister that money is important her little sister does not know how important money is to the world rose understands and looks at thing how they are
18319,7,0,rose was a good sister she had been feeling so stressed about trying to do the essay and trying to work at the same time but she still took time to make sure her sister was alright rose suppressed her own feelings and talked to anna like everything was going to be okay

18323,7,2,rose seems to be a caring person her sister walks in looking depressed and she seems to care about how she feels by asking her about it
18324,7,1,she is a very hard worker like most of her days it had been to long too demanding from school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework

18328,7,1,rose is hopeful because of her conversation with aunt kolab aunt kolab offers to help rose and tries to put herself in rose's shoes aunt kolab explains her experiences were different when she was growing but tries to imagine what rose is feeling aunt kolab's sincerity causes rose to determine what to write about for her essay this lifts some of the burden off of rose an she starts to have a hopeful look towards life
18329,7,2,rose is considerate because in paragraph 19 she is hesitant to tell her aunt the truth because she is unsure if it will hurt her
18330,7,2,one trait that can describe rose is that she is comforting this trait is displayed in her conversation with anna when she asks how she is feeling and when she tries to make the time their father has been gone seem shorter

18333,7,2,she is hard working all the time she goes to school then works 4 hour shifts after school then helps fix supper
18334,7,2,i think that she doesn't like to tell people about the way she actually feels because she's afraid that it might hurt someone in the family or make them worried when she was talking to her aunt she didn't mention her dream to her even though that's what she felt like she should do to make herself feel better
18335,7,0,one trait that rose has is that she is overwhelmed and kind of frightened she thinks that she wants to tell aunt kolab about her dream because she thinks that it will relieve stress on her
18336,7,1,one trait that rose posseses is that she is motherly while talking to anna she was talking about their papa and how he had to take the job in los angeles because it paid good and the family needs the money
18337,7,0,rose makes the best out of the situation and the detail is the her aunt was born in cambodia and rose was not so aunna had a hard time adjusting to the new scenery when she got here
18338,7,2,rose is a caring girl who wishes to not hurt her aunt's feelings in the conversation they had at the end of the story rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed by helping the family rose didn't answer the question because she felt she would hurt her aunts feelings
18339,7,2,rose is helpful and you can tell this from the conversation she had with anna this is shown when rose tells anna that 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college ' rose is younger and shouldn't have to take on a responsibility like that but she does to help out her family she knows she can't have everything but still she is willing to help out her family as much as possible
18340,7,1,rose gets ery stressed out from being busy and from all the work she has too do in the story it stated that she was very close to getting fired from her job it also talked about how she wouldnt have time to find that she can use to squeeze in her essay
18341,7,0,she holds her feelings inside her and doesn't usually let them out she eventually lets them out when she is talking to aunt kolab
18342,7,0,strong she doesn't complain but she is willing to accept help when anna gets made at her papa rose stands up for him even though shes tired and wants him to come home
18343,7,0,rose is very perceptive to the people around her and that she sacrifices her own feelings to make the other person feel better
18344,7,1,rose is a hard working girl who is more then willing to help her family with any problems she takes time from writing her essey every night to help her aunt kolab prepare dinner
18345,7,1,one important trait that can describe rose would be responsiblity she knows that she has duties to attend and she is only in high school rose does what she needs to do then helps her aunt and holds a job all at the same time that is very responsible to me also knowing she has a paper to do but not enough time to do this paper rose does it anyways
18346,7,1,one trait is hard working i believe she is hard working because most days she goes to school then she goes to work a four hour shift then she goes straight home to help make supper and then she does her homework
18347,7,1,she cares about what she says to her aunt in cambodia what they were doing would be quite normal

18350,7,0,rose trys to act that every thing is ok when around her sister to make sure her sister dosent worry for example when rose realized she was over worked and had to finish her essay and anna walked in and saw the look she had on her face and asked if everything was fine and she replied that she just had a bad dream
18351,7,2,rose can be descirbed as hopeful she believes in her brother's abilities and she also is hopeful that her papa did what was best for them even if the situation upsets her
18352,7,0,i think rose is sincere to what she does but when she has to work or has to do an 3000 word essay she gets overwhelmed and doesn't know what to do
18353,7,0,one trait that describes rose based off some of her conversations would be that she misses her father alot a detail from the story that would help support this is when she is talking to anna and she says' i'm so lonesome for papa it seems like he's been gone for years '
18354,7,1,when she has something in her head she's going to do it she cares a lot about everything in her life
18355,7,2,rose seems very caring and compassionate toward others when she is talking with anna she says 'it's only been four months he had to go ' she says this to try to comfort her sister who is upset about papa leaving
18356,7,1,she is hard working and doesn't give up on anything easily she is going to work after school and then is going home to help with the dinner
18357,7,0,when she was talking to anna she seemed to be at a stump in her life and that trait that she doesn't have is confidence confidence that she knows she can get through it and make things better for herself i think she is very busy with her life and doesn't have time for herself or atleast doesn't make time for herself it seems like she is missing some things in her life that she needs at that point in time 'i'm so lonesome for papa it seems like he's been gone for years' paragraph 9
18358,7,0,that anna is trying to put stuff in her schedule so she can get them done but most the problems she is having is that she can't half of them done so through out this whole story anna is trying to found a way to do this
18359,7,0,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab would be troubled you know this because she feels weighed down i know this because she agrees but doestnt tell aunt kolab about being weighed down
18360,7,0,rose seems very overwhelmed when she is talking to her sister she gets very aggravated and storms out of the kitchen
18361,7,0,rose is very loving because she works hard to try to help her brother get into a good college and would do anything for him even if it ends up hurting herself
18362,7,0,rose is fearful of letting her family down aunt kolab saying 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' shows how much rose is afraid
18363,7,0,one trait that could describe rose is that she has alot of flashbacks and emotional problems another that could also describe her is determinded because she wants to get this done and she stayes up all night trying to write this three hundred word essay that she will say and she fell asleep writting it so i find that she is very determind about the situation and the essay that she must write
18364,7,0,rose is overwhelmed because she feels like she has to do everything rose has to work at the restaurant for a four hour shift then help her aunt prepare a quick supper afterwards she has write her three thousand word essay
18365,7,0,rose is a strong person when anna says she is lonesome for papa rose says it's only been four months and he had to take that job in los angeles
18366,7,0,one trait that can desribe rose is that is is difficult because rose grew up here like when she said this must be difficult for you yes'
18367,7,2,rose is very hard working and caring she believes that when you help someone they will help you in return when rose is having a conversation with her sister anna rose states 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' rose is trying her hardest to pay for all of the expenses that her family has she is a very dedicated lady who seems to find success in a lot of different situations throughout her life
18368,7,0,rose is very stressed out from haveing to do so much it says 'from school she'd gone straight to work for four hours then home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper and then do a three thousand word essay '
18369,7,0,rose has taken on a adultlike responsibility this is evident when anna says to her 'you sound just like mama ' this trait could be described as she was growing up too fast she was not the typical teen that people would think of in the world the best example of this is in the second paragraph where it talks about what her daily routine is like this shows that she is busy with helping this fact is shown when she talks to her aunt in the end when it talks about her being weighed down because she is helping her family
18370,7,1,rose wants to help her family out because of the hard time they are going through she is what you call it a 'people pleaser' and she wants to help out and win the essay contest to help out her family
18371,7,2,rose is considerate she is stressed out and feels like there is too much responsibility on her but knows the family needs help when aunt kolab asks her if she felt weighted down by helping the family she doesn't respond because she wants to help she just doesnt know how much she can
18372,7,1,rose is a very hard working person she has many tasks to do in one day including school help around the hose supper work at the restaurant homework and her essay
18373,7,0,rose feels overwhelmed with all of her responsibilites however she is very understanding about what she needs to do to help her family she displays this understanding attribute when she cups her hands and thinks to herself that her brother's fate lies partly in her hands
18374,7,0,resourceful suddenly it occurred to her here was the topic for her essay although it was still vague
18375,7,1,i believe that rose has traits like a mother would have when she is talking to her sister anna rose takes care of her rose makes sure she is feeling ok and puts her to bed when rose is talking to aunt kolab it shows that she is under a lot of pressure because she has to be the mother figure for anna since their true mother is always out working
18376,7,2,rose is a caring person because as soon as she saw her sister walking into the kitchen in the middle of the night she immediately asked if anything was alright
18377,7,0,guilty would describe rose because in paragraph 19 rose was afraid to tell aunt kolab because the dosen't want to hurt her aunt and she also thought that her aunt would tell her mother so rose just kept it to herself
18378,7,1,rose is a hard worker we do not know how old she is but by the description i would say she's in her teens though at a young age she works a four hour shift then has to go home and help her aunt make supper and this is all before she has time to do her schoolwork
18379,7,0,rose wants to please everybody when she's talking to anna she talks about how they have to do their job to help their brother paul finish college so he can get a good job
18380,7,0,she feels like a burden ' rose kept nodding maybe her life would get easier maybe it wouldn't'
18381,7,1,rose sounds very responsible she has a lot of responsibilities and she is still concerned about school work and other important things in her life
18382,7,0,rose can be described as overwhelmed she is noted quite a few times through out the story as being overly busy
18383,7,0,she belives that money is everything she feels that she and everyone else has to pay for her brother than he will get a job and have to pay for his two siters to go to school
18384,7,1,rose is very hardworking this is demonstrated by the fact that she works a job in addition to her schoolwork and also competes in other areas like the essay writing contest teh fact that she can manage all of those activities at all even if they do leave her exhausted is proof of her hardworking character
18385,7,0,there is one trait that can be picked up from the two conversations in the story rose wants to help her mom and her aunt but she has alot on her mind for instance when she was talking about writting the essay and she said'when woud she have time to write a flawless three thousand word essay '
18386,7,0,she is willing to heklp her brother work his way to college she tries her best to do what she can
18387,7,0,the anna told rose head jerked up from her chest anna what wrong you feel okay that what anna told rose
18388,7,0,rose is angry she has to work and school work at the same time and she just can't take it much longer
18389,7,0,anna knows that no matter how stressful everything is on her she needs to continue to reassure her sister and let her know that everything will be ok when anna asks about their father rose says 'it's only been four months he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here '
18390,7,0,confused i think she wonders why her father would choose to go so far away just for a job and she wonders why her aunt is doing what she's doing to help their family
18391,7,0,i do not know
18392,7,0,rose seems to not talk a lot she just nods when her aunt tells her something
18393,7,1,rose is a very busy person it said that her aunt' offer had somehow made her feel lighter it made the weight on her shoulders lighten up a bit
18394,7,1,one way to describe rose would be respectful because through out the whole story rose never talks back to aunt kolab
18395,7,0,one trait i can think of would be unsure of herself she seems to be unsure if she can help out her family like the others like she questions whether or not she is capable she feels as though she would be a let down if she was not able to help out one detail would be when her aunt ask her ' do you feel so weighed down by waht you're doing to help this family ' she was unable to answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt
18396,7,0,i think that rose is open minded because she could be like her sister and be bitter and angery but even when she talks to her aunt and sister she still concidered about her family because her sister at the table is telling her there's no hope for their family
18397,7,0,with rose having school work chores and homework i would say that she is strong rose has a converstation with anna talikng about their papa and even though rose doesnt like the situation any better she trys to stay positive
18398,7,0,in 'crossing over' the author displays rose as a helpful child but one who keeps her feelings inside although she feels pressured by what she needs to accomplish she does not complain to others or stop doing what needs to be done for example as she was speaking to her sister she explained how they needed to 'help paul finish college and he'll pay for her and anna to go to college' paragraph 11 sentence 3 4 not once does rose express her worry about the situation
18399,7,1,as is widely known people do not always show their true emotions for a multitude of resons even though her feelings told her otherwise during her conversation with anna rose still gave her sister a rational explanation concerning their family's situation rather than be thoroughly honest then when speaking to her aunt rose felt an apprehension about expressing her true feelings because she believed that perhaps she was being weighed down by her family obligations and that to admit it would hurt her family what rose has done being able to set aside her emotions for a greater purpose however difficult it is has shown that perseverence is a key part of her character
18400,7,0,muted noises aunt kolab making muted noises in the kitchen
18401,7,0,lonely 'mama's not home yet is she i hate how late she has to work '
18402,7,0,one trait that can describe rose is that she is jelous of paul an example is when she says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a ggod job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
18403,7,0,rose doesn't want to tell her aunt how she really feels at first because she doesn't want to hurt her or have her aunt tell her mother so one trait would ne that she is mature she takes care of her little sister while her mother works long nights
18404,7,2,aunt kolab cares about anna and she knows when something is wrong with her 'anna ' rose said 'what's wrong you feel okay '
18405,7,0,from reading this story i have come to find that rose is a self centered person when young anna came into the kitchen and told rose that she had had a nightmare rose quickly changed the subject to herself by saying 'i fell asleep working on an essay ' without giving a second thought to how her sister might be feeling
18406,7,0,the trait is that rose kept an 'open mind' during the talks and ultimately found a topic for her essay which pretty much worked out in the long run
18407,7,0,in both conversations they talk about being flustrated and weighed down with stress rosa feels she almost can't go on because of the fact her fathers gone and she's left to work rosa feels ' that she is too young for so much responsibility '
18408,7,2,rose can be optimistic'rose kept nodding maybe her life would get easier maybe it wouldnt '
18409,7,2,'anna ' rose said 'whats wrong ' you feel okay ' it shows that she is caring
18410,7,1,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab could be that she is a very family person she wishes to make people happy and try her best to keep the family togather
18411,7,2,rose is a kind person and she seems to always be thinking about someone else in her conversation with her little sister anna rose feels overwelmed but she doesn't let her sister know and she even tries to compfort her when anna complains about their mother not being home and their father being away rose explains to her little sister why things are how they are in a gentle way this shows compation and caring
18412,7,0,rose was cautious she didn't want to make a mistake that could result in someone being mad at her one passage in the story that would support this conclusion is 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother '
18413,7,2,one trait rose shows is caring the reader can see this in the 19th paragraph because rose doesn't want to tell her aunt kolab what she really feels for fear of hurting her feelings
18414,7,0,rose says anna 'sounds just like mama' she trys to make things work with what they have
18415,7,0,i think that rose should've taken this a little bit more calmer because the rest of them moved on and so did she
18416,7,0,rose is a very busy young women
18417,7,2,rose is very diligent in the story she is talking to her sister when she tells her that she fell asleep while working on her essay that shows that she was working hard enough to make her tired
18418,7,0,rose is a very closed person she doesn't say much until she really has to or is somewhat forced to
18419,7,0,rose is very open sighted she see's things through her eyes and through the eyes of others one support for this is when she is talking to aunt kolab and her aunt says 'but now i realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes as you should i suppose because you grew up here this must be difficut for you yes ' this quote shows how rose's aunt didn't see through other eyes and had to have rose point it out to her the eyes maybe of a different person or a different culture but she was seeing differently
18420,7,2,rose can be described as consoling in her conversation with anna rose attempts to make sense of the family's load to anna who is distraught and doesn't quite understand the whole situation she justifies their helping paul with college by telling her how he'll be able to pay for them to go to college once he has a job rose also tries to make a quick joke about money to lighten the mood
18421,7,1,rose cares because in thestory of crossing over she trys to help with the money but the three thounds word essay was messing with her
18422,7,1,that she is always worried
18423,7,2,one trait is caring it can be seen when rose was asks her sister anna whats wrong this shows she cares about whats upsetting her sister
18424,7,2,rose while feeling overwhelmed tried to be optimistic in most situations she feels like she has to be a role model for anna if rose expresses her true feelings then she is afraid that anna will lose faith in their situation as well in paragraph 11 rose explains with a maternal tone how her and anna have to appreciate what paul is doing for them he is going to school so he can get a job and ultimately help pay for the sisters' college funds rose tries to point out the importance in helping out paul rose would much rather talk about how she wants to give up how she is tired of working so much and how school is constantly weighing down on her despite these feelings rose tries to remain positive for anna's sake and holds her tongue
18425,7,0,rosa coul be feeling a little hust at the dream she had she told anna that 'i'm fine i just had another bad dream '
18426,7,0,in this story the character of rose is in a tough situation her family is struggling to make money and this puts alot of pressure on her as a result when she is talking to her sister anna you see you get a little angry this is a result of the high amount of pressure that she is feeling you can see this when she resonds to anna saying 'money isn't everthing' with 'only if you already have everthing ' this is a rude resonse and is a result of the pressure rose is feeling to not only finish her essay but to also make money for her family
18427,7,0,rose is a very smart person who thinks of things differently than others this is shown in paragraphs 10 and 11 when anna says that money isn't everything and rose says only if you already have everything most people wouldn't think of the situation in that way
18428,7,2,one trait that describes rose is understanding when anna says that 'it seems like he's papa been gone for years' rose understands it is for their good because ' the job in los angeles paid three times what he is making here '
18429,7,0,rose is trying to be a rock for the family she has to keep her head up for her little sister and paul it shows when she tries to console her sister by saying 'he had to go ' when she says this she is using an excuse to make her sister feel better
18430,7,0,rose is a thinker she analyzes everything and will search for the meaning inside herself
18431,7,1,rose is a very caring and respectful person she does many things to help around the house she does these chores before even doing her homework she dreams that paul jumps from a cliff and is weighing her down under the water paul in her dream refers to her caring and missing him since he has been gone for four months and him weighing her down refers to all the responsibility that she has at home
18432,7,0,that her mother is always late when getting home from work
18433,7,1,one trait that rose has is the feeling of responsibility she shows that when she is looking at her hands and says 'paul's fate lies partly in these'
18434,7,0,rose is timid she shows this in both conversations were she either kept quiet or she didn't speak out very much at all
18435,7,0,one trait that describes rose based on her conversation with anna is that she is fearful because of the essay and helping her brother a detail from the story is 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay fro you and me to go to college '
18436,7,0,rose is very rational she shows this trait in her conversation with anna she tells anna the reasoning behind her father's job and she knows that they just need to do their part to get to a better life

18438,7,0,she wants to find something better for her aunt and whole family not just one person rose is not a selfish person which makes her trait outgoing
18439,7,0,from paragraph 19 i could tell that rose is a very modest person i got the feeling that she doesn't like to bother people she even says 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt ' therefore she clearly does not want to burden anyone
18440,7,2,one trait that can describe rose is that she is outgoin and is a hard worker even if she is trying to help out a nother family member 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
18441,7,0,rose is always busy and doesnt feel like she should be doing all that she does at her age the conversation with aunt kolab she trys to come up with ideas to help rose with everything she does
18442,7,0,feeling the family is on her shoulders as if she is the one holding everybody together paul's body sank down on top of rose pushing her to the sandy bottom she was unable to breath because of the pressure she gets from her entire family
18443,7,0,she is very self sufficient while conversing with aunt kolab she was very weary about letting her true feeling show aunt kolab thought up the meaning of rose's dream and asked if rose felt that way of course rose not wanting any help or pity avoided expressing her true emotions

18445,7,1,one trait that rose has is responsibility she takes care of all her problems and situations in the story after school everyday she goes straight to work then home to help aunt kolab prepare dinner
18446,7,2,one trait that describes rose based on her conversations with her family is that she is determined she is exhausted and overwhlemed with all this stuff she is suppose to do but yet is still determined to make it through because she knows she has to do this for her brother even though it isn't easy for her she knows that in the end it will all pay off paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college one detail from the story to support this is that rose says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'
18447,7,2,rose is hopeful because during her conversation with anna she would say how when paul gets a good job after college he would pay for her and anna to go to college too
18448,7,2,rose seems very caring and always think about others she is so worried about helping her brother go to college
18449,7,1,rose is a young girl having to squeeze in time for her school work while she has a job and also a younger sibling to take care of even though she had many things to do she still is caring for her family and is willing to do it all for them

18451,7,2,one trait of rose's that was shown in her coversation with aunt kolab hit me like a speeding bullet respect rose has respect for her aunt and her family she knew the answer to aunt kolab's question but felt that she would hurt her aunt so she decided it was better to say nothing than something wrong
18452,7,0,she was afaird she was afaird to tell her aunt the truth
18453,7,0,rose is brave in the sense that she doesn't want her sister to know how she really feels rose tries to be strong when she is talking to her sister and laughed a fake laugh she didn't want her sister to worry about her so rose was brave
18454,7,1,one trait that discribes rose is loyalty even with her hectic schedule rose is loyal to her family s needs rose finishes homework late at night so that she can squeeze in work at the restaurant rose feels the weight of a busy schedule but the extra restaurant work provides her family with some money that they sincerely need
18455,7,0,rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her
18456,7,1,through her conversations with anna and aunt kolab one trait that shows in rose is loyalness even though rose is weighed down by her school life working and trying to help out the family she does all she can to try and get through a tough situation
18457,7,0,even if i win i won't get to travel to sacramento to recieve the prize
18458,7,0,anna is a very realistic person and that is a good trait to have she could easily be mad at her father for leaving her but she realizes that their family needs the money so she accepts why he left anna can see that her father is not leaving to get away but that he is leaving to help his family have a better life she demonstraits this trait when she is talking to rose and anna says 'only if you already have everything ' when talking about how important money is anna is realistic about how important money really is

18464,7,0,rose did not want to hurt her family by telling her aunt that she felt weighed down by helping them so much she did not answer her aunt's question because she knew that the truth would hurt her aunt and her mother
18465,7,1,i believe that one trait about rose is how dedicated she is to helping her family in the story she mentions that she goes straight to school then to work home to cook dinner with her aunt then does homework for the rest of the night so this obviously shows she is doing everything in her power to help her family make it
18466,7,0,one trait that i saw was that she acts different around different family members for example she was talking a bit more with her sister than she did with her aunt
18467,7,0,rose seems like she would be dramatic as certain times she said 'i'm so lonesome for papa it seems like he's been gone for years ' when in reality he was gone for four months which is found in paragraph 9 sentence 1
18468,7,0,she is a very busy and stressed out girl an example to show is when she is trying to figure out how to fit in a 3 000 word essay and work a 4 hour shift at the resturaunt
18469,7,0,well it was that time in the kitchen that can desribe rose how she stood and stalked out of the kitchen
18470,7,1,i think that rose is mature i think this because in the story she tries to help her sister with how she is feeling rose tries to help anna out with the leaving of their father
18471,7,1,based on the conversation between rose and anna i believe that rose is protective in paragraph 11 rose 'tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her ' it seems like rose is trying to comfort anna without revealing what she truly feels by covering up her feelings while speaking to anna i believe rose is being protective and trying not to expose anna to the way she really feels about her papa's absence
18472,7,1,rose is an independent person she can do things for herself she seems to like to appear tough to her family like she has everything together and she can get along just fine it seems that rose does not want her family to know of her concerns for the trip she would to take or of her concerns for her brother and the rest of the family rose is also caring deep down and cares so much the weight of her caring weighs her down when anna spoke to rose about their brother paul anna seems guarded she doesn't want to show her sister how she really feels about the conversation and her family's situation with her father and her brother anna tells rose that she sounds just like their mother because she talks of how they really needed the money for which their father was working
18473,7,0,rose is very shy but also likes to get what she wants she likes things to be her way in the story aunt kolab says 'hmm maybe we can find a way to do things differently a way better for you '

18581,7,2,this story shows that rose is a mentally strong girl the story shows this trait in her when rose says to anna 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college ' this sentence shows that rose is a mentally strong because eventhough she is younger that paul she still has to help him finish college rose also has school work and family obligations that she has to take care of too
18582,7,2,i think that rose is very caring and even though she is struggling herself she worries about other people i think this because when she was talking to anna in the kitchen she says 'anna what's wrong do you feel okay ' i think that really shows how much she cares for her sister even though she's worried about her essay she takes the time to make sure her sisters okay
18583,7,1,i think rose is very hardworking cause she says 'we have our part to do do help paul finish for college ' i think it shows that rose works hard even if she doesn't enjoy doing the work
18584,7,2,one trait that i think describes rose is mature i think this because when she was talking to her sister anna she stood up for her father who moved to los angeles she looks at things from other peoples' perspectives which makes her very mature
18585,7,0,mad
18586,7,0,rose is very tired and overworked from school she'd gne straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework
18587,7,2,1 i belive that rose is an extremely comforting person because of the conversation that she had with anna she comforted anna about her bad dream by talking with her and by making her a glass of orange juice
18588,7,0,she was talking to anna and said he had to go los angeles paid three times what he was making here 'anna glared at rose 'money isn't everything 'that she was under stress and her mother was working late
18589,7,0,rose is very close minded she's so used to things in america that she didn't realize that what she's doing to help her family was also done in cambodia her family's native country her aunt tells her 'in cambodia our first country what we're all doing would be quite normal but now i realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes as you should i suppose because you grew up here this must be difficult for you yes ' to show that rose is indeed weighted by her efforts to help her brother paul graduate from college and also to help her family in other ways as well such as helping her aunt kolab with making supper and helping anna cope with bad dreams
18590,7,0,that rose knows wgat is going on with her family
18591,7,2,rose wants to help the family as much as possible but she does not want to up set her mother or aunt in paragragh 19 she says if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
18592,7,0,she is a person who thinks bout every thing even if it is a old thought like ther dream she had how she remembered him jumpin off the rock and sank like a rock and had her pinned to the ground and didnt even realize it
18593,7,0,hard headed but open minded at the same time
18594,7,0,rose is a person who tries to please everyone this trait is clearly shown when she does not answer her aunt when she asks rose about feeling weighed down
18595,7,0,while talking to anna rose shows that she has a short temper when she rolls her eyes and then 'she stood and stalked out of the kitchen
18596,7,0,when she is quiet she seems self concious
18597,7,0,rose come's off to be a an impatient person its not her sister's fault that she has to write such a long essay she gets an attitude with her sister 'her voice sank to a fierce whisper '
18598,7,0,one trait is the fact that she doesn't want to hurt her family no matter the reason so she decides to lie in paragraph 19 she puts this theory into effect
18599,7,2,rose can be described by the the word caring she shows this in her conversations with both her aunt and anna when she talks to both of them in the words she say she really seems to care for example she says 'whats wrong you feel okay '
18600,7,0,rose is very turthful sometimes also she keeps almost everything in how she was turthful she told her aunt about her dream also she kept in about how she felt about the work load
18601,7,2,rose is caring and doesn't like to upset others when she was talking to her aunt it said 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother ' which shows that she doesn't want to see her aunt get hurt
18602,7,0,i believe that rose had the trait to endure not only does she endure her long hard days and make time to write her state qualifying essay she also has the patients to endure even the negative moments that her sister often feels due to the situation they are in
18603,7,0,rose doesn't think that her life will never get alittle easier unless her parents and her aunt had someway to make her feel lighter then always being busy 'camdodian tradition and snese of family she realized could survive an ocean corssing''
18604,7,1,she is a very caring person and she always wants to help out she always try's to be nice
18605,7,1,rose seems like she does alot to help her family and it is hard on her because shes still young she's a strong person and would most likely do everything she could to help her family rose probably felt aot better after talking to her aunt and now she feels like things might get easier
18606,7,1,rose the main character of this passage seems to be very grounded and down to earth while many people may deem these as pessimistic characteristics some value these as they are able to bear the hardcomings of reality when it comes time an example of rose's groundedness is during her conversation with her little sister instead of comforting anna when she talked about missing thier father rose simply told her that it was neccessary for him to leave in order for them to send thier older brother to college
18607,7,0,rose is open minded the support is when aunt kolab was making suggestions like sew for ladies or even make special treats from their country and sell them rose was agreeable when she was nodding her head
18608,7,2,one trait rose has is that she can make the best out of anything although she feels so weighed down by working to help out her brother her aunt helps to brighten her day saying that maybe she could help rose out not only did this make rose feel better but she also used it as inspiration for her essay and realized that her life really wasn't all that bad
18609,7,0,rose is not very happy that her father had to go away for his job when she wakes for her bad dream she goes to talk to anna about how she feels she says that she misses him and says money isn't everything because that's why he went to get more money for the family rose doesn't understand that so she is very upset about him leaving
18610,7,2,rose is a very caring person she would not tell her aunt kolab that she felt weighed down by her family because she did not want to hurt her aunt
18611,7,0,i think that rose feels like she has alot of weight on her shoulders and kind of does not know what to do like in the story her aunt said 'this must be difficult for you yes ' rose nodded that rite there is what tells me that rose feels responsible
18612,7,0,she feels stressed like she can't do what she wants to do she feels as though she must do what is best for the family therefore hiding the feelings that consume her chest an example of this would be when she was talking about winning the prize for the eassy but having to travel to sacramento she said that she couldn't go because she'd missed too many shifts and she needed her job
18613,7,0,one trait that describes rose is tired exhausted ' i feel asleep working on my essay' rose said
18614,7,0,anna feels sorry for her dad cause her mom works way to much
18615,7,0,its like she wants to keep her true feelings inside and have her two family members thinking everything is okay detail from story rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
18616,7,1,to me it sounds like rose helps provide for her family which tells that she is responsible when she is talking to her aunt kolab her aunt asks 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' that tells me she helps her sister and brings in money from her job she spends so much time on and doesnt have time for herself such as the essay
18617,7,0,she worries too much about her future instead of what is happening to her right now she talked to anna about they had a part to do so that they could go to college aunt kolab also asked her if she felt weighed down by what she had to do rose said that she does worry about it
18618,7,0,she is lonely and dont like having her parents not around because how she said 'i hate how late she has to work' and also when she said im so lonesome for papa'
18619,7,0,one trait that can describe rosa based on her converstions with aunt kolab is exausted because she has alot on her shoulders between working school and other activities such as the three thousand word essay for a competition
18620,7,0,rose has identified her self as stressed durring both conversations rose seems to be hiding it when rose's aunt began speaking she noticed rose's face 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family '
18621,7,1,based on the conversation rose had with anna i would say that rose is this very sincere person who is just some what lost the reason i say this is because when she is having this talk with anna she talks about how things are going to be ok for them when its timne for them to go to college because paul is going to help them just as her and anna are doing for him but she doesnt really know if thats really true
18622,7,1,rose is a loving caring and very family orientated
18623,7,1,she is a hard worker she always helps her aunt and mom out she also makes sure her homework is done and wants to do an essay
18624,7,0,that their father left to make more money
18625,7,2,in the story crossing over the character rose is very hard working when rose is talking to her younger sister anna she says that she fell asleep working on her essay another thing rose says while talking to her sister is that we have to do our part to help paul the older brother finish college later in the story she is talking to her aunt and her aunt says to her do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family these example show that rose is a very hard worker
18626,7,2,she shows compasion whe she was talking to her aunt kolab she knew she would hurt her feelins if she told the truth about her question so she did not say anything
18627,7,0,she feels like she isn't ready to have someone else's fate in her hands when she talked to aunt kolab she didn't talk but she did agree that she felt weighted down by all the responsobility and soon after was grateful that she had talked about it
18628,7,1,rose worries alot
18629,7,0,i brlieve that rose is sad she is moping around she is having nightmares she feels like the wolrd is resting on her shoulders
18630,7,1,i believe strength describes rose she is trying to hold her family together and we see this during her conversation with anna
18631,7,0,rose is strong even though she has to work at the restaurant and go to school she tries to push forward for her family
18632,7,0,from reading the passage one of rose's traits would probably be confusion or exhaustion from the essay
18633,7,0,rose is very stressed girl she has so much to do in so little time she has to do that paper and also put someone through school then have time to go to school herself
18634,7,0,rose is lonely she says 'i'm so lonesome for papa it seems like he's been gone for years '
18635,7,2,rose is a helpful kind loving sister this trait of love can be seen when rose says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college' this statement shows the maturity of rose that she is willing to sacrafice in order to help her brother by keeping her brother in school rose knows that he will someday help her through school which also shows that her priorities in life are set right and she wants to learn another example of this trait of maturity apears again when the author states that she goes from school to work and then stays up late into the night
18636,7,2,rose is caring because she is a person that would do anything to help her family when anna discusses her distaste for their mother working so late and their father not being around rose attempts to lighten the situation and make anna feel better she makes a joke saying that money isn't everything as long as you already have everything rose also tries to explain why everything has to happen the way it does an example of this is when she tells anna that the only reason he left them was to make money for them to better their future
18637,7,1,she's caring by listening to her sister and trying to cheer her up even though she failed at it and also thinks about her aunt and her home country of cambodia as something to write for her essay
18638,7,0,sincere 'rose didn't answer ' 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother '

18640,7,0,rose is a quite girl it saids that rose didn't answer or she just nodded
18641,7,0,when rose talks to her sister they do not get along and they argue about there family and money rose can't get anna to understand that the family needs money and there dad moved away to make more money when rose talks to her aunt she feels the same way as rose does they both understand that the family needs money her aunt says that it was the same way in the other country they both have the same trait just different arguments
18642,7,0,rose is very humble at first rose dislikes all the responsibility that is put on her then she realizes that paul has the fate of two people in his hands rose only has to take care of herself for now she appreciates the fact that paul will care for her and her sister
18643,7,0,she has a way with finding topics for her essays suddeenly it all occured to her here was the topic for her essay although it was still vague
18644,7,2,caring she cares because she didn't want to answer her aunt truthfully whenever she knew that it would hurt her aunt's feelings
18645,7,1,rose seems very caring when her sister anna wakes up and she is talking to rose about how their dad had to go to los angeles for a job and rose comforted anna even though she was upset as well
18646,7,1,rose cares about her family more than anything
18647,7,0,one trait that could easily describe rose would be that she is stressed and somewhat anxious about everything she is doing at the moment and what more she would have to do if her brother wasn't there i think she feels like she has a lot of weight put on her because of all the other things her family members are doing her mom works late and so that must mean that rose has to watch over her sister a lot which puts kind of a lot of stress on her because she also has to worry about other things going on in her life at the same time
18648,7,0,rose is a lonely person
18649,7,2,rose cares for her family not wanting to answer her aunt so she would not hurt her aunt she also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away
18650,7,0,rose feels as if she has to work work work to help her family it seems she can't enjoy herself or write her essay in the story it says 'pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom' rose feels trapped beneath the weight of what is expected of her
18651,7,0,one trait that can describe rose is her driving need to succeed and help her family in any way she can the fact that she is trying so hard to help her aunt and wanting to keep her little sisters spirits up
18652,7,0,one trait of rose based on her conversations with aunt kolab is that she is tired of being so busy and would like some time to live rose said that she feels too young for so much responsibility she told aunt kolab and she understood seeing that she would see what she could do to take some stress off of rose s shoulders
18653,7,0,she wasn't really in to the conversation she just kept nodding her head to show that she understood what her aunt was trying to say
18654,7,2,she is optimistic she tells anna that when paul finnishes college he will help pay for her and her sister to go to college
18655,7,1,rose is exhausted and hard working but also quit aunt kolab asked her if she felt weighted down even though she does she didn't admit that she did
18656,7,1,one trait that describes rose is hopeful even though she has to work go to school cook and try to write an essay she still has hope that her life is going to get better this is shown when rose is talking to her aunt kolab 'maybe i can sew for ladies or i could make special treats from our country and sell them ' this sentence shows how she is going to make an effort to make her life better she is also hopeful by coming up with an essay topic to write about and maybe should could win the writing contest
18657,7,0,rose could be described as lazy because she doesn't want to work
18658,7,0,rose knows she has to get the essay done and ann i will ing to help
18659,7,0,she is easily stressed out to the point where thinking clearlly is near impossible the dream that she had was symbolic because paul weighed her down just like stress weighed her thoughts also paul has recieved his diploma and so she may feel pressured to reach up at education just as he did but the essay unresolved burdens her mind
18660,7,0,rose is very difiant in the story it's almost like she is looking for attention rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream to expose i5t so it would loosen the grip on her after she had finished her aunt said with a puzzled look 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family '
18661,7,2,rose is a very understanding person she understands that in order to live a life somewhere new there will be changes that they all will have to make she knows that they cannot all have everything they want but in order to have somethings they have to make some sacrifices while rose is talking with anna she explains to her that their father getting a job in los angeles was something he had to do for their family although none of them like the fact their father is away so much it is something they all have to learn to accept in order to have the life they want
18662,7,1,rose is a very responsible person because she tries to do all that she can to help out her family she tries to suppress how she is really feeling inside in order to avoid conflict
18663,7,0,rose can be described as an unopen person for example in the story she doesnt explain or tell anyone the way she feels about the situation with her family and when she finally told her aunt about how she felt did everything change
18664,7,2,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab is that she is a grateful person when aunt kolab offered to sew for ladies or make special treats from their country to sell rose felt better in crossing over it says 'but her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter ' that signifies that rose truely did appriciate what aunt kolab was willing to do to help her out
18665,7,0,rose is responsibility because she said 'she felt too young for so much respnsibilt'
18666,7,2,one of rose's main traits in the story is her selfless determination when she says 'we have our part to do to help paul pay for college ' she shows how helpful she is to her brother
18667,7,1,she is hardworking because she balances schoolwork and works a 4 hour shift at her job
18668,7,0,rose is shy rose shows this when she is talking to anna rose does not say much but finally looses patience with anna also when rose talks to aunt kolab she does not say much either just keeping her thoughts to herself and nodding
18669,7,2,one trait to describe rose would be optimistic after anna's bad dream rose tries to help anna see their father moving away as a positive thing rose also attempts to help anna look forward to the future when their older brother finishes college and gets a good job
18670,7,2,one quality to describe rose based on her conversation with anna would be she is responsible rose said 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college ' she has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister rose feels pressure from her duties to the family but she knows the responsibility means more and comes first
18671,7,1,rose is a very responsible and respectful person in paragraph 2 she was responsible for supporting her family working and doing school work rose is very respectful to her aunt kolab because as it shows in paragraph 12 sshe does not want to hurt her
18672,7,1,based on the conversation with anna you can tell rose is sincere she hid her true feelings in order to try to comfort her little sister
18673,7,0,rose is careless of others in her conversation with anna she was talking as if money were everything and she was rolling her eyes at anna rose said they have to do their part and help paul through college so he will pay for them to go to college when it's their turn to go
18674,7,0,rose is a independent teenaged girl with alot on her plate from school she goes straight to her job at a resturant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help her aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework she feels overlwhemlmed with the family's focus on her brother paul she don't want to wait on him to take care of her and their family she wants to make moves on her own
18675,7,2,rose is a responsible person she knows that she has a role in her family she does everything she needs to do to make her family's plan go smoothly she does things that most girls her age do not have to do because she is responsible for her brother going to college in a way she is responsible for her future if she helps pay for her brother's college now he will help pay for hers when it is time she never complains and is responsible for her role in the family
18676,7,2,in the passage rose says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college ' she says this to her little sister anna as she explains to her the improtance of her parents work to make more money this statement by rose expresses her work ethic it shows that she is hardworking and that it is important to her as well as the rest of her family to work hard to support one another
18677,7,2,i think that rose is catious of other peoples feelings she doesnt want to hurt her aunts feelings by saying yes 'do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose didnt answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
18678,7,0,anna
18679,7,0,rose is selfish in the story when rose and anna were talking rose was saying how there papa was away in las angelas for 4 months but she really didn't care cause the job payed better anna got upset and said money wasn't everything to her
18680,7,0,she feels like everything is hard for her her essay her job moving from a different country it would be hard for her she feels suppressed from pauls achievements because he has graduated from high school and is getting worried because her family doesn't have alot of money for school
18681,7,0,rose
18682,7,0,rosa feels like her brother is bringing her down she also feels like she is responsible for her brother in a way a part in the story is when she says 'paul's fate lies partly in these' she talking about her hands she is saying that she is going to have to work for him so they can have a good life
18683,7,0,rose's trait in independence has been grounded down into nearly nothing she doesn't believe she can make it to college on her own because she believes her brother holds the responsibility for that
18684,7,0,rose is uptight this is apparent when she dreams of paul smashing her and feels weighed down by what she's doing for the family
18685,7,2,thoughtful when aunt kolab asked 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose did not answer because she was being considerate and knew that it would hurt aunt kolab and her mother's feelings if she had answered the question also rose was very gentle about expressing her opinions with anna about her father working so far away
18686,7,1,rose is loving and cares for her familybut she is scared and lonely rose is scared f being lonely and misses her family very much rose expresses her feelings of loneliness
18687,7,0,rose had a essay to write and she was getting a additude with them all rolling her eyes throughing the chair and more she wanted to stay with her aunt kolab and her aunts face lit up because she wanted her niece to stay with her and start over
18688,7,1,rose understands why her father left because she is more mature than anna and realistic about thier situation i know this because when anna says money isn't everything she replies saying that it isn't if you already have everything
18689,7,0,rose is doubtful especially by her sarcastic remarks toward her sister anna saying 'only if you already have everything '
18690,7,0,rose she has a lot on her plate she has to work and go to school plus has to watch her sister anna plus rose seems to be a dreamer she has a lot of bad dreams everything is hard for both her and anna
18691,7,2,rose is very considerate of her family when talking to aunt kolab she shows this because even tho she feels overwhelmed working to take care of her famliy she doesn't not want to say anything that may hurt her aunt
18692,7,2,one trait that describes rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab is that she is extremely conscience of other peoples feelings i think this because when her aunt asked her if she really felt so weighed down rose hesitated a lot before telling her aunt the truth because she didn't want to hurt her
18693,7,0,rose seems to be reserved she's more to herself she won't talk about her feelings to others at the end of the story aunt kolab was asking rose about how she felt about the family she asked 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose didn't answer to her aunt kolab she just simply nodded
18694,7,1,thoughtful because she wanted to hide how weighed down she felt because she didnt want to hurt her mother
18695,7,1,they both like helping people
18696,7,1,rose is very dedicated to what she does she has school homework and a four hour shift and still finds time to write a 3 thousand word essay
18697,7,2,rose puts her family before herself this can be seen when she is talking to anna and insists that they must work hard to put their brother through college
18698,7,0,a trait that rose has is the ability to suppress her problems and to reassure others
18699,7,0,she is very stressed when rose talks to anna about working on the essay so hard that she fell asleep doing it
18700,7,2,in the conversations that rose has with anna and aunt kolab rose comes off as determined she is determined to graduate just like her brother paul did she's determined to help her family out as much as possible with her father gone in los angeles
18701,7,0,she is a very busy person in the story she is constantlydoing something to help wether it be school or family 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to hel aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework ' paragraph 2
18702,7,1,rose knows she wants something else but the sense of family she feels is stronger
18703,7,1,she is caring and wants to be as kind as possible an example was when the story said 'it's only been four months ' rose said as gently as she could ' she was obviously trying to be nice to her sister
18704,7,0,a trait that rose showed when she was talking to anna was that she can be sarcastic she shows that when anna said 'money isn't everything' and rose responded with 'only if you already have everything'
18705,7,2,rose is caring when her aunt asks if she feels weighted down by her responsibility to her family does not tell her that she is she does this to save her aunt's and mother's feeling so they are not dissapointed in her
18706,7,0,rose is upset because her mother is always working she feels that it is her job to watch out for her sister and little brother
18707,7,0,she is stressed out alot and she cant write her essay 'when would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand word essay '
18708,7,1,one trait that rose possesses is that she is very caring for other people she is very stressed concerning her family's situation yet she still manages to keep going her talks with aunt kolab helped show her that she can take her situation and make use of what she has thus she finds a topic for her essay making her feel better
18709,7,0,one trait that describes rose would be stressed in the story she has to work at a resturant help her aunt with supper and do homework the story also tells me that she would have to 'squeeze' in writing a paper telling me that she is pushed for time showing that she is stressed
18710,7,2,determined because she just knows that paul will finish college and make enough money so that both of the girls will also be able to go to college even though anna doesn't think that this will happen rose knows it will happen
18711,7,0,rosa told her aunt kolab about the dream she had and how she felt about it her aunt understood completly and trird to help rose and talk to her about the situation and decided to try little activities to help rose not feel this way
18712,7,1,i would describe anna as a very hard worker she goes to school on a daily basis after school she then works a four hour shift at a restaurant when she gets off work anna rushes home to help her aunt kolab prepare a quick supper and then she does her homework anna has to juggle school work and a demanding home life at a young age which in my eyes makes her a hard worker
18713,7,0,i think rose's most outstanding trait is her sense of sympathy rose seems like a young girl with too much responsibility but instead of going into how hard her life is she notes on how much harder paul's life was this also shows a good deal of selflessness and respect for others
18714,7,0,what is only one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna and aunt kolab the one and only trait that i think could describe rose is motivation i think that this word would describe her the best beacuse she always thinks of other ways to do things in paragraph 22 line 1'hmm maybe we can find a way to do things differntly ' i also think that this shows her character is a very driven person
18715,7,0,one trait rose has in this passage was that she said that ''money isn't everthing'' meaning that no matter how thing turned out they where going to be ok till papa gets back from his job in los angeles
18716,7,1,one of the traits that rose has based on her conversation with her aunt kalob she's someone that would do anything for anyone just to make thinngs right and go better an example of this is that she goes to school and has a job right after school leaving her not enough time to do anything she really wants to do for herself but she wants ans needs to help her family out
18717,7,2,a trait that i believe would describe rose best would be persistant even though she has to work a job help around the house and has the pressure on her to go to college she still goes on with life and does the best she can during her conversation with anna rose tries to cheer her up and help her understand that they are doing better than they would have been doing in cambodia but rose also hides how she really feels and even though she does not like the weight she must carry she still moves on during her conversation with aunt kolab rose also sees the brighter side of things in how her aunt can sell things to help the family out and makes things a little easier for rose
18718,7,2,one trait of rose would be that she is hard working this i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab she has all these thing to do it's like she is carrying around the whole family on her shoulder that everything i sup to her although she is still young she still works as hard as she can to do the best for her family and thats deffeniatly a hard worker
18719,7,0,rose felt that she did a lot for the family she felt too stressed rose did a lot she balanced having a job school helping take care of her sister and family she felt weighed down also an example of this was when rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by all she did for her family rose did not answer her because she didn't want her family to feel bad she thought that her aunt would also tell her mother she didnt want anyone to feel bad or get mad at her for anything even at the end of the story rose's aunt understood where she was coming from and made suggestions to help rose's stress level
18720,7,0,she was sincere one way this is shown in the story is 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt'
18721,7,0,rose has a sense of humor she says 'only if you already have everything ' to express this humor although she does not feel like the happiness behind it is real
18722,7,0,she is very protective of her family she wants to fix everything and make sure everything works out she has a strong sense of duty you can see this by how she goes straight from school to work a long shift to help her aunt make dinner
18723,7,1,rose can be described as selfless she puts the needs of her family first she risks her school work and even a state competition by working to help support her family her aunt kolab hints at it when she asks rose if she feels weighed down by what she has to do for the family but rose doesnt respond
18724,7,1,one trait that i can see in rose is that she is the kind of person who worries about everything like when her and anna were talking about how little time she had to do things because she had to work and that she had missed a lot of shifts and her supervisor was already about to fire her so she wouldn't be able to travel to sacramento if she won the essay prize
18725,7,0,rose can quickly see the better things that can come out of the situations she is living in this shows that rose has a good attitude on life and when she is down she can become happy very quickly
18726,7,1,i think rose is very caring it seems like she is doing everything she can to help her family even though it can be very stressful at times i think she loves her family very much and would never stop helping them just because she is feeling overwhelmed
18727,7,2,she is considerate paragraph 19 rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
18728,7,1,shes a caring person
18729,7,0,rose doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings by saying how she feels she didn't want to hurt her sister or her aunt in the story it says rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
18730,7,2,rose seems like she is a caring and providing member in their family the storys states that she has a job tries hard in school and tries to help her sister as much as she can it seems the father will be gone for a long period of time as will the brother one for work and the other for school so it seems rose may have to step up and help out
18731,7,0,thinks she knows everything she ignores anna
18732,7,0,rose has this trait that seems to show that she keeps her problems to herself to stop her family from worrying about her instead of working to help her brother finish college rose shows this when she stops by her mothers bedroom and finds her mom asleep this shows that rose would have told her about the dream had her mother been awake but her mother was not awake to help so rose continued to keep to herself
18733,7,2,rose cares very deeply about others she tries to comfort others and would do anything for them in her conversation with anna rose sees that her younger sister is upset rose tries to comfort anna and tells her that even though things are tough now they will get better
18734,7,1,she is hard working ' from school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it waws time to do homework '
18735,7,2,rose is dedicated to her family this is proven by her conversation with anna when she says that she and her father have to work for paul to go through school also rose's dream reflects that she feels the burden of this dedication when she describes that she thinks she is drowning all of this evidence supports the idea that rose is dedicated to helping out her family even though sometimes it can be difficult
18736,7,1,one trait that rose has that stands out his her love for her family she is angered by the thought of her dad being gone for four months just to earn more money this is evident when she says 'money isn't everything ' she knows that her dad is trying to get the best for his children but she would rather have him around she understands that family is more important than having more money to spend
18737,7,2,rose displays an outward optimism in her conversation with her younger sister anna she really understands anna's resentment and frustration as her dream reveals but she replies to anna with answers that predict a bright future for her and anna saying 'then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to colloge '
18738,7,1,one trait that describes rose based on her conversation with anna or aunt kolab is that she is understanding she is willing to listen to others' advice such as the advice she got from her aunt kolab she is also willing to give advice such as the advice she gave to her sister anna she is not hard headed she is willing to take others' advice and look at the situation from their point of view
18739,7,0,rose thought she is to young to have all the responsability that she has to take care of and is streed by it all and she still has to wright aflawless three thousand wors essay
18740,7,0,one trait of rose is that she hides her feelings after she has that dream when she is tlaking to aunt kolab 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family 'rose doesn't answer and aunt kolab knows the answer is yes because she goes to 'school works comes home to help the family out and then does her homework '
18741,7,0,rose is a strong person she wants to be a rock for her sister she tries to do her best to keep the family going when anna is complaining about her father rose soothes her being as gentle as possible even though rose has a lot going on she does her best to act as a leader for the rest of the family
18742,7,0,rose hides her emotions for the sake of others she shows how selfless she is when she does not answer her aunt's question in paragraph 19 sentence 1
18743,7,1,rose seems to be very responsible she had a job to be on time for school work to get done and she had to help her aunt kolab with house chores
18744,7,1,rose is very helpfull which is a lovely trait to have she offers ideas to her aunt to make things better like sewing or making treats
18745,7,0,happy cause she trys to cheer her sister up depending on her aunt for support
18746,7,0,she is scared and dont know what to do she feels alone she wishes her dad was still at home
18747,7,1,that she is a hardworker
18748,7,0,a person that trying to be sucsecfule and dowhat her eldors tell her to do
18749,7,2,a trait that rose haswould be hope we can see this trait when she is talking to her sister anna and she says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for us to go to college ' in this part of the story you can shee that she understands what she has to do so that hopefully paul will help her get to college just like she did for him
18750,7,0,she is from cambodia 'in cambodia our first country what we're all doing would be quite normal '
18751,7,1,i think that rose stands her grounds she is very real about what she says and i think she really means it she also has her own opinion on things but she is very caring and i think she really loves her sister
18752,7,1,rose is very responsible she is involved with school work household chores and is also trying to be in a writing contest somehow she still manages everything pretty well
19953,8,2,paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star but he could not read 'no school wanted a runner who couldn't read ' paul listened to mr leonard about his past and realized that is was similiar to his present paul decided that because mr leonard had helped him with track that he needed to help mr leonard out with his reading 'c'mon mr leonard it's time to start your training '
19954,8,2,the background information about mr leonard relates to paul because they both couldnt read very good and mr leonard wants paul to to do better in life then what he did it effects paul by making him want to try hard in track and school
19955,8,1,it motivated him he knew what mr leonard meant and that gave him incintive to try harder
19956,8,0,the information that paul gets about mr leonard was that he was the hall monitor when paul stared middle school he tells paul that he wanted him to come to the gym at 2 30 so paul did and he remeber that mr leonard did the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke the record but he lost he scholarship and flunked out because he couldn't read so paul wanted to do the hurdles for mr leonard to make him feel like hes not a nobody and a somebody
19957,8,1,the information has an effect on paul because paul and mr leonard both have the same problem with reading mr leonard was helping paul excel at something so now paul wanted to help mr leonard that's how the background information had an effect on both paul and mr leonard
19958,8,2,as paul learns more about mr leonard he is able to see just how much alike the two of them really are an example would be paul cannot read and neither can mr leonard when he was in college mr leonard was a star hurdler as a freshman paul is starting out to have potential to be a great hurdler the last statement provides evidence on how similar the two men are paul can sympathsize with mr leonard because they are both not very good at something
19959,8,0,the effect on paul about mr leonard was that it don't matter how smart you have to play sports but it's best that you still care for your school
19960,8,2,it shows that even if you cant read just like mr leonard it dosent mean that you should stop trying in life just like when he went to college but lost his scholarship because he couldn't read that didnt stop him from breaking records on the field so it just showed paul that he shouldn't give up just because something gets hard in life
19961,8,1,he relates to mr leonard so feels bad for him
19962,8,0,he starts to realize that mr leonard is trying to teach him a life lesson on never giving up because he was a good athelete and ended up not being able to run because he couldn't read he then realized he needed to learn to read and try his best to achieve his own greatness
19963,8,2,when paul recieved the background information on mr leonard he saw a connection between them that is why later in the story they decid to start training together and since they both struggle with reading they can be better friends in understand what they are going through
19964,8,2,mr leonard isnt a good reader and so he tells paul he broke records in college but he couldnt read that good so it helped paul understand that it is good to learn how to read and over come obsticables
19965,8,2,in knowing mr leonard's background information paul feels like the two can relate now after mr leonard tells paul about his inability to read paul states 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me ' this statement supports the fact that paul feels empathy for mr leonard because the two of them have experienced the same struggle in school
19966,8,2,the background information that the reader recieves about mr leonard is that he was a track star through high school and his freshman year in college but that he didn't know how to read his grades were terrible and he flunked out of college despite being an incredible runner it didn't help him academically one of the best runners in history who broke records had more in common with paul than he could have ever imagined paragraph 45 states 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feeling of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could for him ' paul realizes that mr leonard also cannot read but took his time out of his day to teach paul how to excel at something that he did know how to do and knew how to do it very well paul returns this favor to the best of his ability by trying to help mr leonard learn how to read paragraph 46 says 'c'mon mr leonard i said walking back toward the school it's time to start your training '
19967,8,2,the backrground information that paul finds out about mr leonard has a good effect on him when he finds out that mr leonard was a good athlete but did not finish college it gave paul hope he realized why mr leonard was so interested in helping him better himself mr leonard helped paul excel and feel like he was worth something so paul felt as if he had to give a favor in return so he began teaching mr leonard how to read
19968,8,0,he is excited because he will learn how to and be good at a sport
19969,8,0,paul thinks that if he got to know mr leonard then maybe they would have something in common with him
19970,8,1,the effect the backround information has on paul is it shows him a whole nother side to mr leonard it showed him that they were much more alike them he origanally thought ' the emotion in mr leonard's words were all to familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him ' after he learns this about mr leonard he realizes he should do something for him in return ''c'mon mr leonard ' i said walking back twoard school 'it's time to sstart your training ''
19971,8,2,the background information that paul gets about mr leonard shocks him he sees that mr leonard was an amazing hurdler and he didn't even tell him about it paul asks 'why didn't you tell me about this ' and he got an unexpected answer
19972,8,0,he lost his scholarship and flunked out no ather schools wanted a runner who couldnt read he wasnt a good student and that he had no learning senters in his school
19973,8,2,the backgroung information made a similar emotional feeling come back to his mind this feeling was the way he felt when he was in fromt of other students and wasn't sure of an answer or couldn't read a passage 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me ' supports the my opinion that paul knows how mr leonard feels the effect of mr leonard's background information made paul choose to help mr leonard in reading just as he had helped paul overcome the obstacle of jumpin hurdles this is shown in this passage from the story 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him '
19974,8,1,the effection the data has on paul is a lot paul thinks it is amazing that mr leonard has done so much with his sports career
19975,8,0,when paul gets some background information on mr leonard he finds out that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals he also found out that he broke records when paul confronted mr leonard about it mr leonard told him that school was hard for him and he flunked out of college because he couldn't read paul remembered that he can read and that he can help him so that is just what he does about it
19976,8,0,mr leonard has poor reading skills and therfore had to drop out of college he was an amazing athlete who lost his scholarchip paul became an amazing athlete who can't read as well in paragraphs 4 10 he gets stopped by mr leonard and then trains more and improves during paragraphs 22 26 paul and mr leonard both have poor reading skills but are great athletes
19977,8,2,the information paul finds about mr leonard on the website is surprising to him he found out that mr leonard also had and still does trouble reading mr leonard was a great hurdler in college and flunked out of school because he could not read paul finds this to be surprising he feels empowered to help mr leonard to learn how to read since mr leonard has helped him learn to jump hurdles and get pass obstacles like not being able to read very well or at all
19978,8,2,it shows paul that mr leonard has gone through alot of the same obstacles that paul has in life he emotionally talks about how he had gone to college on a track and field scholarship but flunked out because he couldn't read and that really affected paul because he knew that feeling all too well paul was having to go to a learning center to read so he knew exactly what mr leonard went through
19979,8,1,at first paul felt a little big left out because in paragraph 35 he said 'why didn't you tell me about this ' after some of the story is revealed paul became curious and pressed on in paragraph 40 'well what happened after that ' then finally in paragraph 46 when the full story is told paul felt bad for mr leonard because the two people are very alike
19980,8,0,the backgound information that paul had gotten effect him because mr lenard couldn't read just like him so they both help out each other to learn something new
19981,8,1,the effect of the background information had a great effect on paul paul might have felt as though he is being trained by one of the best hurdlers he knows of paul was also appauled by the information he wanted to know why mr leonard stopped doing track and why did he want to trained paul
19982,8,1,paul is surprised by what he finds out about mr leonard he was kind of shocked and excited about the achivements that he had made
19983,8,0,mr leonard was a very good track runner he broke lots of records while he ran the hurdles he was a poor reader and lost all his scholarships and flunked out of college he now works as a hall monitor paul is going to help mr leonard read and mr leonard is going to help paul run track
19984,8,2,learning about mr leonard's background information gives paul a feeling of empathy and thankfulness for his trainer paul empathizes with mr leonard because he understands the embarrassment mr leonard feels due to his inability to read since he himself has gone through the same experience paul also feels very thankful for the time and effort mr leonard has given to help him he shows this thankfulness with his desire to help mr leonard learn how to read
19985,8,0,he was kind of a good kid gones bad
19986,8,0,hes a good guy
19987,8,0,it makes him think vwerry different about mr leonerd because he was not the guy he was thought out to be
19988,8,2,he was a good athlete but he wasnt such a good student mr leonard relied on his friends to help him get by he related to him because he was embarrased when he got called to read aloud it doesnt really effect the back ground so much
19989,8,0,mr leonard was ashamed although he did well in his athletics he wasnt a good student and he wanted paul to know that you cant get by easy without knowing you work he wanted paul to focus on learning but at the wsame time become a better athlete mr leonard tell paul how and what he did and college and that was depend on others to help him get by
19990,8,0,mr leonard try to be good person and he want to go to collage but mr leonard felt embarrassment
19991,8,2,the background information helps paul relate to mr leonard neither of them can read and they are both good at sports
19992,8,2,after paul finds out the background information on mr leonard he is curious on why he is still not an athlete he is also curious on why he didnt finish college but just like paul mr leonard can not read paul can feel the emotions that mr leonard is feeling paul knew them well because he knew what it felt like to be called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know the answer like everyone else just like mr leonard help paul training in becoming a great fast runner paul is taking mr leonard to the center learning center
19993,8,0,when someone gets background information on someone else they learn alot more about that person in the story paul is informed background information on mr leonard as it is discovered the information is actually similar to what paul has a problem with mr leonard couldn't read and flunked out of college cause his lack of ability to read although mr leonard wasn't a very good reader he was a very good runner when paul explains that he can't read mr leonard wants paul to run track like mr leonard did in high school he wanted paul to run so he could excel at something like mr leonard did they both had the same feelings of embarrassment for their lack of ability to read
19994,8,2,the effect it had on paul was to want to help mr leonard with his reading ability 'soon i realized what i could do for him 'c'mon mr leonared 'i said walking back toward school 'it's time to start your training '
19995,8,2,during the story paul finds out that mr leonard was an athlete who didn't go far due to his poor reading skills this information made paul feel more comfortable because he became aware that mr leonard had the same problem that he has they're both good athletes who have trouble reading
19996,8,0,they find alot out about eachother more and more while mr leaonard is training paul
19997,8,0,mr leonard couldn't read either and he's trying to say that everyone has obsticals they have to overcome in life reading is one of the things mr leonard needed to overcome but he didn't overcome it while he was in college that's why he flunked out no school wanted a runner that couldn't read so he never went back
19998,8,2,when paul found out about mr leonard's background it was all to familiar to paul paul said in the story that he knew the emotions in mr leonard's words to well feelings of embarrassment when called to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer everyone else did know
19999,8,2,i think that when paul gets the background information on mr leonard he is inspired to be just like him paul says 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records ' this shows that paul is enthused about the fact that the person who taught him to do this is a professional in his eyes
20000,8,2,the effect it has on paul is to motivating paul learned that mr leonard was a great track runner in college paul is motivated because mr leonard had the same problems paul is sturggling with
20001,8,1,the background information that was given in the story has an effect on paul because mr leonard sees himself in paul mr leonard could not read in school but was very good at track he feels that paul is going through the same thing paul feels that he can relate to mr leonard now mr leonard is going to try and help paul complete what he could not
20002,8,2,when paul found out background information about mr leonard he seemed very suprised he had no idea that mr leonard was a good athelete or that he had reading trouble before when he found out about this information he was very empethetic he said 'it's time to start your training ' in support for him
20003,8,0,it shows that paul will have a good coach to teach him how to do the hurdles when mr leonard is telling him to pump his arms and lean paul will know that mr leonard will know what he is talking about
20004,8,0,paul knew nothing about mr leonard before he started having conversations with him the most paul knew about him was that mr leonard was the hall monitor and that most of the other students obeyed him on a regular basis when the coach gave paul the url and told him to do some research on mr leonard it had a great effect on him when he did it he realized that this man was just trying to help him to overcome a 'hurdle' in his life and that he meant well mr leonard did this hoping that paul wouldnt get stuck in the same position he did and that paul could overcome it while he still had a chance and the ability to do so
20005,8,2,the information made paul want to become a better athlete and reader 'feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew ' line 46 48 this shows how paul could relate to mr leonard after he told about his past
20006,8,0,mr leonard was talking to paul about when he use to be really good in sports until he lost everything but paul new it was over so mr leonard is goin to help hem turn his life around so he can make a change not just doing good in sports but in school to
20007,8,1,the affect that mr leonards story has on paul is that it shows him he can do something if he sets his mind to it and he is trying to show him that he wants him to succed
20008,8,2,he finds out that mr leonard is actually a track star and he also can't read very well in some ways they are very much alike because paul can't read very well either but he is trained to be a great athlete by finding out more about mr leonard paul is able to compare himself to him in a 'role model' sort of way maybe with mr leonard's help paul will be inclined and encouraged to try and succeed in ways that mr leonard couldn't
20009,8,2,paul felt like him and mr leonard had stuff in common not knowing to read he felt like he had to try his best and fulfill mr leonards tasks because when mr leonard was in school he had the same problems as paul and didnt make it cause he couldn't read like he did so he was going to prove some people wrong and help paul out in hurdle
20010,8,2,he was suprised that mr leonard was a track star in college and that even though he was a teacher he flunked ou of college
20011,8,2,when paul learns that mr leonard was a talented track star he is suprised and confused then it is clear why mr leonard took interest in paul and that is because he can relate to him paul realizes this and connects them with a bond this bond is that neither of them can read well and when paul sees this he decides to act instead of being told what to do
20012,8,2,mr leonard had gone through the same thing as paul only he went throughhigh school then colege not knowing how to read then he finally flunked out of college and no other college wanted someone that couldnt read paul was trying to learn how to read and now he had a reasoon to keep going and not give up
20013,8,0,paul was effected because he has a problem reading just like mr leonard which is why paul was going to the learning center at the begining of the story paul didn't want to not learn how to read
20014,8,1,paul understood that working hard in school is still important even though it gets hard the background information also shows paul that he is almost like mr leonard because he is becoming better at track and has trouble reading
20015,8,2,the background information about mr leonard has a good effect on paul it shows paul that he is not alone with his reading problem also that mr leonard was a great runner but without education mr leonard did not become sussccefull in life it shows paul that he has to work hard in every aspect of life paul learns to be kind and help someone that helped him like at the end after learning mr leonard's past and how he can't read paul offters to train him and help him read
20016,8,2,paul learns that mr leonard was a poor reader just as paul is paul now feels like he can accomplish great things if he works hard at them then at the end he returns him a favor by helping mr leonard become a better reader
20017,8,0,he feels lied to
20018,8,0,why do i have to take this test
20019,8,2,paul seemed shocked that mr leonard never told him that he was an awesome runner but was shocked to find out that mr leonard never could read i feel like paul feels better knowing that mr leonard couldn't read either and that he wants to help mr leonard out by teaching him how to read better just like mr leonard did by helping him get on the track team i think paul found out at a good time because i feel like that if paul knew that from the beginning he would never actually try to learn to run with mr leonard
20020,8,1,the information the coach provides paul with enlightens and motivates him to make a better future for himself and to make mr leonard proud even though he is a weak reader paul finds that he is good at hurdles something he and mr leonard have in common after mr leonard shares his story paul is motivated to become a better reader as well as to help mr leonard to do so as well
20021,8,2,he is surprised that mr leonard flunked out of college he was suspicious so he decide to ask mr leonard when he did he found out that mr leonard couldn't read
20022,8,0,its makes paul wonder why mr leonard quit running track and college and when he asked mr leonard why mr leonard said it was because he couldn't read that good also it helped paul realize what kind of person mr leonard use to be like a good athlete a good person but not the smartest
20023,8,1,the background information helps paul understand why mr leonard wanted to teach him how to jump hurdles and let him pass in the hallway when going to the learning center paul also now understands why mr leonard didn't talk about his past and was so adamant to teaching paul how to jump hurdles
20024,8,2,when paul finds out about mr leonards past it changes his view of mr leonard he realizes that the two of them are more alike than he ever would have imagined he even says that he knew mr leonard's feelings too well talking about the embarrassment of not being able to read he also decides that it's his turn to help mr leonard out after everything that he's done for him as it turns out mr leonard and paul are two peas in a pod and it changes paul's view once he realizes it
20025,8,2,when a coach hides something from you feel suspcious and want get in on the action when he hid that secret about him quitting track because of his grades shocked the narrator
20026,8,2,mr leonard couldn't read and he wanted to make something of himself just like paul paul was getting tired of getting chose last for teams and not achieving so he went ahead with mr leonard's advise paul soon found out that mr leonard was just like him and paul wanted to achieve for mr leonard
20027,8,1,the effects it has on paul is to keep working hard in school and out no matter how good you are at the sport you have to do well in school also paul took that advice and started getting tutored and practicing on the track

20119,8,1,after learing this background information paul realizes why mr leonard is just like him
20120,8,0,paul would have almost the same background as him except pauls would be about high school
20121,8,1,paul realizes that it is not just him that has problems anyone can over come the problems that one might have in life and still better themselves
20122,8,1,the background information about mr leonard has an effect on paul that made him realize that he could help mr leonard in the same way he helped him at the end of the story he understood him more after and went on to help him
20123,8,1,he relixes that he was a great at the hurdels soon paul relizes that mr leonard was a track and feild star back in collage and continues to let him coach to get ready to try out for the team as paul confronts mr leonard about his past at first he seems sadened by it 'i was a good athlete ' 'but not a good student we had no learning centers in our school i relied onfriends to help me get by but even then the work was always too hard ' 'but you went to collage ' paul said 'things were different back then ' mr leonard replied 'the collage scouts told me that my grades didn't matter that i'd have tutors to help me but college work ia a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked out no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read ' 'c'mon mr leonard ' paul said walking back toward school 'it's time to start your training '
20124,8,2,paul knows how mr leonard feels he also has a difficulty reading and he understands how it feels to be embarrased about the lack of reading skills this brings him closer to mr leonard because he starts to realize they are alike in many ways other than running
20125,8,2,paul was surprised and when he confronted mr leonard about it wanted to know why he had quit he pressed for the answer by asking 'well what happened after that ' mr leonard explained that he had been a good runner but had struggled with the school work and lost his scholarship causing him to flunk our of college paul felt he could relate to mr leonard about the familiar feeling at not doing well at school and realized what he could do for him telling him 'c'mon mr leonard ' as they walked back towards the school 'it's time to start your training ' so now they have both learned something from eachother one was how to work hard and become good at a sport and then teach one how to read better
20126,8,2,paul is effected by mr leonard's background information because mr leonard can't read just like paul and mr leonard could have been a huge track star if he would have focused on his school work in high school paul is motivated to work harder on his work at school now because he wants to be somebody
20127,8,0,paul was worried about his reading dissabilities mr leonard was pushing paul to be good at track becuase mr leonard knew that paul would have a better chance then he ever would at succeeding in track and in studies
20128,8,0,mr leonard used to be a good track star but ended up dropping out because he couldn't read when mr leonard finds out paul can't read he helps him get better at hurdles then since mr leonard helped paul get better at something paul helps mr leonard get better at something he was bad at
20129,8,1,paul is effected by mr leonard's beackground information because it is the same thing he is going through and paul feels empathetic towards mr leonard
20130,8,2,the background information paul gets on mr leonard effents him because he finds out he is being taught by a former great this boosts his confidence on becoming an athelete and makes paul want to achieve goals when paul learns mr leonard flunked out it motivates him to try to get better as a student because without the grades he would never make it in college he also wants to return the favor by teaching mr leonard how to read
20131,8,0,the background information has a effect because he didn't know that he was in track and it would have been easier for paul to say something to him if he knew about it
20132,8,0,paul is used to obeying mr leonard he does not ussualy stop and talk to him and seems a little nervous around him
20133,8,2,the background information changes paul's view on the mr leonard he knows now that he can help mr leonard read while mr leonard teaches him how to hurdle in a sort of compensation in paul's eyes paul feels more motivated at the end of the story because mr leonard is like him in so many ways that he feels he can achieve something like he had done in college
20134,8,1,the information brought mr leonard and paul closer because paul felt like mr leonard's feelings of embarrassment were familiar to himself
20135,8,1,when paul finds out about mr leonard's background information he feels that he can relate to him paul could tell that when mr leonard told him what happen to him in college he was embarassed just like he was when he was chosen to read something aloud and didn't know the answer he feels grateful that mr leonard had given up his time to help him excel at something then paul felt that he had to help him out
20136,8,2,paul became very compassionate after getting information from mr leonard paul started to understand how mr leonard feeling about his life so paul decided to teach him how to read also paul got some motivations for himself by the story of mr leonard he found although he is a goodd athletic in hardle he still have to study very hard he still should finish his college and get his scholarship becasue he learned how study is important for an atheltic from mr leonard's experience no college would like to have a athletic who does not know how to read that made paul want to study harder than before
20137,8,1,the information about mr leonard effects paul greatly paul now has to goals to strive for hurdles and reading mr leonard's personal feats will push paul harder and further to reach his goals
20138,8,1,paul found information on the website mr leonard asked him to look up he found out that mr leonard was a very good athlete in college leonard won a 400 meter hurdles at nationals but he couldn't continue on in college because his grades were poor leonard didn't want paul to be like him he wanted paul to be able to be a reader and a athlete at the same time so he helped paul train and paul helped him how to read
20139,8,2,the effect on the information that paul has received is remarkable information to him he finds out that the teacher that is willing to help succeed and was doing it with a hurdle was actually a really good hurdler in school when paul takes back the information to ask mr leonard about the article paul comes with a grin on his face that to me seems like hes amazed and feels pretty grateful for someone like mr leonard to come and encourage him to keep trying with the hurdle
20140,8,0,the effect of the background information that paul gets from mr leonard is paul now knows that he is not the only one with a hard time it helps paul realize that everyone is good at one thing while another may be harder to accomplish
20141,8,2,the backround information about mr leonard excites paul because paul is likeing doing track every day and is ammazed by the success that mr leonard has had with track in college then the information about how mr leonard couldnt read inspires paul because paul is going through the same thing
20142,8,1,paul starts to understand why mr leonard is helping him with track he also realizes why the first time at the track mr leonard did not know his name
20143,8,0,the effect that the background information about mr leonard had on the reader is that mr leonard could not read and he was trying to help someone that was also in his postion so it shows that he is a kind man that cares about people and helps people if they need it the effect that the background information has on paul is that he realizes that he can be successfull just like mr leonard even though he can not read
20144,8,2,paul feels he can relate to mr leonard paul knows how if feels to not be able to read he knows how it feels to be embarrassed when called upon to read aloud also he knows how it feels to not know the answer that everyone else knew
20145,8,2,the background information about mr leonard motivated paul and encourage him of working harder there are many plots that can support the point among which one detail is predominant as it is mentioned in the paragragh when paul heard the experience of mr leonard he felt the same way as he is not a good reader and always feels the embarrassment when answering questions in front of the class mr leonard's story motivated him and implied the fact that if he doesn't study hard and give it up it will cause a great pity in his life from what has been discussed above the background information of mr leonard had a positive influence on paul motivated him to work hard and made him eager to provide help for mr leonard
20146,8,0,the backgroung information affected paul by letting him know mr leonard can't read too this shows paul that he can get better and not give up it also build his relationship with mr leonard by going to the learning center together
20147,8,2,paul is amazed he couldn't believe that he broke records in the 400 meter hurdles in college
20148,8,2,paul was surprised to find out that mr leonard had at one time run track this is evident in paragraph 35 line two when paul pulls the printout from his pocket and asks 'why didn't you tell me about this ' paul also began to relate to mr leonard after mr leonard told him that he also couldn't read this fact can be found in paragraph 45 lines 2 through 4 when paul said 'i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew ' finally paul felt that he should be kind and help mr leonard learn to read just as mr leonard had helped him learn to jump hurdles the final paragraph reads 'c'mon mr leonard ' i said walking back toward school 'it's time to start your training '
20149,8,2,paul found out that mr leonard couldn't read like himself he also found out that mr leonard was a track star and that he couldn't go any further in track than he did because he couldn't read with finding that out paul wanted to go further so he knew he needed to work hard to improve on his reading and also that maybe him and mr leonard could work on it together
20150,8,2,the background information that paul discovers about mr leonard helps paul realize that mr leonard is trying to help paul in life because no one helped mr leonard instead of just letting paul continually struggle through life and not have anyone to help him mr leonard steps up and gives paul what mr leonard himself never had
20151,8,2,the background information that paul learns about mr leonard surprises him and it encourages him to help mr leonard it surprises paul because he asks mr leonard about why he never told him that he was a track star the information also encourages him because at the end of the reading paul decides to teach mr leonard how to read
20152,8,2,he finds out that mr leonard is a poor reader and paul is also a poor reader and it makes him want to try harder
20153,8,1,in the beginning of the story paul thinks mr leonard is just the hall montitor then after he gets the background information on mr leonard his viewpoint changes he realizes that mr leonard is just like him but mr leonard didn't have a learning center to help him read when he was in school this caused mr keonard to flunk out of college which is why he is helping paul also the background information makes paul emphatic towards mr leonard and will probably cause him to go to college and not flunk out for mr leonard
20154,8,0,the background information influences paul it is because of the information that he wants to join the track team
20155,8,1,after he found out so much information about mr leonards background it incouraged him to work even harder he started to believe in himself he new that he could accomplish anything as long as he put his mind to it not only did he believe in himself mr leonard believed in him too
20156,8,2,paul feels the same mr leonard does 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all to familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew this man had to given the time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him paul is really familiar with these and feels that now he can do something for mr leonard too 'c'mon mr leonard ' i said walking back toward school 'it's time to start your training '' paul is inspired to help out mr leonard so he can properly read even though he flunked college he is eager to help it's one of the best things to do is help someone even if they are 10 or 50 years old they can always learn new tricks
20157,8,0,in this story the background information about mr leonard especially at the end is similar to the situation the narrator was in for example at the end when mr leonard mentioned that he had failed out of college which was comparable to the situation the narrator was in because of his inability to read realizing this mr leonard thinks that by having the narrator do what he did he can overcome the obstacles which were similar to the obstacles he had
20158,8,0,the effect that paul had was consideration more than anything because mr leonard was just a hallway monitor when he could of been so much more than that when paul found out about mr leonard he wanted to find out why mr leonard 'gave up' on his dream but he later found out that he flunked out of college paul found this out because he look up that url that the track coach gave him and he asked andpushed the answers to pauls questions so he tried to live his dream out on paul in a way
20159,8,1,the information paul gets inspires him to keep up the good work paul also knows that he needs to keep up his tutoring in order to stay on the team
20160,8,1,he was suprised to discover that he was so good at one point in time and he wanted to know what happened and why their weren't any other stories
20161,8,2,it makes paul feel closer to the coach because they both have the same reading problems also they are both good hurdelers
20162,8,0,in the baxkgroung ionformation it effects paul majorly because he thought that the teacher was great he did not know that he ran track or did any field activities until he recieved that website from a coach he was kind of upset about it but he got up and encouraged his teacher to get back on the track
20163,8,2,when mr leonard tells paul 'the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter that i'd have tutors to help me but college work was a whole lot harder than high school work i lost mt scolarship and fluncked out no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read ' i feel that it opeed pauls eyes and made him think if himslf i belive that information made paul think of his future and how him and mr leonard aren't that different also when paul says 'c'mon mr leonard ' 'it's time to start your training ' i feel paul and mr leonard are closer because mr leonard told paul thoes secret things about him
20164,8,2,it has a very big effect on paul because mr leonard went to college to be on the track team and he flunked out because he was not a good student paul is also having a problem with his grades because he cannot read very well so he goes to the remedial reading program twice a week and he looks up to mr leonard because he is going through the same thing that he did mr leonard flunked out of college because the college scouts told him that there would be tutors at the college that could help him get his grades up but there were'nt any so he flunked mr leonard wanted to show paul that he could do anything that he worked at and kept practicing
20165,8,2,well paul dose not know how to read that good and when he gets on the url and when he asked mr leonard about it and he says he dose not know how to read paul knows how that feels and then he gose and showes him how to read
20166,8,0,i believe that paul is changed even more by finding out about mr leonard's college life it shows paul that even if you're bad at education you can still be great at other things it opens up a new world for paul is what i'm saying overall
20167,8,2,the background information about mr leonard makes paul realize that eventhough he might be terrible at reading he needs to keep practicing and overcome his fears just like he has done with the hurdles
20168,8,2,paul learns that mr leonard was very good at track in college it effeects paul because paul is pretty much just like mr leonard he is good at track but not so good in school
20169,8,0,the background that paul got of mr leonard effected him possitively now that paul knows just because you can't read doesn't mean you can't do anything you put your mind to
20170,8,1,it tells him that if mr leonard can win at these huirdles and teach him how to do it he can teach mr leonard how to read
20171,8,0,paul is in the same situation as mr leonard when mr leonard asked paul what his name is he should of known it because he had check paul's pass for the past two weeks but mr leonard did not know it because he could not read
20172,8,2,paul feels some what connect to mr leonard seeing how they both have reading disabilty and now they are both good at jumping hurdles mr leonard that since he didnt get proper help with his reading problem and paul was that paul could do better then him with reading and track
20173,8,2,mr leonard helps paul find something that he can be good at and paul probably takes mr leonard's kindness for granted he is certainly grateful for mr leonard's kindness but fails to see mr leonard's motives when paul learns about mr leonard's background about his track and field records and how he flunked out of college it profoundly changes paul's view of mr leonard according to paul 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something' he realizes that mr leonard fully understands paul and that he's trying to give paul confidence to succeed mr leonard's story also encourages paul to help mr leonard in return by helping him improve his reading skills
20174,8,0,mr leonard is like paul a poor reader so he feels bad for him also he sees himself in him by taking him to the track he is good at track just like he was also he was a poor reader and thats why he flunked out of college
20175,8,2,in the story the trach coach advises paul to look up background information on mr leonard whe he does he discovers that mr leonard was just like him they both had problems reading therefore paul understood why mr leonard tried so hard to help him excel at something paul also understood how mr leonard felt embarrassment and the longing to be like other kids it affects paul because now he knows that he can be good at whatever he puts his mind to all thanks to mr leonard
20176,8,2,the background information on mr leonard is impowering for paul in specific ways paul had no idea about mr leonard because a track and feild star but he listened to him anyways when the coach gave him the url to look him up he was surpirsed when he confronted mr leonard about the whole thing he was surprised with his responce he wondered what happened why he hadn't done it since he won the 400 meter hurdles as a freshman paul could really relate his story to mr leonard because he as well couldn't read unlike mr leonard he had the resources to help with his problem of not being able to read when mr leonard was done explaining his story he thought since he help him that he would help him learn how to read the background information help him connect with mr leonard on a whole new level
20177,8,0,paul ask mr leonard why he kept such a proud accomplishment from him
20178,8,0,the background information helps paul by relizing if you want ot become a good athlete you have to be an even better student to do what you like do to
20179,8,1,at first paul probably felt confused and upset with mr leonard for not telling paul about his past but when mr leonard told him why he didn't tell paul paul understood why they were both in the same situation somewhat
20180,8,0,well this collage student said he want to be an athlete and win lot of matals
20181,8,2,during the story 'gifts' paul learns some interesting and shocking information about mr leonard paul finds out that mr leonard was a 400 meter champion and he questioned him what happened after once mr leonard reveals the information to paul he was shocked paul realized that he wasn't alone and he had someone who was like him someone who couldn't read knowing this paul was releaved and was glad to help mr leonard with his reading
20182,8,0,it shows him that even though mr leonard can't read that he can still do other things just as well as other people it also shows him that he will need to try hard and never give up
20183,8,2,he felt familiar with the emotions of embarrrassment that mr leonard felt paul was grateful that mr leonard had given his time to help him succeed at something he wanted to show respect and help mr leonard do something too he wanted to help him learn to read
20184,8,2,during the story paul finds out that mr leonard was once a great 400 meter hurdler paul looks up to mr leonard because he had trouble reading as well this motivates paul to work hard during school and on the track
20185,8,0,paul see's mr leonard is a role model and that paul wants to help him
20186,8,2,when paul found out that mr leonard won the 400 meter hurdle he wonderd why mr leonard didnt tell him they when paul figured out that mr leonard flunked out of college paul knew felt his pain paul also has a hard time in school paul wanted to do something for mr leonard because he helped him with hurdles paul is going to help mr leonard read
20187,8,0,the background information effects people because it showed that everybody is good at something in life
20188,8,2,he feels that it was strange that mr leonard doesn't share with him his past acheivements when he's training him to run hurdles so he is supprised that mr leonard is such a great hurdler and it prompts him to ask why he didn't continue that carreer when paul finds out about mr leonard flunking out of college he felt sympathetic for him because he couldn't read either
20189,8,1,paul seems more confident about himself that now he knows mr leonards background paul his happy that he knows somebody that also struggled in school just like him
20190,8,2,paul found out that mr leonard was a track star in college and that he flunked out due to bad grades paul was suprised that someone that good was teaching to him to succeed like mr leonard did
20191,8,1,when paul realizes that mr leonard struggled with the work required of him in high school and college he feels immediately sympathetic toward the hall monitor because of his similar situation in my opinion he most likely felt more of a connection with the older man at this point and he realized at last why mr leonard was so determined to coach him in track after school as is usually the case with students and their teachers paul is probably also somewhat surprised to discover that mr leonard has had his own difficulties in life however mr leonard's story also has another effect on paul it encourages him to work harder so he doesn't suffer the same fate after this paul will probably try to put more effort into his studies and receive better grades in his classes after being confronted with the possibilities of what could happen to him if he doesn't do so he probably has more determination not to end up losing all that he hopes to achieve like mr leonard has paul is also probably grateful to the learning center at his school which he took for granted in the past although he initially viewed it as something to be embarrassed about he most likely is now thankful that he has people to assist him and motivate him when mr leonard didn't have the same luxury
20192,8,2,the background information makes paul look at his own life and see that he is struggling with same things that mr leonard delt with mr leonard was a track star ut he could not read he flunked out of college because is his disablilty to read at the end of the story paul wants to help mr leonard out by helping him read
20193,8,2,the background information shown who mr leonard aws in the past paul seen this and was encouraged by this becasue he was like mr leonard this help him to practice runnung and he help mr leonard to practice reading
20194,8,1,paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star and stoped because he couldnt read so paul teaches him to read because mr leonard tought him something
20195,8,0,mr leonard got backgroung information o paul so he knew a little abut him this helped him do things better he practiced with him
20196,8,0,he was a hall monitor and he mad sure people were always on tie for class no matter what and then it hit him he was training to be on the track team and he trained and trained and trained and he finally saw himself before thter track coach
20197,8,1,it makes paul realize why he had him running on the track because mr leonard used to be a track star who also struggled with reading
20198,8,2,in the begininng of the story mr leonard is the mentor and helps paul feel more involved in more activities than he already was mr leonard also helps paul not feel like an outcast mr leonard stays after school even longer to help paul unspokingly mr leonard has gone through the same trouble that paul is currently facing paul then later finds that mr leonard faced the same trouble in high school paul acts as if he is the mentor when he finds out about mr leoanrd's situation in high school pauls act of saying 'it's time to start your training' to mr leonard shows the value of a true relationship paul is helping mr leonard after mr leonard helped him one kind act to another is exactly what has happened without any of the background information none of this would have happened
20199,8,1,once paul understands the background of coach it can reassure him that he has what it takes to overcome the obsticle he does not feel as isolated or alone he realizes that there are other individuals out there with the same problems and if they can overcome them he can too
20200,8,2,the narrater paul is shocked beacause mr leanard was helping him and he never told him that he couldnt read either it drove him to try harder on reading and to help him beacuse mr leanard never got the chance to get help with reading 'the emotions in mr leanard's words were all to familier to me '
20201,8,0,paul was amazed by what he found out about mr leonard he found out that mr leonard was a freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records
20202,8,2,the effect that mr leonard's background information has on paul is he can relate to him paul has a difficult time reading and was never involved with sports mr leonard can't read but was a very good athlete both of them are like one another and know how the other feels they both feel embarrassed because they can't read but like to do hurdles since paul discovered this information he wants to help mr leonard read just like mr leonard helped him learn how to do the hurdles
20203,8,1,it effected paul in a positive way it gave paul a better understanding on why mr leonard was helping him
20204,8,0,it shows that anyone can play a sport without have learning capablities also that paul could learn just about anything if he had practice
20205,8,0,paul needs help and needs to work more harder on the way he exercises paul needs to be concentrated and very smart to try new things
20206,8,2,he realizes that they are much a like they both have trouble reading it changes the way he looks at mr leonard
20207,8,1,the background information paul received was shocking but inspirational he didn't know that mr leonard was going through the same thing as he was when he was in school so he tried to help paul earlier than when he was in school because he didn't have anyone to help him early in life
20208,8,1,paul is confused and probably a little disappointed that mr leonard didn't tell him about his college days paul also understands when mr leonard tells him about his flunking out he says how the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to him
20209,8,2,after paul got a background check on mr leonard it had really touched him mr leonard explained to him that he had flunked out so paul felt empathetic and took him to the learning center
20210,8,2,when reading the article the reader first sees mr leonard as a kind of mean guy that just likes to heard people along in the hallways at schoool because he is a hall monitor later on in the story when mr leonard takes paul under his wing to teach him how to be a good runner the reader learns that mr leonard used to be a very succesful track runner and used to be very well known the reader also learns that he flunked out of college and that's why he is no longer a runner paul is a kid that can't read and mr leonard seemed to take an interest in him and was going to help him learn how to be a good runner because he thinks it will help him out paul listens to mr leonard without any hesitation and quickly learns to run very well in the process of joining the high school track team paul learns that mr leonard used to be a very well known track star this confuses paul on why mr leonard didn't tell him this when paul asks why he wasn't told he learns that mr leonard didn't tell him because he didn't want to brag about how good he used to be and that he was also embarrased because he had flunked out of school because he couldn't read the fact the mr leonard took paul under his wing to help him accomplish things in life better and that mr leonard wanted to help paul because he never got any help tells the real type of mean mr leonard is and paul sees that and is very greatful
20211,8,2,the background information that the paul finds on mr leonard is very emotional for him because he dicoovers the reason that mr leonard is so motivated to help him paul has the same problem that mr leonard has with reading but the only difference is that paul gets help for his reading and mr leonard didn't so when he sees an apportunirty to help paul he does and is return paul helps mr leonard in the end
20212,8,0,he gets information that mr leonard was a college freshmen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals
20213,8,1,mr leonard's background informatioon gave paul incouragement to do better and push harder it also helped paul to realize that you have to work in school to make the grades that you want paul could relate to excatly how mr leonard felt when paul heard mr leonard tell his story he heard the emotion in his voice that was very familiar to him
20214,8,2,during the story the reader gets background information about mr leonard the effects of that background information make paul realize that he needed to work hard for things that he wants in life this information also makes paul realize that he also experiences the same feelings while he's at school an example with details would be 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew ' also mr leonard's background information makes paul want to excel at something and paul wants to help out mr leonard
20215,8,1,when paul finds this information it leads him to feel a connection with mr leonard paul knows that this man understands the feelings of embarrassment that paul has during school or when he is trying to read
20216,8,2,when paul learns about mr leonard past it shows him that he can overcome his obstacles the way that mr leonard did paul understands why mr leonard put so much effort into him also he should continue with his training so that he can get a schoolarship like mr leonard
20217,8,2,i think that the background effected paul in a good and bad way paul understands and knows how mr leonard feels paul tells mr leonard to come on and that it is time to start his training
20218,8,0,mr leonard was a good athlete but not a good student like paul mr leonard had the same problem as paul but didn't have learning centers in high school he had to use his friends for help but it was still too hard for him
20219,8,2,in the story paul learns that mr leonard was very talented at hurdles and even broke records as a college freshman i think that this information paul learns has him a little confused on what happend to make mr leonard in the postion that he is today when mr leonard explains to him that he wasnt the strongest student and cant read very well it ties the whole story together and i think paul then realizes why mr leonard wants to train him in the end of the story they kinda let us believe that paul is going to now help mr leonard with his reading
20220,8,2,paul had no idea that mr leonard was such a famous track star he was in shock when he found out tht mr leonard had won so many trophy's and that he won the 400 meter in hurddles
20221,8,1,when paul learns the background information on mr leonard i think he felt like he had something in common with him both characters have learning disabilities and now both run track i think paul definitley felt like he had someone to look up to
20222,8,2,that he didnt know that he was a track star when he went to collage and then mr leonard told him that he dropped out because he didnt know how to read its was the same thing for paul because he is good at hurdles but he is only in highschool but he also does not know how to read but he is getting help and can read a little bit and is going to teach mr leonard how to read to
20223,8,1,after learning about mr leonard's background i think paul starts to understand mr leonard better he used to be a suspicious quiet man but now paul feels that he and mr leonard are alike in the fact that they both had trouble in school paul feels more comfortable knowing that mr leonard is like him and that he understands how paul feels
20224,8,1,paul begins to feel empathetic for mr leonard because he knows what it's like to fell embarrassed when he was called upon to read and couldn't or didn't know quite as much as the other kids i think he also realizes that there are others that have reading problems and can set those aside and work hard to achieve set goals
20225,8,2,paul can't read just like mr leonard paul knew how mr leonard felt because he too could not read paul then started to train mr leonard too read because he helped paul with something paul wanted to return the favor
20226,8,1,mr leonard's story is one that matches paul's struggles with reading this information affected paul in a way that shows even the someone with a reading problem can be anything they want to be even a track star he is glad to know that someone else has had the struggles he has and can relate to his battles with homework and reading
20227,8,1,the information paul receives helps him understand mr leonard
20228,8,2,during the story the readers gets backround information about mr leonard the backround information effected paul because they both had things in common they both couldn't read well the response with details from the story include the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew
20229,8,1,as the narorator 'paul' get more information about mr leonard he starts to relize that mr leonard had the plan to introduse paul to track when he first meet him in the hallway also it motivates paul to do good in school as well as track and it makes it so he could conect better with mr leonard because the bolth have problems reading
20230,8,2,paul is supriszed that mr leonard failed his collage classes and at the end he makes the effert to help mr leonard to read
20231,8,1,the backround information that paul gets makes him want to try even more it inspiras him to want to go to school and get good grades succeed be confedent and learn how to read
20232,8,2,mr leonard use to be a big track star he was amd excelent athlete but just like paul he struggled with learning and reading he kept the information about his past away from paul because he was extremely embarassed about him failing and flunking out of college when paul found out about mr leonards accomplishments he was confused as to why he never said anything to him then mr leonard explained to him about how he was never a very good student but colleges didn't care because he was such a greath athlete when paul is told that he was a awful reader also he felt compelled to ivite mr leonard to his learning center
20233,8,0,the information has a big effect on paul because he was wondering why mr leonard was wanting him to run track he finds out that mr lenord was a college star in hurdles and he could not read well eather so he wanted paul to have a life like he wanted to have
20234,8,2,when paul found out that mr leonard won the 400 meter hurdles he was surprised when he seen mr leonard the next day at practice he asked why he did not tell paul about his award and record breaking college life mr leonard responded with ' things were different back then the college scouts told me that my grades didn'y matter that i'd have tutors to help me but college work is a whole lot harder then high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked out no nother school wanted a runner who couldn't read ' so in the end paul had realized mr leonard had changed his life so it was time to change his paul took him to class and said 'c'mon mr leonard it's time to start your training '
20235,8,2,i think it gives paul some encourgement knowing that he was taught and trained by a national winner in track it alos opens up a few connections he as with mr leonard about being able to talk about track instead of just the learnign center mr leonard is a role model of paul
20236,8,0,mr leonards background is being a track hurdler which paul wants to find a sport that he can do so his teacher helps him and coaches him they both have or had problems with reading and they both got help for it
20237,8,2,the background information about mr leonard affects paul by making him want to help mr leonard with reading like he had helped paul with running paul had experienced some of the same things that mr leonard described from college

20444,8,0,that is not a very good reader so he went to the learning center to try to get help with his reading skills cause he really wanted to run track so he broght up his english class grade and he got torun track
20445,8,0,i think it had a bad feeling on paul at first just for the fact that he didnt tell him but once he got to know him he may have thought there is a ligit reason to why he didnt tell him
20446,8,2,the effect on paul about discovering the background information on mr leonard is empathy paul understands exactly how mr leonard feels 'embarrassed ' paul feels led that sinse his coach had taken such an interest in him and took time to help him overcome his obstacles that he should return the favor and help excel mr leonard with his disability
20447,8,0,that paul is able to do much more with this kind of help he is one of the select few of the remedial program
20448,8,2,as the story begins the reader learns mr leonard is simply a hall monitor doing his job no one really seems to take notice in him and school goes on in the same way it always does it isn't until paul gets stopped by mr leonard one day that we first get a glimpse of who this hall monitor is many foreshadowing events occur from this point forward the empathy in his eyes when he learns paul can't read the mysterious way he calls paul to the gym and then to the track and even the encouragement he gives to paul gives the reader many hints on who this character is as a person when the track coach gives paul some interesting information to look up about this said hall monitor that is when we really see who mr leonard was we learn how successful he was on the track but when asked about this we also learn how unsuccessful he was off the track paul is very shocked to hear mr leonard grabowski was an avid hurdle jumping track participent in his day but when he goes directly to the man behind all of it mr leonard he gets a more personal outlook on what it was truly like for him this gives paul a new appreciation for his education but also for mr leonard after realizing just who this hall monitor once was and in a way still is
20449,8,2,the information that the paul gets about mr leonard during the story helps him want to train harder because when he found out that mr leonard could not read and he was a track star in college it motivated him to want to try his hardest at something that he enjoyed doing

20454,8,0,the information about mr leonard shows paul that if you give up on learning or in his case trying than you could possibly loss some of the the other things you care about such as mr leonards love for track
20455,8,0,it shows me as the reader how paul's life is and what he has to go through when it shows me that it creates a bond between the character and the reader details from the story that support this are ones like ' when you're the last guy chosen for teams in gym class'
20456,8,2,the background information paul gets about mr leonard effects paul becuase he learns that mr leonard has the same feelings and the same problem he does that makes paul feel like he isn't alone and that he could try to help mr leonard with the same problem paul has with reading it also makes him feel like he can acheive things that he didn't know he could
20457,8,2,when he finds out who mr leonard really is he feel like he should help him out by showing him how to read because mr leonard shows paul how to become faster in running and give good tips
20458,8,0,the affect the background information has on paul is that paul had no clue that mr leonard ran track and was really good when paul found out he talked to mr leonard and ased him why he never told him and the reason was because mr leonard could not read either this had a big affect on pauld because paul could not read either but was really great at track
20459,8,2,the back round information he recieves about mr leonard's reading problem makes paul want to help him after he has done so much for him
20460,8,2,when paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star in colleg he then understands why he wants him to learn track because of the simularities they both have
20461,8,2,the affect that the background information has on paul is paul might have been going down the same route as mr leonard by not knowing how to read sooner or later paul was going to get tired of trying to learn how to read and drop out mr leonard kinda saw his self in paul and didnt want the same thing to happen to paul that happened to him so he made him come to the gym so that he could motivate him
20462,8,2,paul finds tha mr leonard was just like him he was good at sports but he wasnt a good student he relied on friends to help with his school work had a scholarship and flunked out mr leonard also couldn't read just like paul
20463,8,2,the effect that it has on paul is that he wants to try harder and teach him how to read the end paul tells him 'c'mon mr leonard its time to start your training' shows that he wants to teach mr leonard something
20464,8,2,when paul finds out that mr leonard can't read it motivates him to do better because that shows him that just because you can't do something doesn't mean you're not special in your own ways mr leonard teaches paul how to jump hurdles to help him become confident and enjoy life even though he's behind in learning how to read
20465,8,2,it gives paul confidence because now he knows he is not the only one that is not able to read either at the beginning of the story he felt all alone and was tired of always being the last one chosen for a game when mr leonard came along and helped boost his confidence when he found out the things about mr leonard it made him want to do good for others that struggle and so therefore paul wanted to help mr leonard how to read
20466,8,0,it has a big effect on him
20467,8,2,paul was in school and couldn't read he never knew how to read he met a school coach began hurdling on mr leonard's track became on the track team paul thought that mr leonard went to college but he was wrong mr leonard flunked paul read mr grabowski website and finally figured out that he couldn't read either he was the same as pual
20468,8,0,1 not a bad first effort 2 that was terrible3 you'll do better next time
20469,8,0,the background information that paul got from the internet showed that mr leonard use to hurdle and that he went to college but the question was why he was there after that it turned out that mr leonard didnt learn how to read either
20470,8,0,the informactin that pauls learns about mr leonard is very shocking and confused about him
20471,8,0,paul was upset that mr leonard didn't tell him about how he won national in the 400 meter hurdles paul printed the information out and confronted him and asked him why he didn't tell him about his past
20472,8,2,paul seem intrested in what had happened he was amazed that mr leonard had ran track and beat records after doing research on grabowski just like his coach had told him to do he was curious to why mr leonard had not ran anymore after that once paul had found out that mr leonard had gone through the same thing he was he knew how mr leonard had felt because he had the same feelings of embarrassment mr leonard could not read either so when he went to college he lost his scholarship and flunked out but no other school wanted a runner that could not read paul then decided to do something for mr leonard and tell him to start his training
20473,8,2,when paul found out mr leonard was in track and had broken records he was suprised and wondered why he did not hear about it before when paul figured out that mr leonard could not read he felt sympathetic for him because he wasnt good at reading either
20474,8,2,paul is suprised to see that mr leonard was a excellent runner but he also develops sympathy towards his teacher because he says in line 45 ' the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassement ' he almost draws closer to mr leonard because he realizes they both have something in common
20475,8,0,in paragraph 24 mr leonard ask paul what was his name so paul though that the was rare and also in paragraph 27 paul's coach told him to go to a track and field website and he found about mr leonard mr leonard was a good athlete before but he and paul had something in commun he couldn't read thats why when paul told him that he was going to a program where they were going to teach him how to read he let him go because he wanted paul to be able to learn so leater in life he could be someone important
20476,8,1,i think the background information about mr leonard will mtivate paul to do better he has sympathy for the man because paul has the same problem himself paul wants to help mr leonard because mr leonard helped him
20477,8,2,the effect the background information had on paul was one of surprise paul had not known that mr leonard was track star in college when mr leonard was helping him with hurdles paul did not realize this not until the high school track coach had told him to a search on mr leonard
20478,8,2,he realizes that he is just like mr leonard because they both can not read
20479,8,2,in my understanding it seemed like he was all around surprized because mr leonard was a track star and the fact he had a reading problem for the kind and friendly training mr leonard did paul felt he should return the favor and help him to read
20480,8,1,he cant read and that is mr leoard have in common with paul and that is a promblem for him
20481,8,2,in the story paul gets information on his track coach mr leonard an found out that he was a track star in college mr leonard had been a very talented runner but unfortunatley could not make it through college because he couldnt read consequently getting quicked out this applies to paul beacause mr leonard and he have something in common this inspires paul to do the best he can and to help his coach as well
20482,8,0,this background infermation that he has on paul is paul is a boy that cant read and always gets picked last so he doesnt try any sports out or anything and mr leonard is a guy that is the hall monitor and he had went to college to run track and he droped out these 2 effect each other by how they were when they were kids leonard is trying to teack paul that if he tryes something he will get it
20483,8,2,when paul finds out about mr leonard's past he is surprised paul had no idea that mr leonard had been a track star this information encouraged paul to strive in learning to read at the same time paul could relate to him paul himself has trouble with reading so he felt empathetic towards mr leonard
20484,8,0,it effects the story because paul and mr leonard are the same in ways it says in the story that paul was getting good at hurtles he just had trouble with school so he would go to the learning center mr leonard was a star college track runner but he wasnt smart enoough and didnt have a learning center to go to
20485,8,2,when paul found the information about him he was surprised he didnt know that mr leonard was that great of an athlete but when he told him he couldnt read he felt that he could help mr leonard read and he could be come a better athlete and do better in school
20486,8,0,paul was woundering why he had left college to be a hall monitor paul read how he broke record at thge college and was the best then mr leonard told him that he kind of have the same thing as paul he couldn't read
20487,8,0,paul finds out that mr leonard was a college hurdler and this makes him wonder what happend he later finds out that mr leonard is just like him he has trouble with reading and so he was flunked out of college
20488,8,1,they make paul feel sympathetic for mr leonard because it says in the text that 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all to familiar ' paul knows what it's like to feel that way because he doesn't know how to read so he feels embarrassed
20489,8,1,paul is suprised that he was a college athlete and woundered why he didnt tell him about it
20490,8,2,he realizes that mr leonard is trying to help him because he does not want paul to fail in college like did paul relizes that mr leononard is helping him because mr lenonard was in the same position he was in at that age and didnt do anything to better himself and he wants better for paul
20491,8,2,he can relate to him in the way that he can't read very well
20492,8,2,during the story the reader gets background information about mr leonard this background information has an interesting effect on paul because paul is unsure why anyone that good would be unknown paul assumes that mr leonard would have told him about his time as a college freshman winnning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals breaking the previous record as stated in the text then after learning the complete story for how mr leonard went to college still unable to read and flunked out loosing his scholarship paul then connects this information with how mr leonard asked his name when he read his pass twice a week every week and concludes that he still is unable to read and paul decides to start tutoring mr leonard to teach hi to be able to read since mr leonard had taught him to run and jump hurdles very well
20493,8,0,the information he get is about mr lenonard winning a track meet when he was in high school
20494,8,1,the background information paul finds on mr leonard has a effect on him beacuse he also can not read mr leonard is a great guy and to find out he has the same problem as him just makes it a little easier to understand where hes coming from like he flunked out of college but he was so good in sports it kinda shows paul that he can do anything as longs as you have a good education
20495,8,2,paul learns that mr leonard use to be a record breaking member of a track team after researching him paul asks what happened and mr leonard explains that his studies werent the best and that he couldnt read paul felt the same way about hiself he to feels embarrassed because he cant read something as good as other people paul decides that mr leonard helped him excel at something and that it was time to return the favor by taking him to the learning center
20496,8,0,mr leonard was suspicious about what the narrator was doing when paul told the teacher that he couldn't read the teacher helped him out to be successful when he gets to high school
20497,8,2,finding out that mr leonard couldn't read made paul want to help him learn just like mr leonard had helped paul become good at jumping hurdles in track
20498,8,2,when paul discovers mr leonard's past track excellence he becomes inquisitive then empithetic paul's natural curiosity is demonstrated by his confronting mr leonard about the startling information he discovered online his continued curiosity is demonstrated through his continual questioning and prying such as in ' but you went to college '' and 'i pressed' ' paul later becomes empethetic when he offers to 'train' mr leonard how to read and when paul states ' the emotions in mr leonards voice were all to familiar to paul ' when paul confronts mr leonard his natural curiosity turns to empathy
20499,8,1,paul felt bad for mr leonard and he is teaching him how to read since mr leonard taught him how to hurdle
20500,8,2,when paul learns about who mr leonard was that inspires paul paul knows that he is unable to read well but he is able to run well paul learns that mr leonard was the exact same way back in his high school years mr leonard accomplish much by setting national records and being one of the best runner this is told when the article says 'you were a college freshmen who won the 400 eter hurdles at nationals you broke records ' line 38 39 this proves to paul that even though he is unable to read well he is still able to be the best at something else i his life mr leonard also encourages paul whenever he tells about how he was unable to complete college because he is unable to read mr leonards says 'i lost my scholarship and flunnked out ' line 47 this statement is important to paul to because it helpps him realize that he still has to learn to read even if he is a good runner paul learns that his running life and scholarship could be lost too if he doesn't learn to read so this encourages paul to work hard and learn how to read
20501,8,2,the effects that mr leonards past was on paul was that it reminded paul of himself he felt the embarrisment when he was called apone to read or when he did not know an awnser every one else new it all reminded him of mr leanard who was a track star that flunked out of college because he could not read paul then deliberates that because leanord is helping him at track he will help leanord read
20502,8,0,mr leonard going to the learning center
20503,8,2,paul learns that mr leonard was a trackstar in college paul soon realized that mr leonard was a superb athlete but was not the best student mr leonard tells paul he flunked out of college knowing this paul is now motivated to take his grades seriously
20504,8,2,the background information that paul receives about mr leonard motivates him in two ways it motivates him to work harder on his studies and not repeat the same mistake that mr leonard made in his college days and it also motivates him to help mr leonard to learn how to read better he helps him to read better because of the help mr leonard provided him in the hurdles this is in a way his repayment to mr leonard and it will also help him appreciate school more the background information helped the paul understand more about mr leonard while at the same time it helped the reader understand the motives behind what mr leonard did
20505,8,2,when paul goes to the track coach the coach tells paul to look up the name 'grabowski ' paul follows directions and finds out about mr leonard's past the website tells paul that mr leonard broke the 400 meter hurdle record as a freshman in college when paul asks mr leonard about this mr leonard comences to tell paul that he was a fantastic runner but a less than average student paul takes this information as an encouragement it encourages him to excel in both school and sports mr leonard's past also encourages paul to help mr leonard by helping him learn how to read
20506,8,0,mr leonard was a good athlete when he was younger but he couldn't read he was just not a good student much like what paul seems to be like since he cannot read so when mr leonard sees him in the hallway over and over again going to his study tables he notices that paul seems like a motivated kid that wants to do well so then mr leonard thinks that he should ask paul to start hurdling and if he works hard in that just like he does in school then maybe he can go off to college for hurdling but if he gets good grades he won't flunk out and that will make mr leonard forget about his past a little
20507,8,2,the information concerning mr leonard gave paul motivation i believe this is because paul has finally met someone who understands his struggles with reading after discovering that mr leonard could not read paul immediately wanted to help him as mr leonard had helped paul with the hurdles paul saw that not being able to read had damaged mr leonard's life and he felt the need to help mr leonard paul shows this by saying 'c'mon mr leonard it's time to start your training ' also seeing their similarities motivated paul to better himself in education and with the hurdles this is the effect which mr leonard's background information had on paul
20508,8,1,paul is surprised that mr leonard went to collage and won nantionls when he was a freshman in collage he also was curious of why he quit
20509,8,2,the information that paul finds about mr leonard is that he couldn't read in school either but he broke records paul was shocked that mr leonard didn't tell him about how good of an athlete he was paul was also shocked to the discovery that mr leonard couldn't read either paul knew that mr leonard was probably embrassed because he couldn't read and paul knew how it felt
20510,8,0,paul might thought that he did not know what he was doing
20511,8,1,he didnt know that mr leonard was a track runner and it pushed him to do better
20512,8,2,mr leonard has helped paul building his skill as a hurdler and paul decides to help mr leonard learn how to read
20513,8,1,after learning about mr leonard's past he relizes why he is being helped by mr leonard because in high school mr leonard was a poor reader too paul decides he wants to help mr leonard to repay him for all that mr leonard has done for him by helping train to be good at something
20514,8,0,mr leondard has done well so he trys to teach someone he can pass down too
20515,8,2,after paul learns of mr leonard's past he is curious and surprised paul learned of his achievements and wondered why he didn't continue to do track after he won the nationals it was hard for paul to understand why so much talent went to waste until he found out that mr leonard wasn't able to read paul felt closer to mr leonard because they had the same emotions
20516,8,2,the background informations effect on paul is that it inspires him he sees how even though mr leonard couldn't read that he still excelled past people in something else paul looks up to mr leonard and paul wants to return the favor and help mr leonard
20517,8,0,mr leonard is a hall moniter which makes paul think that he is just another teacher or adult that nobody wants to talk to he kept students in line and out of trouble
20518,8,0,he starts workimg out with the track team
20519,8,2,the background information that paul gets makes him see that he was not the only one that couldn't read he is touched by the fact that mr leonard took his time to coach him into being better he wants to do something nice for mr leonard just like he did for him
20520,8,1,when paul gets information about mr leonard about his pass it helps to motivate him to shoot for his dreams even if he does failed atleast he try to do it
20521,8,0,background information can actualy help paul as to whether or not something has happened to the other person or not in the past and give information about a persons past
20522,8,1,he understands how he feels because he has the same problems but he is getting help and is getting better
20523,8,0,paul feels petrayed becuase he should have told him at the begginning that he was a star
20524,8,0,this information on mr leonard makes paul wonder why mr leonard didn't finish college it also made paul wonder why mr leonard had the job that he had because he was a track star and he broke records how this information and what mr leonard told him all sounded so fimiliar to him because he was treated the same way how he couldn't read and was teased because he didn't know the answer to a question that evryone else knew
20525,8,0,paul confronts mr leonard about the information he has discovered and talks about how come mr leonard didn't tell him about him breaking track records he also asks what happened to him breaking records and mr leonard told him he flunked out of college
20526,8,1,paul was pretty shocked when he learns more about mr leonard he is also very suspicious because mr leonard never shared this with him knowing this helped motivate paul in track and learning to read
20527,8,2,paul was a poor reader knowing that mr leonard had flunked out of college just because he was a bad learner made him realize that they had something in common mr leonard worked with paul to get better at track mr leonard told paul to keep trying and work hard paul hearing this knows now that you have to keep working hard and keep trying to succeed paul knows that mr leonard should keep trying with his grade and in time he will get better
20528,8,0,near the end of the story paul reads that mr leonard has had problems with reading although he was a great track hurdler that had a big effect on paul because paul has the same problem which is that he can't read he goes to the remedial reading program so he can learn to read the coach knew that so he had paul do the hurdles so he could show paul that even though you can't read you can still do well in other areas but you should still try your hardest cause life is hard when you can't read well
20529,8,1,it made him think about his reading problem and that he needs to keep it up and he'll get better which motivated him to help mr leonard to learn to read
20530,8,0,the words that mr leonard said were all too familiar to paul he felt embarrassment when he got called on in class to read out loud
20531,8,1,the effect that mr leonard's background has on paul is really powerful paul realizes that this teacher isn't just some other annoying teacher mr leonard was in the exact same boat as paul was in and gave him advice on how to overcome it and encouragement to let paul know he could do it depsite being unable to read very well
20532,8,2,when paul finds out about mr leonard's past paul feels like he can relate to this paul says after learning how mr leonard funked out of college because he could not read 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment ' 45 this describes the situation paul is going through right now and it provides a stronger connection between the two characters
20533,8,0,the background of mr leonard is something he himslelf wishes he could change he is dissapointed that he dropped out of college and was force to quit track these are lessons to the narrator because he is young enough to take a stand for himself and outline his life by knowing what he needs to know if he keeps working on his english struggles he will become better and better it is a lesson to make school a priority of track it also shows the narrator that if he works really hard at something and gives it 100 percent he can accomplish anything
20534,8,0,the coach for the track team tells paul to look up grabowski on the website when he got home when he did this he relizes that the man who had been teaching him to hurdle was once a record breaking great athlete when paul confronts him about this grabowskibegins telling paul about his past and how he had actually lost his scholarship and flunked out of college because he could not read that's when paul learns that he couldn't read either then paul decides to help his trainer 'train' learn to read
20535,8,0,mr leonard use to be a runner as well
20536,8,1,it reminds him of his self from being good at track but not academically good atleast in reading
20537,8,1,mr leonard went through similar expirences as paul like he relied on friends to help me get by
20538,8,0,he felt bad for leonard becasue he was a good rinner but a bad reader and lost his scolership and droped out of college
20539,8,2,when paul learns that mr leonard was a star track and field athlete in college he becomes confused as to why mr leonard kept it from him mr leonard then went on to explain that he had difficulty reading and flunked out of college paul felt empathetic because he had the same problem with school realizing that mr leonard had helped paul excel at something paul decided to start 'training' mr leonard how to read
20540,8,1,he seems surprised by it
20541,8,1,it makes him feel better about himself it makes him want to put forth effort and get things acompleshed
20542,8,1,that he knows if he puts his mind to it he could do anything because once he saw that mr leonard use to run track and he didnt know how to read then he knew that he could get really good at reading because look mr leonard is a teacher and he use not beable to read
20543,8,2,paul learns that mr leonard was a track star in college which seems to inspire him he wanted to know about his experience and as mr leonard told him about it paul began to realize that he and mr leonard were pretty similar mr leonard taught paul how to run and do hurdles and paul wanted to help teach mr leonard something
20544,8,0,the effects it has on paul is he is angery because mr leonard was a really good 400 meter hurdles now he is at a high school teaching paul how to run track
20545,8,1,it shows why mr leonard became friends with paul and taught him how to run track and it made paul want to do good at track and learn how to reead
20546,8,2,paul realizes that the learning center will only help him and that he doesn't want to lose his dreams like mr leonard did because he can't read mr leaonard tol dhim that nobody wants a track star that can't read and when paul realizes this he knows that he has to try to make what he wants in life happen
20547,8,2,paul was surprised when he found out that mr leonard couldn't read either paul would have never know unless the coach had gave him that website it made paul want to try harder to learn to read so he could give something back to mr leonard
20548,8,1,the background information that paul learned about mr leonard motivated him it showed paul that he could succed in something other than reading just as mr leonard did just like the confidence paul showed when talking to mr leonard after he found out about mr leonard's past
20549,8,2,paul is surprised by the fact that mr leonard flunked out of college but as he is listening to him speak about his failures he realizes that he feels the same about his grades paul recognizes that 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something' and decides to help mr leonard with schooling because he was never good at it
20550,8,1,he can relate to him
20551,8,1,whern paul realized mr leonard had the same problems as him it created a bond between them and they could understand where eachother was coming from
20552,8,0,mr leonard was a major track star in college but they found out that he could not read so he lost his scholarship and he flucked out of college they did not wanted a kid that could not read mr leonard did not wanted paul to be like him so he told him all about his pass so he could get his grades up and go to college
20553,8,0,after paul was informed about mr leonard's backround he seems to get closer to mr leonard because they had a lot more in common then he had thought both mr leonard and paul had trouble with reading which caused mr leonard to want to help paul
20554,8,1,the background on mr leonard inspired paul to succeed in track because of the expectations he had on him paul didn't want to let him behind because all the motivation he had encouraged him with and the reputation behind mr leonard
20555,8,1,paul was surprised that mr leonard was a track star in college paul is also excited about his newly found knowledge of mr leonard he felt like he knew what mr leonard felt the embarrassment shows they are a lot alike
20556,8,0,it made him feel sorry for mr leonard since he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college
20557,8,0,to standy on top of things
20558,8,0,the nararator becomes more accepting of his mentor and coach he feels that he has good support under his feet as he takes the path of the sport you can tell from the way the narrator speaks to mr leonard after he finds out about mr leonard's past
20559,8,2,though just a lowly hall monitor mr leonard used to be an extreamly successful track star when paul discovers this he wonders what went wrong in his life to pull him away from a life of success into being a hall monitor mr leonard then tells about how he couldn't read just like paul it affects paul in two ways first it makes him realize why mr leonard wanted him to start running because he saw himself in paul second it made paul realize that they had alot in common as well and made him want to persevere
20560,8,0,mr leonard wants this boy to graduate college but he dont trust him
20561,8,2,at the beginning of the story paul is having trouble in school reading is difficult for him and he is picked last for teams in sports the hall monitor mr leonard decides to help paul by coaching him in hurdling paul gets background information about the monitor and is surprised by what he finds his coach was a freshman at college when he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records the problem was mr leonard had dropped out of college because he was failing he couldn't read very well either just like paul school was too difficult for him and he had to give up what he loved because no other college would accept him paul was moved by this and decided to get mr leonard a tutor so he could reapply to a college and live his dream
20562,8,0,the background information helps paul because we now know that he has a former highschool track runner that broke records as a hurdler to help him be better as a hurdler than just a hall monitor
20563,8,0,the effects that the background information had on paul were that he realized that just because you're bad at one thing doesnt mean that you're bad at every thing you do this is because he learns that leonard also had problems reading but could win nationals as a freshman in the 400 meter hurdles
20564,8,2,the effect the background background information about mr leonard has on paul is he can empathsize with mr leonard paul struggled reading and then mr leonard helped him with hurdles and track when paul learned that mr leonard had flunked out of college even after being a big track star ''the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me '' paul related to mr leonard's failure of college and the fact he couldn't read because paul also struggled in it the effect it had on paul was the he was familiar with the feeling it is foreshadowed in the last sentence that since mr leonard gave his time up to help paul excel at hurdles he was going to help mr leonard at reading
20565,8,2,paul is overwhelmed that mr leonard has set and broken records at college he was shocked that lead to him dropping out of college because he did not have very good grades
20566,8,1,i believe it gave paul a sense of respect for mr leonard and courage to continue what he is doing since mr leonard went through the same problems as paul did and still went to college i believe paul gained respect since the hurdle mr leonard went over must have been difficult he also must have gained courage since if one person could do it he can do it as well
20567,8,0,he is a good people he is smart he is a inteligent and hava a talentenyng and he wanr mark the diferent adn the other people
20568,8,1,paul is surprised on what he has learned about mr lenards back ground and he ask him what happend to him
20569,8,0,mr leonard didn't want to tell paul about him being a track star in college becuase maybe he was ashamed that he had flunked out and didn't want him to know that he had trouble in school sometimes too
20570,8,0,finding out mr leonard went to college but flunked out allowed paul to think about his future in their talk about college paul realized they have alot in common for example 'i knew them well feelings of embarrassement when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew '
20571,8,2,the effect of paul about the background information about mr leonard is that paul and mr leonard is almost alike because mr leonard and paul can't read and they both have run track in high school paul is willing to hepl mr leonaard with his problem
20572,8,1,it made paul realize that mr leonard is very similar to himself it also gave paul the courage to contine in his track training paul felt very connected and concerned with mr leonard
20573,8,0,mr leonard used to be a track star in college and he also doesn't know how to read so the influence that that had on paul is that even though you can't read that doesn't degrate you from doing other things in life
20574,8,1,when mr leonard's past is revealed it says the two of them on an even field paul can now relate to mr leonard and understand that he is not alone this information allows paul to respect his 'coach' even more now
20575,8,0,i think paul is a great guy
20576,8,1,when paul knows about the background information about mr leonard he identifies him self on what he says because mr leonard couldn't read like paul but what was different is that the schools before didn't have anything to help students then what mr leonard is trying to do is to show that he is aforcanet for having a learning center that can help many students know then what they had then
20577,8,2,he could feel what mr leonard was feeling and he felt as if he needed to help with out with something just as he helped paul so he was going to teach him how to read
20578,8,0,the background information helps paul realize why mr leonard is so interested in hurdling but then leads him to wonder why it is that mr leonard is trying to help him learn to jump hurdles rather that anyone else
20579,8,2,the background information has a significant effect on paul when paul first learns from his coach that mr leonard was a star athlete he goes and asked about what happened mr leonard told paul that he could not read and fluncked out of college which paul himself could relate to in the end they both bettered the other and a way
20580,8,2,when paul finds out about mr leonard's past he is shocked at first mr leonard used to be a very successful track athlete however he didn't have the grades to continue doing well in college and he eventually lost his scholarship i think paul relates to what mr leonard went through so well is because paul was basically going through the same thing he had to go the learning lab because he was unable to read not only could he not answer the right questions or read in class but he was extremely embarrassed he was afraid that he wouldn't be able to do anything since he believed that he wasn't that smart mr leonard explains that he didn't have the resources when he was a child that paul has now all mr leonard had was friends to help him and unfortunately that didn't help his grades get better he wants paul to continue learning and to be succesful since he knows what its like to not be able to read paul is affected greatly by the information he learns because he is going through the same thing he relates to mr leonard and in the end that is why he decided that he would help him and get him to read
20581,8,1,when paul get's the back ground informtion about mr leonaredhe feels better because he know's now that not only does he stuggle but mr leonared did as well this help's paul look past the reason's he has to go to the learning center and let's him focus on the thing's that he want's to do in sport's and now paul can focus on being a better player all around in every sport he is in or try's
20582,8,2,the background infortmation effects paul because it makes him want to work harder also it makes paul have empathy for mr leonard for example at the end when he says 'c'mon mr leonard it's time to start your training ' paul wants to help mr leonard get back into track because he can tell mr leonard really enjoyed it when he was younger
20583,8,2,it turns out that mr leonard had trouble reading just as paul did he flunked out of a collage that he got a track scholarship for he taught paul how to run track well and when paul looked up mr leonards information he found that he was just like him it made paul feel closer to mr leonard and he helped him read the way he had helped him run track
20584,8,0,the information it like how paul is struggling to read and that m leonard was going throught the same thing and that if he helped paul then paul would help him read and overcome the embarrasment of not being able to read well
20585,8,0,he finds out the mr leonard doesn't know much about sports soo he tries to help him as much as he can
20586,8,2,the effect on the backround information on paul seemed like they made them very similair in a way mr leonard was a good athelete and couldnt read paul became a good athlete and is trying his harderst to learn how to read there is a connection between them when they first met mr leonard knew his own past and found out that paul could not read mr leonard wanted paul to be like him in a way just be better the backround information that paul found out made him realize that they are the same and that mr leonard just wanted to help paul with his future and not be a hall monitor but to be somthing more succesful

20589,8,0,the effect of the background information on mr leonard is good and bad information some good news is that he is a good track coach but the bad is he fluncked out of school
20590,8,2,the backround information that paul finds out about mr leonard effects him in a positive way because it makes paul feel like someone else has gone through exactly what he is going through at that moment in time mr leonard states that he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college because no school wanted a runner who could not read paul goes on to say that he knows mr leonard's feelings of embarassment all to well happening whenever he is called upon to read something aloud or when he does not know an answer everyone else knows in class
20591,8,1,the story has an effect on paul because he got the website url from the high school track coach and paul went and looked at the website and seen some information he didn't know about mr leonard and wondered why he never told paul and then paul and mr leonard talk about it after paul showed him the page he printed off and then paul realized what he could do for mr leonard after hearing the story

20594,8,0,conversations about how i cant read
20595,8,0,both paul and mr leonard are poor readers paul feels he's not good at sports mr leonard used to be a great hurdler so he teaches paul how to be a good hurdler when paul finds out that mr leonard is a poor reader also he brings mr leonard to the learning center to help him
20596,8,2,i feel that the background information that paul discovered about mr leonard gave paul motivation paul never tried any sports or extracurricular activities until mr leonard helped paul to achieve jumping hurdles even though paul was good at jumping hurdles he felt as though he wasn't good enough when paul found out that mr leonard went to college for jumping hurdles but that mr leonard flunked out it make paul want to try harder in multiple things he wanted to try to get better at hurdles but he also wanted to finally learn how to read so that he didn't end up like mr leonard paul even decided that since mr leonard helped him achieve something he was going to help mr leonard learn how to read

20601,8,2,paul is encouraged after training and learning that mr leonard also could not read he was encouraged to teach mr leonard to read while paul himself was being coached mr leonard knew what paul was going through which is a reason he had paul start hurdleing in the first place and when paul found out that mr leonard had been in the same boat that paul was in it made him look at life in a new way
20602,8,0,mr leonard was a tough stick to the rules kind of man and this made paul obey him paul would never question mr leonard or make rude comments because mr leonard was too stern in the story it said that mr leonard would stand in the hallways and say 'move along people move along ' this shows that he was in charge and always followed the rules also paul had known mr leonard since he started middle school

20625,8,2,i think paul is shocked too find out that mr leonard broke records he asked questions about it and seemed very interested
20626,8,2,as paul learns of mr leonard's past he is a bit moved he realizes though he is becoming good at hurdles he needs to learn to read so he doesn't become like mr leonard he also realizes then that education comes before athletics paul can relate to all of this because he is in that current situation in 45 it says 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew paul then decides that mr leonard has done him a favor and has helped him reach a goal to excel at something 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him line 48 paul realizes that he needs to excel in academics now and help mr leonard in the process

20631,8,1,paul gets to know mr lwonard better throughout the story i feel like they had a lot in common so they got along well together they both didn't know how to read and they both could jump hurdles i think that paul felt like he wasn't an outcast any more becuase he found someone that was like him in so many ways i think he found a friend that day

20675,8,0,he feels sorry for paul for having struggles with reading because my leanard knows exactly how it felt to succeed so well at something but in the same aspect he was not a good student and no school wanted an athlete who could not read he did not want paul to go through the same expierience he did with being so talented but the difficulties with reading held him back from being able to do what he was good at
20676,8,0,paul gets on the computer and finds out htat mr leonard has many track records from when he went to school and wonders why he is a hall monitor and why mr leonard didnt tell him about his records
20677,8,1,paul is stunned on how good mr leonard did on his track and feild team but is also wondering why he gave it up
20678,8,2,at first paul just sees mr leonard as the hall monitor in his school then when the track coach tells him to search the hall monitor on a track and feild website he finds out that mr leonard was a running star when he was young and also by asking mr leonard he finds out that he cannot read just like paul it gives paul a whole new perspective on mr leonard because he then understands that the reason mr leonard is helping him is that he was just like paul at that age and he can relate to him
20679,8,0,the background information had a negative effect on paul paul saw that he was an amazing track runner but now he's just a hall monitor what happened to his big chance in a good carer so it kinda gave paul a loss in hope for sucess
20680,8,0,paul finds out that mr leonard was a great athlete in college and that he had broken many track records while winning nationals so paul then knew that he had been coached by a great athlete he then finds out that mr leonard wasn't such a good student and that he flunked out of college this reminded him of himself he was good at running but not too good at school after finding that out he wants to help mr leonard how to read just like mr leonard taught him how to do hurdles

20682,8,2,the highschool trach coach handed paul a url for the internet to visit paul printed out the page from the internet and handed it to mr leonard the url happened to be about mr leonard's past he happened to be a record breaking track star as a freshman but then he flunked out of college this forms a unique bond between paul and mr leonard because they both struggle with school and reading at the end paul says 'it's time to start your training' paragraph 46 this shows that paul is grateful for mr leonard coaching him and bringing joy to an area of his life he had yet to feel in return paul is willing to teach mr leonard how to read
20683,8,0,he found out that mr lenoard is not doing well in some things he did not go to college thinking that he would flunk it so that is the reason why
20684,8,2,the coach gives paul a website to go to on the website he finds out about mr leonard being a college runner in the 400 meter hurdles the next day he goes to the hall moniter and ask why he never went anywhere pulling out the print off he simply replied in sorrow he couldnt read this inspired paul knowing that mr leonard took the time out of his day to help him that's why paul is hepling him learn to read
20685,8,2,the first information that paul learns about mr leonard is that he is a hall monitor whose job it is to keep things moving the effect of this information is that when mr leonard coaches paul in track paul obeys because that is what he is used to doing when mr leonard tells him to do something later paul learns that mr leonard was a track star while he was a freshman in college and that his career came to a halt due to the fact that he was not a talented reader paul's learning of this new information ignites empathy in him and makes him feel like he and mr leonard are not all that different paul is getting better at reading by visiting the learning center and it is implied that he would like to give this same gift to mr leonard paul's newfound knowledge of mr leonard's background evokes this generosity
20686,8,2,paul realizes that mr leonard is a lot like him they both can't read but are willing to try and get better at anything at the end of the story paul tells mr leonard 'it's time to start your training '
20687,8,0,mr leonard was a track star back in his day paul whats to be goood at something in his life like mr leonard
20688,8,0,i think that paul can really do what he want if he just set his mind to it and he can be anything he want but i also think he can be a runer
20689,8,2,when paul reads background information on mr leonard he is shocked to see that he had won the 400 meter hurdles and broke records he wondered why mr leonard hadnt told him his past in the first place
20690,8,0,the effect is embarrassment and and sadness here are details from the story 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew '
20691,8,1,paul relizes that he is not alone and has a coach who delt with the same things as he currently is paul is suprised when he first finds out and then when mr leonard tells him more of the story he understands why he is helping him
20692,8,2,when paul recieves the informaton on mr leonard he feels as if he is in the same boat as him paul feels like he can relate to him in a way that he never has before in the story paul is confused when mr leonard asks his name after seeing all the hall passes but after he finds out that he can't read he wants to start training mr leonard so that he can appreciate what he had done for paul during the track season
20693,8,1,paul learned beckground information about mr leonard that was revelant to his own life paul learned that mr leonard was a great hurdler but was awful at reading paul also learned that mr leonard failed out of college for not being able to read paul knows that he is not very good at reading and being in this remedial program will help him learn to read better and maybe one day he will go to college for hurdles but not fail out
20694,8,0,it makes paul curious you can tell this because he asks mr leonard why he he had not ever mentioned it to him another reason you can tell it makes him curious is because paul asks other questions about mr leonards past like 'what happened '
20695,8,0,it makes paul ask why mr leonard did not tell him this
20696,8,0,paul feels bad for mr leonard because he has the same problems as him at the end of the story paul says to mr leonard indirectly that he was going to help him learn how to read
20697,8,2,paul sees that mr leonard was an amazing athlete but his athletic career was takin away from him because of his grades mr leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out of college paul is intrigued to hear this and it makes him want to do better as a student and as an athlete
20698,8,1,before paul knew of mr leonards disability he had just thought of him as some one who didnt know what they were talking about that mr leonard didnt really understand who paul was and didnt understnd pauls' disabilities after reading the passage paul realized that mr leonard had full empathy for him and uunderstood paul to the fullest mr leonard then had a bigger empact on paul because now paul sees what he can become and what he has to do to become whatver it is that he wants
20699,8,1,i believe that the information that he learns about mr leonard makes him have a very close connection with him he realizes that his life is a lot like mr leonard's life but that he has a chance to change his future
20700,8,1,the effect the background information has on paul is that he will probly work harder on his reading so he wouldnt end up like mr leonard and loose his scholarship
20701,8,0,because he wamted to learn evreything that was going on with him to get a better feel
20702,8,0,because things where different in college and evrything
20703,8,0,when mr leonard staredmiddle school he new mr paul as a hall monitor whoes job it was to keep students movieung along form on class to another mr leonard cant reade ether
20704,8,2,paul finds reading hard so does mr leonard when paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star but couldn't read this reminded him that he couldn't read if mr leonard could read but can be a track star then paul can work on his reading and become a track star mr leonard's history shows pail what he can become
20705,8,1,it gives paul modivation to excel in the hurdles and also to help mr leonard in areas he struggled with to the background information also gives paul a feeling of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer everyone else knew he then realizes that mr leonard is helping him to excel in something to make him feel important
20706,8,1,when paul got background information on mr leonard that effected paul to feel like he isn t the only one that has a reading problem at school and couldnt read that well and it also made him feel just like mr leonard because he was always pick lasted for a team so he also started training and got really good at sports so he wasnt chosed last anymore
20707,8,1,when paul finds out the background information about mr leonard paul seems more interested in him paul asks questions about his past and why he didn't go further with his talent when mr leonard tells paul about his past it shows a connection between the two and shows paul that he can be successful in life
20708,8,2,paul is very shocked by what he see's on the internet about mr leonard it also encourages paul to good in track and in school now because he has seen what happened to mr leonard by not being able to read
20709,8,1,the background information on mr leonard effects paul by helping paul recognize that mr leonard never learned well and he needed learning centers mr leonard was a good athlete but he was never an exceptional learner through this paul gained the need to help mr leonard learn
20710,8,2,the effects it has on paul are sad he didnt know that mr leonard failed college mr leonard felt ashamed which made paul want to do good
20711,8,0,mr leonard and paul both had something in common they had a hard time reading when paul ran into mr leonard in the hallway he asked for his pass and asked were he was going paul told mr leonard he was going to learn to read because he couldnt mr leonard eased up and let him go through as if he knew what he was talking about now mr leonard is their track couch and paul is very good now just like mr leonard was
20712,8,2,he is shocked and can't believe he was in college for hurdles also he didn't know why he didnt tell him before ' why didnt you tell me about this before '
20713,8,0,that mr leonard was a collage track super star and he broke records it had a negative and a postive effect on paul it put him down that the man who had been helping him had not told him that he was a track star but it also helped him when he confronted mr leonard about it
20714,8,2,when mr leonard told him about is college days paul wanted him to coach and train him because he was a good coach to him paul felt the same when mr leaonard told him about is past about no being able to read so paul wanted to work hard to know how to read so he could go to college and run track
20715,8,0,it makes paul seem more able to read by using an adult who has trouble reading as another example it also makes paul feel less inferior to mr leonard at the end of the story paul makes a statement that begins the idea that paul then helps mr leonard with reading
20716,8,0,it show paul that people aare like him so there is more than a select few it can be paul being just like mr leonard so if he becomes a better reader he can go on to college and do great things
20717,8,1,i believe that the background information paul receives effects paul in such a way that he feels inspired encouraged and feels like the sky is his limit
20718,8,2,after paul finds out that mr leonard was a major track star in college along with finding out that mr leonard flunked out of college because he could not read this inspired paul to help mr leonard after paul and mr leonard talked about mr leonards college accomplishments paul thought of an idea paul was going to go help teach mr leonard how to read since mr leonard helped paul with running track and becoming faster and more athletic
20719,8,2,when paul finds out the mr leonard was a champ track runner in his college days his becomes curious as to why he would quit if he had goen as far as setting records he soon finds out that mr leonard also could not read just like paul this made paul think that mr leonard had helped him so now it's time to return a favor and tell him to 'c'mon it's time to start his training' as he walks towards the school
20720,8,1,he discovers that mr leonard is is just like he is he relizes that not beening able to read is not a bad thing
20721,8,0,mr leonard was a good athlete but poor student his college work was harder than high school work so he lost his scolarship and dropped out he said the coach did not want a runner that could not read
20722,8,0,he wants to be like mr leonard and be a track star he wants to be smart and able to read
20723,8,2,in the story our narrator paul finds some background information on mr leaonard this information impacts paul greatly in the story his attitude and the way he sees things change completely when paul had said 'i knew the well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read alouf or when i didn't know an answer everone else knew ' paul understands how mr leonard felt about not knowing what it was like to not be the best student in the world and having to get help from people paul feels for mr leonard and he sympathizes for him pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says 'it's time to start your training ' now the paul realizes that mr leonard can not read he wants to help him out to repay him for helping him find his secret talant
20724,8,1,when paul found out that mr leonard was a good track star and that he didn't go to college because he couldn't read it reminded paul of his self
20725,8,2,paul realizes that mr leonard was once very famous and good at track and he now understand that he wants paul to follow in his footsteps in a sense mr leonard also is not good at school like paul and wants to give paul something that he can be good at and feels that track could be great for paul
20726,8,2,the background information effects paul because it makes paul want to help mr leonard learn how to read when paul figured out that mr leonard was a track star during college by the url given to him by the track coach he acts suprised and decides to help mr leonard learn to read
20727,8,1,paul most likely now understands why mr leonard is encouraging him to do the races and wants him to go to college and graduate
20728,8,0,mr leonard was a star track runner and a horrible reader too
20729,8,2,the background information about mr leonard effects paul by showing him and inspiring him with a story that is somewhat similar to his own he knows that mr leonard and himself have things incommon they are both very bad readers and are good at running hurdles
20730,8,1,paul understood better why mr leonard took care of paul when paul told mr leonard he couldn't read that was a sign right there that he was going to look after him and make him a star with this back ground information paul felt more emotionally connected to mr leonard because he went through the exact same things in his life he felt like there was someone else out there and this man was just trying to help paul succeed at something
20731,8,1,the background information has a big effect on paul it motivates paul to do even better since him and mr leonard had similar problems in school
20732,8,1,the background information that mr leonard has on paul would make him feel sometype of sympathy for him it would make him work harder and do better to get paul on track
20733,8,2,the effect that background information has on paul is that he now feels connected to mr leonard because they both went through the same thing in not being able to read very good paul knows exactly what it felt like to not be able to read
20734,8,1,the information he finds about mr leonard effects him alot because he relizes how much they are alike to eachother they both have reading disabilities and he is trying to help him to get over that and not to affect him mr leonard gets him on the track and trains him because that is what he used to do and he wants to pass it on
20735,8,2,paul feels sympathetic for mr leonard when he finds out that mr leonard can not read i suspect that this is because paul could not read very well paul states 'the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarassment when i was called when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew ' paul knows that this was the way that mr leonard felt in high school and college
20736,8,2,he realizes the importance of working hard learning to read and doing well in school he handed the print out of the web page to mr leonard and ask him what happened to him and mr leonard told him his story at that moment paul realized that reading and graddes were important and mr leonard didn't want him to suffer the same way he did
20737,8,1,i believe that gives paul the narrator and the reader background because it shows us how important that education is but to paul it's someone he can look at and understand it gives a sence of companionship with others because he is slower at reading so are others he is not alone it also tells paul that he can be good at things even if he is not so great at reading that is why i believe that it gives background information
20738,8,0,paul sees that just because you cant do something right you can work hard to overcome any obstacle
20739,8,1,mr leonard asking the narrator has set paul into the right frame of mind by knowing that life always has obstacles paul also relized that mr leonard was always there to help and making paul motivated to read everyone knows that reading is something you need to do not maybe want to do
20740,8,1,paul realized that even though your not good at one thing that you can't be good at something else just like when paul talks about he knows the feeling of embarrassment when he was called upon to read aloud or when he did'nt know an anwser everyone else knew paul realized mr leonard gave his time to help him excel at something and that its okay to not be good at something you just have to work at it harder
20741,8,2,mr leonard's past motivates paul to succed and do his best in reading and hurrdiling as well 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew this man had given his time to help me excel at somethng suddenly i realized what i could do for him '
20742,8,0,the effect of this was to show that the hall monitor was not just a hall monitor but a record breaking track runner also so that the boy could think he could do the same the man did but this time graduate from college because he will be able to read and write
20743,8,1,it reminds him of himself and makes him think he will turn out just like mr leonard mr leonard couldn't read and flunked out of college and since paul can't read either he probably thinks that he will end up doing the same and flunking out of college
20744,8,2,he finds out that mr leonard and paul both have problems reading so he feels better about him self
20745,8,0,paul finds out that mr leonard was a great track star yet flunked out of collage because he couldnt read 'no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read '
20746,8,0,he got upset cause he never told him
20747,8,2,before learning of mr leonard's background paul is ashamed by his inabiliy to read once mr leonard gets paul running track and builds his confidence paul finds out that mr leonard use to be a track star when paul questions mr leonard about his previous track experience in college he learns that mr leonard flunked out of college after his freshman year due to reading and homework troubles paul realizes that he his not alone in this world and that others struggle the same way he does 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me ' he also learns that just because he struggles in school doesn't mean he can't succeed with his dreams he just has to work hard and have the right demeanor
20748,8,1,paul actually wants to do this now that he knows mr leonard was a hurdler himself and that he flunked out of college an example from the story was when he thought to his self that the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him
20749,8,0,the efect that mr leonards has on paul is that he is in the same position as mr leonard and he does not want to take the same route as mr leonard and ruin the chances of having something good going for him
20750,8,2,when paul finds out about mr leonard's past he is interested and wants to know more once mr leonard explains what happens paul understands 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me ' is what went through his mind this encourages paul to help mr leonard learn to read
20751,8,2,paul learned that mr leonard was a track star who also couldn't read his inability to read made life a lot more difficult for him more difficult than it was for all of the other people that had gone to school with him paul who also couldn't read felt close to mr leonard he felt empathetic he understood the hall monitor's emotions completely he could identify with the embarrassment he felt mr leonard had given paul hope he had shown him about hurdles and taught him how to jump over them efficiently and effectively eventually paul was able to join the track team it had given him the chance to excel at something like never before after hearing mr leonard's story he felt as though he should give back after the story ends it's clear that paul is helping to teach mr leonard how to read so that he too could feel accomplished with himself
20752,8,1,he was amazed by his accomplishments and wondered why even though he went to college he had problems with school work
20753,8,0,m r leonard feel s that paul is just like him in ways he couldnt read so he had to flunk out of college and he didnt want that to happen to paul
20754,8,1,it in a way gives him confirmation on why mr leonard did the things that he did and why he had taken a liking to paul becasue when mr leonard was younger he was alot like paul so i can only figure that it helpred mr leonard move on from the past because he seen so much of himself in paul
20755,8,0,it makes him feel discouraged and angry paul is upset because he cant do something that leonard can do
20756,8,0,the effect on the background that he has on paul was because on lines 3 and 4 mr leonard talks and says 'hey my friend where do you think you are going' then paul says the 'learning center' then he tells him that he can't read and later finds out that he excels in track later in the story
20757,8,2,the background information paul learned form mr leonard made a diffrence once paul learns that mr leonard had been in hurdles in high school and that had broke records he asked mr leonard why then mr leonard explains everything just like paul he had also been good in hurdles and had trouble reading though it didn't seem like a problem then his college scouts told him that they weren't important but by the time he got to college he realized grades were important not being able to read he flunked college and lost his scholarship this made paul think of all what mr leonard had done for him since he was going through the same he was good in a sport but not so good as a student then realizes mr leonard does this to help other students
20758,8,1,mr leonard was a big time runner in his college days but was unable to learn anything while in college as a result mr leonard was thrown out of college and no other school would take him because even though he was a good runner he wasn't well educated which was not tolerated this is seen as a big incouragement for paul seeing as how he is blossoming into a good athlete and is also slowly getting his education that he can accomplish things when he tries also paul would be motivated to become better jumping and try to learn more to make mr leonard proud of him and possibly accomplish what leonard couldn't
20759,8,2,paul was effected by mr leonard because paul knew how it feel to be embarrassed for example in the story the author stated ' i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i idin't know an answer everyone else knew ' this statement shows paul understood how mr leonard felt therefore paul was effected by mr leonard background
20760,8,1,paul is concerned about mr leonard that why didn't he finish college and why didn't he tell him that he was a star athlete on hurdlers
20761,8,0,paul likes to incourage people to do better
20762,8,2,as long as paul had known mr leonard he was a hall monitor this made paul respectful and obedient to him that not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics the next peice of backround information paul learns about mr leonard is that mr leonard was a track star this simply increases the respect he has for him in the story paul didn't appear to be upset that mr leonard hadn't told him about his past he treated him the same but seemed to appriciate him more the last peice of information paul learned about mr leonard was that he couldn't read many kids would simply make fun if an adult was illiterate but paul can simpathize he understands how difficult it can be to learn to read and embraces and helps mr leonard to read
20763,8,1,during this story paul learns backround information about mr leonard that really surprises him this information shows paul that even though you may be good at something for example a sport school work and your education always comes first now paul will really work hard on learning how to read he doesn't want to let mr leonard or himself down
20764,8,0,the background information has a huge affect on paul because mr leonard was trying to help paul be as good as he was at hurdles mr leonard wanted someone that never did anything and was working hard for his grades when mr leonard found out that paul was learning how to read mr leonard took that as an oppurtunity to help paul achieve in something that he once had
20765,8,1,paul doesn't feel as embarrased to know his coach struggled with reading too
20766,8,2,paul was curious as to why mr leonard had never mentioned of his running past he seemed proud of him that he had accomplished something so great and had something to his name when paul found out the reasoning that mr leonard had for what happened he felt for him paul knew exactly how mr leonard felt the embarrasment the lack of knowledge while everyone else had the answer he could truly relate to him it occured to paul that in the same way mr leonard had approached him and helped him out with athletics and doing something for himself he was gonna help mr leonard do the same paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills and while helping him it would also improve paul's reading skills
20767,8,2,when paul realizes that his everyday coach and hall monitor was truely a great college track runner paul was stunned paul had been interacting with mr leaonard everyday without knowing his true background paul is surprised about mr leonard's background and then goes on to ask him various questions
20768,8,2,the background information that paul finds about mr leonard gives him a curious feeling he wondered what happened to mr leonard as it turns out mr leonard can't read which is the same problem that paul had which caused the two to meet since mr leonard taught paul how to run hurdles paul felt he should teach mr leonard how to read
20769,8,1,the effect on paul from raeding mrs leonard explains that paul can do anything you want as long as you have the knoweledge and the education because you can be good at anything but if you dont have no education what can you do with out it
20770,8,2,he it makes him like mr leonard more when he finds out that he was a track star and very good he shows the coach more understanding as to why he made him do track when he learns that mr leonard cant read he becaomes more sympathetic towards him
20771,8,1,it has a positive effect on paul it makes him want to strive to be better than mr leonard
20772,8,1,the information he fount on mr leonard had a good effect on paul because he didnt know mr leonard ran track in his freshmen year in college he was inspired by it and the fact that mr leonard was inspiring him to run track and to have his education
20773,8,2,paul feels a relation between himself and mr leonard they both can't or have trouble reading plus they are both track hurdlers too therefore when he paul learns of mr leonard's past he feels a relation between them
20774,8,0,he isn't really affected by it he was just curious as to why mr leonard didn't tell him about it paul may have been a little hurt but i don't think it really surprised him that much paul was understanding when mr leonard told him why and wanted to help him
20775,8,1,paul is very impressed about what he hears about mr leonard the next day he asks him why he never told paul that he was such a good college hurdler paul wondered why he didnt continue to run after college since he was so talented and mr leonard told him it was because his grades were too bad and no college wanted a runner that couldnt read so they took his scholarship away
20776,8,0,mr leonard did a great job when he was on track but became very discouraged after attending a college and not knowing how to read he later dropped out because no college wanted a athlete that wasnt able to read he explained his past to the narrator to show him that he should never give up and he did that by encouraging the narrator that he is very lucky to be at a school that is willing to offer certain programs
20777,8,2,paul finds out about mr leonard's past from the high school track coach he is surprised by the janitor's previous experiences you know that he surprised because he confronts him about it when he finds out grabowski can not read he feels the need to help he shows that by tellinghim it is time to start training you
20778,8,2,it surprises him but he is more determined to help mr leonard and do better himself paul sees the person that helped him not do so well in school so it would shock and surprise him he is more determined to help mr leonard out since mr leonard helped him out he knows what mr leonard feels like since he has gone through some of the same situations
20779,8,1,pauls more aprehensive to learn hes confident that learning to read will be easier now because if tracks easy then so is school and it theres people like him then hes not so ashamed
20780,8,2,paul was honored to be trained by a college athlete when he found out that mr leonard also couldn't read he understood how his coach felt he also felt that he owed mr leonard something for teaching him how to run hurdles so he offered to help the coach with reading
20781,8,0,paul wants to learn how to run faster for the high school track and he run every day with mr leonard and mr leonard wants to lit him tran for high school because he will be good and faster they another kis mr leonard shows the boy something how to stay and shape
20782,8,0,paul could be good at sport than mr leonard
20783,8,1,when paul does a background check on mr leonard he realizes that mr leonard was the same way he was back in school he wants to make something of himself instead of being a hall monitor in a middle school someday
20784,8,2,i believe that when paul knows the truth about mr leonard he is more motivated to start learning and willing to work harder on hurdling his relationship with mr leonard also increases and he comes to respect him
20785,8,0,well mr leonard was paul teacher and everybody would always make fun of him because he wasnt good at sports or anything so his teacher decides to put me in sports like basketball and track he would like jump over the hurdles like it wasnt nothing and his coach was like nice job kid i hope you do good when your playing baskaetball so he lefted english to go to a learning center to get helped and work out for the basketball and track and everybody that was in the school were like good job kid im proud of you so then the kids were jealous and mad because he would do something right that his coach would tell me
20786,8,0,the background information helps paul acheive his goals paul took his training lessons from mr leonard and became good at doing the hurdles in track even though paul couldn't read he still wanted to do few things to accomplish in his life he may of been going into the learning center but that doesn't stop you from doing well in other acheivements paul learned alot from his coach and taught him how to be better than what paul had realized he was
20787,8,2,the background that mr leonard gives paul makes paul think that they are the same because they both can't read mr leonard and paul are both good at hurddles
20788,8,1,paul was surprised and kind of angry that mr leonard didnt tell him sooner
20789,8,2,the narrator is surprised at the information he never expected that mr leonard was a track star
20790,8,1,the background information that paul finds out helps paul know that he can become an athlete too it also proves that paul can go to college even though he can't read mr leonard went to college and was a good athlete even though he couldn't read
20791,8,0,when paul recieved the background information he had questions for mr leonard paul wondered
20792,8,2,because paul learned that mr leonard had been a great athlete but flunked out of school because he was unable to read he had common ground built with mr leonard that knowledge of what had happened to mr leonard impacted paul to start working harder because mr leonard had told him how hard things got after high school
20793,8,2,mr lenorad lets paul know he was flunked out of college for not being able to read this effects paul because he is in the same situation at school because he cant read as well but mr leonards lets him know thats not a problem because paul has help that mr leonard didnt have
20794,8,2,paul comes to find out that mr leonard and himself are the same they both struggle with reading in high school and in high school is when they found that they love track
20795,8,0,paul can't believe that mr leonard was a college tract runner he wants to know why mr leonard didn t tell him
20796,8,2,during the story when paul confronts mr leonard about his past it becomes apparent that the two are more alike than they had anticipated mr leonard too could not read the embarassing emotions that mr leonard felt were all too familiar to paul and gave him a sense of not being alone the effect that this information had on paul was substantial because it motivated paul to become a better reader and athlete not just for his sake but for mr leonard's sake as well
20797,8,2,teh background information on mr leonard effects paul by making him realize that other people also share his troubles of not being able to read even great athletes like mr leonard

20799,8,0,he wants him to be as good as he can be for the sport that he is going out for and learn as much as he can to be prepared for what he is about to get into he is going out for training to get as good as he can at it
20800,8,2,when paul learns of mr loenard's past it might have had a positive emotional affect on himself paul says in the story that he is a select few who are in the remedial reading program and from this he may feel embarrased and have low self esteem plus when talking about how he is picked last in sports doesn't help his esteem either but when learns of mr leonard who had success in something even though he struggled in school this may motivate paul to want to excel at both the hurdles and in school and do what mr leonard could not accomplish
20801,8,1,paul realizes mr leonard and him are similiar paul realizes he doesn't have to be the last person picked in the gym anymore and he can achieve something and there is hope that he will learn to read and become a great athlete
20802,8,0,he realizes that even if he is not good in school he can still succeed in life he finds that he just has to find something he is good at stick with it and succeed
20803,8,2,the effect that it has on paul is that he now feels the desire to help out mr leonard since he had takent the time to help him out in the story it says 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him ' this show how he felt the need to return the help
20804,8,0,leonardo was a hall monitor and he keeped the crowed moving at all times he never gave up paul learned alot from him and he used that in life
20805,8,2,mr leonards background information gives paul hope in knowing that he can actually great at something since he doesnt know how to read it also builds up his confidence in learning how to read since mr leonard never learned due to the lacking of a learning center when he was in school when paul realizes how much mr leonard and him have in common it makes him feel alot better that there is someone out there that can relate to him and his problems in life mr leonard never learned to read and depended on friends to help him get by even though it was hard he got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run he soon realized that the work was alot harded there then it was in high school and eventually flunked out and lost his scholorship no college would take him after that because they did'nt want a runner that could'nt read
20806,8,0,he noticed that he came from being a very good track coach in a different state
20807,8,2,paul found out that mr leonard had starred in college track he broke the college freshman record for the 400 meter hurdles however he found out that mr leonard had flunked out of college paul realized how lucky he was to be getting help in reading at the learning center mr leonard's school had not had a learning center so he never got help with his reading problems he had great potential in athletics but never got to realize it because of his learning problems this makes paul appreciate his tutoring
20808,8,2,when paul realizes that mr leonard was a good runner but bad reader he realizes they are alike it makes paul want to help mr leonard by teaching him to read and it makes mr leonard to help paul feel accepted by helping him with track it also motivates paul to do better in school so he won't end up flunking
20809,8,1,mr leonard's background information had an effect on paul because both mr leonard and paul had the same problem and motivation their problem was that both were not very strong at reading but their strengths hurdles is what brought the two together as friends since mr leonard had the motivation to teach paul hurdles and paul was willing to learn paul could become the new mr leonard athletically
20810,8,2,he learns that mr leonard is very much like him in the sense that mr leonard isn't a good reader either when mr leonard explains to paul about how he was a good enough athlete to get a scholarship for running track even though he was not that good in school when he explained to paul that he began letting his lack of knowledge in school effect his persuit of being a runner in college it helped paul realize that he could be good at something to balance out his toubles in school but he must still work hard in school to fully accomplish a goal with mr leonard showing paul how they have a common problem with school and a common interest in jumping the hurdles paul was able to apply mr leonard's advice to his own life
20811,8,2,the effect of the background information on paul is a good thing the background information makes paul open his eyes and realize what mr leonard was doing for him mr leonard did not know how to read and when he found out that paul did not know how to read he eased up on him mr leonard coaches paul how to do hurdles mr leonard sees himself in paul and knows it is a great thing for him
20812,8,0,when paul recieves background information about mr leonard they become more familiar with eachother paul has an inferrior and shy complex as he first interacts with mr leonard he obeys the comands form his hall monitor but there was no relationship formed when mr leonard introduces himself as a concerned adult paul still looks up to him after a relationship is formed with common character traits and the two characters become on the same level of understanding
20813,8,0,paul receives information about mr leonard after training with him for some time after receiving the information however paul now understands why mr leonard wants to help him mr leonard inspires him to do his best he sees that having the learning center and trying hard along with doing sports is a hard task to accomplish he wants to overcome this task though
20814,8,2,paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star as a college freshman however because mr leonard struggled with reading and academics he lost his scholarship and was forced to drop out of school the fact that mr leonard also struggles academically helps paul to relate to him it gives paul the confidence to embark on a friendship where he and mr leanard can help each other succeed
20815,8,1,over the course of paul's encounters with mr leonard various pieces of information are picked up about the former runner its is first revealed that he is has empathy for those struggling in thier lives when he offers to help paul jump the hurdle in paragraphs 14 23 'know what that right' i panted' the greatest revealation however is made when paul obtains information on mr leonard from his coach in paragraphs 32 33 ' 'visit this site with the team' this makes paul aware of the strengths and weaknesses that other people have and how to symphathize with whatever difficulties they experience in their weaknesses
20816,8,2,paul gets backgroung information abuot mr leonard and effects paul because he didn't know that leonard was a hurdle athlete he said he couldn't read and that he flunked college because of it leonard got all emotional and paul knew how he felt so he said 'c'mon mr leonard ' 'it's time to start your training ' paul wanted to help mr leonard and make him feel better
20817,8,1,paul realizes that mr leonard was just like him and he acomplished something great it inspires him by showing him that you can accomplish many things even if you aren't great at others
20818,8,1,paul finds the background information very interresting to him paul seems to feel for mr leonard paul works hard to and gets help after school also going to the learning center for help mr leonard tells him how diffrent it was for him back when he was here pauls age they didnt have a learning center for him mr leonard had to go to his friends for help this showed paul that he can do it if mr leonard did he will just have to work hard at school work and track
20819,8,1,the background information helps paul understand why mr leonard wanted him to try the hurdles and do well in the remedial reading program paul is then very empathetic toward mr leonard and is probably going to try teach him
20820,8,2,the background information about mr leonard has an astronomical effect on paul paul found a new form of respect for mr leonard after reading the background information which can be infered by paul's astonishment of mr leonard's accomplishments paul now looks up to mr leonard as an idol for jumping hurtles when paul learns of mr leonards disability he wants to help mr leonard in the same way that mr leonard helped him
20821,8,2,the backround check on mr leonard was very suprising to paul he didnt know that he was a track star at hurdles paul went to his computer and went to the schools track and feild website and looked at the history about hurdles and he saw mr leonard name and it said that he got a full time scholorship for college for hurdles
20822,8,2,paul did not feel as alone after he discovered that mr leonard had a reading problem in school paul was also surprised that mr leonard used to be such a fantastic athlete and wondered why he kept this information from him
20823,8,1,it was explaining that he was a well talented person who wanted to help another out with his talent when he wasn't doing good in school he was being helped by some tutors that was willing to help him so that he can keep his tallent going
20824,8,1,mr leonard's background information effects paul paul realizes he could be like mr leonard because neither of them ccan read proficently mr leonard's background information helps paul understand that he is not the only one that cannot read and paul learns that he can excell at other things such as track and field
20825,8,1,once paul hears why mr leonard college story he wanted to help him learn to read becuse mr leonard was going to help him get in shape
20826,8,0,as the reader you learn that mr leonard was once a great track star when he was in highschool knowing this you can see why he wants to help out the young boy in the story then you also learn that he cannot read that well and that he flunked out of collage knowing this you can learn more about mr leonard in the fact that he is embarrased with himself and doesnt want the same for the kid
20827,8,1,the effect it has on paul is that he was surprised that the monitor was almost something in life but crushed because of something important he felt lied too just a little bit
20828,8,2,the background information about mr leonard is that he had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals in college what is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership why was because he didn't know how to read
20829,8,0,that he was a good athlete but not a good student mr leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals
20830,8,2,that paul went to try how hurlding and mr leonard said to come on back tomorrow mr leonard was a former track star so paul wanted to try it for him self because mr leonard was a good college track star but mr leonard could not read and lost his schlorships and flunked college so i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track
20831,8,2,paul is affected by the information he finds out about mr leonard in many way for starters paul is somewhat astonished to find that like him mr leonard can't read paul realizes how lucky he is to have the learning center to help him learn to read also paul can sympatize with mr leonard which will make their relationship stronger
20832,8,2,the effect mr leonard's background information has on paul is that paul now feels more connected to him 'i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer anyone else knew ' this quote from the story shows that paul can relate to mr leonard and that it has brought them closer together paul also felt the need to help mr leonard with reading as he had helped paul with track and field from this quote 'this man had given his time to help me excel at someting suddenly i realized what i could do for him '
20833,8,0,he realizes that he is the same way when it comes to school he realizes also that he doesnt need to be booksmart to do things in life
20834,8,2,paul did not know that mr leonard did not know how to read now he feels bad and wants to help him learn to read
20835,8,0,it makes paul a better student and after he hears the story from mr leonard he works even harder and try's harder so that he doesnt let that happen to him
20836,8,2,the eefect the background information that paul found on mr leonard was suprising to him that he was a trck star but yet whe he found out that he couldn't read he felt simpathy for him because in paragraph 45 and 46 he knows the embarassement that he feels of not knowing how to read and figures he can probiabily teach hi how to read
20837,8,0,that why would he be teaching him how to run the hurdles if he was so good and also to ask him why he is the hall monitor for the school not a track star person
20838,8,2,paul realizes that he and mr leonard have even more in common than he may have originally thought when paul discovers that mr leonard was a college track star paul becomes more motivated this is shown when he asks whether or not he should work out with the team when paul soon discovered that mr leonard can't read and flunked out of college he is motivated to begin mr leonard's 'training '
20839,8,0,the background information paul discover schanges his outlook on mr leonard it pushes him to succeed and show mr leonard how great he can really be
20840,8,0,the effect it has on paul was that it made him curious to know why mr leonard didn't tell him about it and why he quit
20841,8,2,it has a huge effect on paul and mr leonard when he first shows mr leonard the url it makes a big impact on him because paul now knows that he was a major track athlete only knowing that he coudnt finish college because he started flunking and not being able to know how to read once mr leonard told paul that that gave him the motivations to try to be better at the track and to not give up since it reminds him of paul since he coudnt read and he had to go to the learning center twice a week from school
20842,8,2,paul could relate to what mr leonard went through paul knew how it felt to not be able to read and knew also how it felt to overcome that obstacle this is shown when it says 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me ' the learned information also shows paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative he not only overcomes his inability to read but finds an outlet and takes leadership in both in running track he gets on the high school team and in reading is able to help mr leonard learn as well
20843,8,2,the information he learned gave him comfidence to help mr leonard just as mr leonard helped him paul tells mr leonard it is time to start training meaning its time to start learning paul also now could relate to mr leonard better
20844,8,0,during the story paul gets some backround information about mr leonard paul learns that mr leonard broke records and was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals paul learns mr leonard was an outstanding athlete but not a good student as the story continues paul learns that mr leonard could not read and then flunked out of school mr leonard was very dissappointed in himself and embarassed
20845,8,0,the background information that they had on him was things about when he was in college and he had bad grades and he couldn't go out for scouts
20846,8,2,paul was suprized that mr leonard never told him about his past 'why didn't you tell me about this ' he also seemed amazed by everything that mr leonard had done 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the natuinals you broke records '
20847,8,2,the background information paul finds on mr leonard has him feeling both appreciative and sympathetic paul feels good because he has been coached by a great national winning hurdler also paul felt good about himself because he was asked to pratice with the track team and he was always bad at sports on the other hand paul was sympathetic for mr leonard for what had happened to him for example paul asked ' well what happened after that ' that shows he was curious and cared
20848,8,1,the background infromation shows paul that he can learn how to read that if he puts his mind to something he can succsed if he tries
20849,8,1,its the fact that they both cant read
20850,8,2,paul finds out that mr leonard was an old track runner and that he broke many records when paul confronts him he finds out mr leonard cant read like himself
20851,8,2,the background information has an effect of paul because he gets to know a person better and is therefore not the only one who can't read and feels better
20852,8,2,after paul researched the background information about mr leonard he becomes exstatic and excited to be in the precence of a leagend this is evident when paul asked why mr leonard had not told him about his acomplishments this is also evident from the excited way the say that 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nations you broke records '
20853,8,1,there is a simlairies that mr leonard shaw potential in paul and wanted paul to suceed in life ad to be motivated to read so paul wouldnt end up like mr leonard
20854,8,2,the background information paul found about mr leonard made him empathetic because he knew exactly how he felt but also he became motiveated to help mr leonard just as he had helped him with hurdles 'suddenly i realized what i could do for him '
20855,8,0,paul was asked to gym
20856,8,1,seeing that mr leonard had been capable of not only going to college but braking records in the 400 meter hurdles influenced him paul seen that mr leonard accomplished amazing things in life and then come to find out he flunked out of college because he couldn't read influenced paul even more paul was improving more and more each week at running hurdles so that made him work even harder at becoming a better reader knowing mr leonard had flunked out of college because he couldn't read
20857,8,1,the narrator is in a way just like mr leonard he will want to get better at reading and stay in school so he can go on with track through college
20858,8,2,paul was surprised to see that the hall monitor mr leonard had been an exceptional collegiate athlete he also wondered why he doesn't run anymore so he went to confront mr leonard about it and asked 'well what happened after that ' and he said ' i lost my scholarship and flunked '
20859,8,2,the background information of mr leonard effects paul in a positive way when paul finds out the mr leonard was also a great hurdler but flunked out of college for not being able to read it shows him that he can overcome even the biggest obstacles paul is a little shocked when mr leonard says that he was a hurdler in college but could not read paul shows this in paragraph 43 paul could relate to what mr leonard went through and he ends up helping mr leonard learn to read
20860,8,2,paul receives a url containing information about mr leonard's past as a track star this shocked paul at first and made him wonder why mr leonard kept this from him he then realized that mr leonard was unable to read just like himself this made paul feel like he isn't such a failure at life after all because he is now good at track and field as well as has the ability to use a learning center to learn how to read
20861,8,0,it gives you backround information so you can get to understand the characters more to really feel the strory without some back round information it can make a story hard to follow
20862,8,2,paul found out that mr leonard was a very good hurdler mr leonard ran 400 meter hurdles at nationals mr leonard even broke records when mr leonard told paul that he flunked out and lost his scholarship paul got pushed to try harder at hurdles and reading
20863,8,2,paul is affected in that learing mr leonards background has made him more determined to work hard on reading and the new sport he is in this also gave him better understanding of mr leonard's life so he does not feel like his reading problem is such a rareity and paul has decided to help him with his reading the same way mr leonard helped him with hurrdles
20864,8,2,an example from the story that tells paul some background information about mr leonard is when paul gets on the track and field website thats says mr leonard was a college track star it surprises paul and also lets him know mr leonard was a good runner also it inspires paul to continue track and even become an even better athelete
20865,8,2,paul is surprised about the background information he was surprised he won 400 meters at nationals and broke the records he wants to know more about him
20866,8,0,the information that mr leonard provides has a great effect on paul as he is telling paul about his past it reminds him of himself because he is the same way and wants to change his ways and bcome an achiever in life he also wants to make mr leonard happy by doing track and field
20867,8,2,when mr leonard explained to paul that he had also struggled in life with reading disablities then paul relized that he was suffering the same thing and why he has to go to the learning center to learn how to read mr leonard didn't have much of a way to learn how to read in school he had no learning centers but in collage he had tutors that ried to help him but the collage was to hard so he dropped out when told that to paul the young man noticed that it sounded just like him
20868,8,2,i think this affected paul becuase he thought he was just a gym teacher little did paul know but mr leonard was a start track runner this background information that paul gets helps him understand why mr leonard is helping him this also makes him want to help with his reading problems at the end of the story paul wants to teach mr leonard how to read
20869,8,2,the effect it has on paul is he has a better understanding of mr leonard because he finds out he can't read either so he can understand how mr leonard feels
20870,8,2,paul feels like since mr lenard has helped him become a track and field runner he should help mr lenard learn how to read paul does this by saying that mr lenard has some training to do paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on mr lenard he was also empathetic for mr lenard he wanted to help mr lenard like mr lenard helped him
20871,8,2,paul related better to mr leonard after he found out that mr leonard wasn't very good at reading either
20872,8,2,the backround story you get on mr leonard is that he was a good athlete but he was not a good student college scouts told mr leonard that his grades didn't matter and that they would have tutors for him but since he never did his own work and always had his friends help him during high school he could not handle the more difficult college work this caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship paul could relate to mr leonard's emotions because he too had difficulties wtih school work at the end of the stroy paul tells mr leonard its time for him to start his training this implys that since mr leonard has helped paul with his running that paul will help mr leonard to learn to read
20873,8,1,the effect that the background of mr leonard has on paul is the they are almost alike
20874,8,2,paul is affected by the background information because he is able to empathize with mr leonard about reading difficulties he also most likely understands that had he been born in an earlier age he may have had the same college experience as mr leonard paul is also influenced by the background information to help mr leonard 'train' in reading which is paul's way of showing gratitude and appreciation for mr leonard's efforts to train paul in track and field
20875,8,2,mr leonard's background information had a large effect on paul mr leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals but flunked out of college because he could not read and the school work was too challenging no school would take a runner who couldn't read after paul learned all of this information he felt empathy for mr leonard paul had walked in his shoes somewhat he knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or did not know an answer paul was very grateful and shocked that mr leonard gave up his time to help paul succeed and he wants to repay him now for all his help and dedication
20876,8,1,that anyone can be good at something but sometimes a little trouble can ruin everything just speaking about mr leonards grades he was a good runner just not a good student paul is oustanded by it so it encourages him to do good in school and on the track to show mr leonard he can do it
20877,8,0,the effect it had on paul was that basically he could be a great athlete but he would have to have his grades right also he was a college freshmen who won the 40 meter hurdkes at nationals but he couldnt read
20878,8,2,learning that mr leonard had trouble reading as well my paul feel less alone in the fact he has trouble with reading and schol before he felt stupid when he was called on to read in class or to answer a question he didn't know the answer to and everyone else did now he realizes he isn't alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident
20879,8,1,paul was shocked he did not know what to think
20880,8,2,when he learns that mr leonard was a track star paul is slightly unhappy that he wasn't told he even asks mr leonard why he didn't tell paul he then feels like mr leonard is a kindred spirit when he says 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me ' he feels empathy for mr leonard and that makes paul want to help him at the end of the story
20881,8,2,at first he admires mr leonard he saw that he had been a very talented athlete and he wonders why he never told him about it when paul finds out mr leonard can't read he becomes sympathetic and wants to help him just as mr leonard helped paul with the hurldes
20882,8,1,the effect of mr leonard's background on paul is great paul can connect himself to mr leonard because their backgrounds are similar
20883,8,2,finding out about mr leonard's past helps paul in realizing that he can do things he didn't know he could do seeing what happened to mr leonard helped paul fight through challenges in the end paul says 'c'mon mr leonard it's time to start your training '
20884,8,1,the effect the background information has on paul about mr leonard in the story is that paul has the same problems paul had but paul is getting help with it and paul never was interested in sports but mr leonard was and he was good at them too so since mr leonard helped paul paul would help him
20885,8,2,the effect it has on paul is that he's going throught the same things as mr leonard went through for example when mr leonard was in high school he could read either and he relied on his friends for the work that was givin but as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability paul refers to this because he can't read either all in all mr leonard wants paul to succeed unlike he did mr leonard wants paul to do his best and do better then he did
20886,8,1,paul begins to feel bad for mr leonard and sees that they are similar and so many different ways they both are not the best at reading but they both try to become better at it just as they try to become better athletes
20887,8,0,paul finds background information on mr leonard from the website paul pulled the printout of mr leonard when he used to run mr leonard then smiled sadly the effect makes the reader wonder why mr leonard is sad and makes paul wonder why mr leonard didn't tell him about this before
20888,8,2,when paul found out background information about mr leonard he was surprised since he found out that mr leonard was a great athlete but not a good student he felt good for learning to read since mr leonard said colleges did not want a runner who could not read he flunked out paul apperciated the fact that he knows how to read by knowing this fact about mr leonard
20889,8,1,paul feels sorry for mr leonard because he understands and can relate to how he feels mr leonard's past of 'feelings of embarrassment ' were paul's present life
20890,8,0,paul was a guy who felt neglected and was always picked last and mr leonard picked up on it he knows what it is like to feel embarrassed to not be able to do something because he flunked out of college he motivated paul to do hurdles and showed him how they are obstacles in life he also found that he was not good at reading either so he was concerned and wanted to help
20891,8,0,the stouy was about paul whns to be the beast
20892,8,0,the effect after paul figured out about mr leonard's past was really good for him because mr leonard had the same probolems with reading and his grades but back then it didnt matter what your grades were it was showing paul that if he put his mind to it and tried hard he could acomplish anything he set his mind to
20893,8,2,paul is amazed at the achievments of mr leonard and is curious as to why he did not pursue his talent in line 40 paul asks 'well what happened after that ' this shows that at the time paul didnt understand why mr leonard didn't pursue track and field afterwards paul finds out that mr leonard is illiterate he becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle
20894,8,2,the effect that the background information on mr leonard had on paul was he wanted to help he was confused on what happened since mr leonard was a good athlete who broke records doing 400 meter hurdles in college as a freshman mr leondard told him that he was a good athlete but not a good student he could not read and paul wanted to help he wanted to return the favor and train him and to help him read because mr leonard first trained him on the hurdles and it motivated him to know he can do anything and that it just takes training
20895,8,0,it didn't occured to the narrator at first when mr leonard asked him for his name but later the narrator realized that it was an odd question because mr leonard checked the narrator's hall pass which had his name on it twice every week later the narrator found some information about mr leonard as a track player in college the narrator was curious about what had happened to mr leonard after his broken record as a college freshman mr leonard sheeplishly told the narrator that he flunked out the college because he couldn't read very well then the narrator realized that mr leonard asked for his name because he couldn't read the narrator's hall pass
20896,8,2,the information that paul gets is really familiar to him he is used to the embarrassment of not being able to read just like mr leonard is in paragraph 45 paul starts to change his mind about mr leonard
20897,8,0,it makes paul want to know what happened and why he hadn't told him i think paul might have been upset because he had trust in him
20898,8,2,when paul finds out that mr leonard was once a track star he was shocked to find out why he stoped doin track it was becuase he was a bad student and dosent want paul to be one so hes helping him out
20899,8,2,during the story the reader gets background information about mr leonard the effect the background information has on paul encourages paul to continue to practice track and field and to try his hardest in school aftering hearing about mr leonard's experience of being a freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals and who had broke records and asking what had happened effected paul the most also after hearing that mr leonard had fluncked out of college after his freshman year because he had to rely on his friends to get him through school it encouraged paul to study his hardest and in his tutoring class so that he could be a track allstar some day in college but to be able to handle the rigorous school work that comes with college
20900,8,1,the effect that the reader paul gets when he finds out background information about mr leonard is that he is suprised that mr leonard never mentioned anything about the authors shows that he is suprised because the passage say that paul askes him why didn't he ever tell him anything about it
20901,8,0,i distinguished myself from the masses by being one of a select few in the remedial reading prgram
20902,8,1,after paul finds out what mr leonard went through about flunking out of college having everyone having to help him in school and barley passing by getting a tutor and no other school wants them to run for them because he cant read paul realizes that he can relate to him and he feels the same way it effects with his feeling becasue he feels embarrassed when hes called upon to read infrotn of other people but then he realized that he is going to work as hard as he can for mr leonard
20903,8,0,the information about mr leonard being a top athlete as a freshman in college and setting records explains to paul why he is such a good coach to him on the track but later found information about mr leonard losing his scholarship and flunking out of college explains why mr leonard is so suspicious about why paul goes to the learning center
20904,8,1,the background information inspires paul to do better because when mr leonard tell paul about his situation paul symisizes when him because he is in the same position
20905,8,1,the background information showed paul why mr leonard was helping him train for track also mr leonard's past related to what paul is going through
20906,8,2,when paul finds out that mr leonard went to college on a track schollarship but then failed out because he too could not read connects paul to his coach more paul realizes that he is not the only one who struggles with something and that he can accomplish great things in paragraph 45 paul explains how he knows and understands how his coach felt he now knows what he can do to help his coach as well
20907,8,0,paul seems up for a challenge and is ready to start something with leonard he seems thrilled and excited to join this track team with leaonard and be against him
20908,8,2,the effect that the backround information had on paul was exciting he finds it very surprising that mr leonard was such a remarkable athlete he says ' you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdels at the nationals you broke records '
20909,8,2,the effect was that he felt a great deal of respect and awe toward mr leonard probably because he was surprised to know that the janitor was such a good hurtler it made him feel kind of good to know that mr leonard was a hurtler adn that mr leonard was spending time teaching him how to do this but then upon learning that mr leonard couldn't read it probably made paul feel kind of awed toward mr leonard because he was like him in those ways
20910,8,1,paul realizes that mr leonard is like him becasue he can't read and is really good at track mr leonard does not want paul to not be able to read and be good at track he want paul to be able to read and be good at track
20911,8,2,the background information about mr leonard is suprising to paul paul wonders why mr leonard didn't continue in track and field after that race he finds that mr leonard is a lot like him and he wants to help him learn how to read just like he helped paul how to run hurdles
20912,8,2,the reader has a normal life with no extra activities and mr leonard chanes that by teaching him how to hurdle when the reader finds out why mr leonard left college is when he actually connects with mr leonard and wants train him in reading
20913,8,0,because he was a college drop out
20914,8,1,the information gave paul enthusiasm to do good because his coach did good to
20915,8,1,paul feels imapthectic twords mr lenord her fells that they are one in the same because of him sharing
20916,8,2,it shows paul that mr leonard was the same as paul he didin't know how to read and he was only good at track when paul learns he can't read he extends the favor back and decides he is going to teach mr leonard how to read just like he taught him how to jump hurdles
20917,8,2,once paul receives the information about mr leonard he is encouraged almost dumbfounded paul is shocked because he can't believe the subtleness of the hall monitor that he meets was a former record breaker paul is proud of mr leonard but also confused as to why mr leonard did not go onto bigger and better things paul states 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records ' paragraph 38 he continues to ask 'well what happened after that ' paragraph 40 this show paul's intent on finding out why mr leonard did not move onto bigger and better things
20918,8,2,the background information that paul learned about mr leonard i think has made paul not be ashamed that he is getting help mr leonard told paul 'i relied on friends to help me get by but even then the work was always too hard ' this shows paul that he should get help with things now so that in the future he won't rely on other people like friends to get him by in college and learn how to take on responsiblities before he gets into college and flunks out
20919,8,1,it shows that even though he is good at a sport he still has to work hard to keep his grades up that he should always try his best and to try different things
20920,8,1,paul is shocked to hear that mr leonard was in track an never told anyone
20921,8,1,the background information helped paul see why its important to try in school it also got him motivated to want to go in track
20922,8,2,it shows paul that school is important there are other people that can not read either like mr leonard
20923,8,2,paul was surprised paul didnt know mr leonard was a freshman in college who ran the 400 meter hirdles and broke records
20924,8,2,mr leonard is very much like paul he was once a young boy and possesses some of the same problems that paul seems to have as a young child mr leonard had distractions and difficulties learning to this day as he is telling the story to paul he is still unable to read it is obvious that mr leonard wants to help paul and show him that he can pass school if only he works hard to overcome his obstacles 'i lost my scholarship and flunked out ' mr leonard stated paul could see how embarassed the man was to share that but it only made paul want to try harder to acheive his grades and go to college
20925,8,0,when paul is in school and he has gym class he is usually always the one thats picked last when it comes to games and sports he wants to learn how to do a sport good so he doesn't have to be picked last in everything
20926,8,2,during the story the reader understands that paul has a hard time reading when he meets mr leonard paul becomes motivated by him by going out for track paul finds out that mr leonard was once a renowned tack star but failed to stay in school because of his grades paul becomes inspired to succeed in school and track for mr leonard the last paragraph paul remembers what mr leonard did for him and wants to help mr leonard with his reading
20927,8,1,the effect that the background information has on paul is that it encourages him to teach mr leonard how to read
20928,8,2,the effect of the background of mr loenard has the effect that he was just like him when he felt embarrased about reading and could not and mr leonard could not read which made him emarased to tell of why he cant which was because of his background
20929,8,0,the backround information given to paul was used to help mr leonard with his reading
20930,8,1,he was surprised when he found out that mr leonard was a high school track star
20931,8,1,paul probably feels motivated because he isn't the only one who doesn't know how to read this motivates him to hurdle
20932,8,1,paul is suprised that mr leonard didn't tell him about how he ran track in high school
20933,8,2,paul had the same problem as mr leonard they both couldnt read but the difference paul had a reading program to go and mr leonard didnt so paul sees the similaritys between mr leonard and him with reading
20934,8,2,when paul learns that mr leonard run track in college and boke some records he realizes how he know so much about track and understands why he is helping him once he is told about how he flunked out of college paul relize that he can help mr leonard to so he returns the favor and helps him with what he struggled with in school
20935,8,2,the background information about mr leonard effects paul because it was surprising that a janitor was a star athlete in college paul is overwhelmed because mr leonard broke records and won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals
20936,8,2,paul understood where mr leonard was coming from he also realized they were similar mr leonard helped paul train for hurtles and paul decided he could give something in return by teaching mr leonard to read
20937,8,0,during the story paul is given a website to look at while looking at the website her found out a little history on mr leonard's succes in track and field in the hall paul was stopped by him he was confused when he found out that he did not know pauls name
20938,8,0,mr leonard has background infromation he doesn't want to tell paul because his college sport he played he was disappointed on
20939,8,2,i think that paul noticed how great of person he was he already had respect for mr leonard and did as he was told but once he found out he was a track star in college it helped him realize his possibilities it made paul more confident to find out that a successful man like him could not read as well
20940,8,1,when paul gets background information about mr leonard he is extremely surprised paul doesn't understand why mr leonard hasn't already informed him of his past accomplishments after all that mr leonard recounted to him paul could completely relate to mr leonard paul felt like they had a win win friendship because mr leonard had something to offer him and he had something to offer mr leonard
20941,8,2,the effect it had on paul was somewhat like the effect paul had on mr leonard sympathy they knew how each other felt not knowing how to read 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all to familiar to me i knew them well feeling of embarassment when i ws called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew ' 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him ' paul helped mr leonard just like he had helped paul
20942,8,2,the information effects paul because he finds out that mr leonard is just like him he cant read when the coach gave paul that url and website to search him and he read about mr leonard paul wanted to help him be able to read just like mr leonard is helping him
20943,8,1,paul finally understands why mr leonard is interested in him paul and mr leonard are alike in a way they both have problems reading and are good at track even though mr leonard is a college flunk out paul still feels the same about him if not better
20944,8,0,the effect it has on paul is that he finds out that even his own english teacher had trouble back when he was in high school and he did not want paul to go through the same things that he had to go through
20945,8,0,he wants paul to not be like he was in school and study harder and make it out there and not flunk out and to teach it only takes effort there was no one for him back then now there is pople willing to help him if he asks and trys his best
20946,8,0,mr leonard has kind of the same problems as paul mr lenoard was a good athlete but did poorly in school he relied on friends to help him get by mr leonard had problems with reading and fluked out of college because of it
20947,8,2,'c'mon mr leonard ' i said walking back toward school 'it's time to start your training ' this statement made by paul shows that the background information that was given touched paul emotionally after hearing mr leonard's story paul made a mental connection with him they both couldn't read they had something in common this new connection lead to paul being willing to help mr leonard and allowing them to have a closer friendship and to be more empathetic toward one another
20948,8,2,he underwstands why mr leonard worked with him to do this mr leonard was agood athlete b ut didnt know how to read bc they didnt have help centers
20949,8,0,paul was a good athlete but not a good student he had no learning centes in school o relied on friends to help get him by even thou he worked hard and went to college
20950,8,0,it effects the story in ways that mr leonard was a phenomenom he broke many records and the narator was being trained by a star athlete
20951,8,1,paul feels horrible about what happened to mr leonard paul then feels remorse over the fact mr leonard can't read and then he relates their problems
20952,8,0,that paul didn't really know about sports that well so he didn't know about mr leonard at all which made mr leonard not tell hima bout his past when he was in college
20953,8,1,it encourages him to do his best therefor he goes to the track meets and is going to compete
20954,8,2,the information paul learns on mr leonard makes him wonder and probably think of him as a role model paul had no idea he was an awesome hurtle runner and to find out he got kicked out of college for grades probably makes paul feel like he can help him just like mr leonard helped him with hurtles
20955,8,0,paul reminded mr leonard about his college days paul is one of leonards best hurdlers
20956,8,2,after the realization of mr leonard's past paul wanted to help him paul saw that mr leonard was sad and a little regretful about flunking out of college so he wanted to teach him mr leonard had assisted paul and now paul wanted to assist mr leonard by tutorong him in reading comprehension
20957,8,2,paul and mr loenard both have the same thing in commom they both do not know how to read both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class but after a while of talking to mr leonard paul finds out that he was an amazing track athelete mr leonard teaches paul the lesson of 'nothing is impossible without determination
20958,8,0,the background information that paul learns about mr leonard makes mr leonard feel sad and kind of embarrassed for example 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew'
20959,8,0,in the beginning of the story paul tells the reader that he cannot read when mr leonard tells paul to stay after one day and showed him the basketball team paul tells the reader that he is always the last guy choosen in gym class and doesn't want more of that treatment then when mr leonard tells paul to run paul doesn't disobey because he is just use to doing as he is told throughtout the story with mr leonard's help paul becomes great at track upon finding out that mr leonard cannot read paul decides that is it time to gave back to the man who made him a fast runner
20960,8,2,the effect it has on paul is that mr leonard is just like him except he never learned how to read paul now knows he has a chance to make something of himself because he gets extra help unlike mr leonard
20961,8,2,from the way that paul responded from the information about mr leonard he seemed suprised and kind of anrgy that mr leonard didnt tell him once he explained his reasons for why he didnt tell paul i think paul understood more i think now paul has more of a connection with mr leonard because they have something in common neither of them can read and they are both good at hurdles towards the end of the story it makes them closer
20962,8,0,the effect paul gets from reading about mr leonard's background changes what he thought about him and answered a lot of questions for him after paul knew why he flunked out of college he took mr leonard too the learning center
20963,8,1,the effect it has on paul is that paul can relate to it he knows what it feels like to be embarrassed about not being able to read
20964,8,2,mr leonard was in the same situation that paul was in he is unable to read but is a good at running track it effects paul by making him want to help mr leonard to read which is at the end of the story
20965,8,2,when paul finds out about mr leonards past as a track star who flunked out of college because he couldn't read he saw it as an oppurtunity to help him mr leonard had helped paul become good at track and in return paul said he would help him learn to read
20966,8,0,it gives paul more knowledge on mr leonard it also makes him more confident in letting mr leonard coach him
20967,8,2,the background information about mr leonard motivates paul to help him with something when he questions him and finds out the truth he says 'c'mon mr leonard it's time to start your training '
20968,8,2,all the background information on paul is the same as mr leonard paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with mr leonard mr leonard asked paul 'where do you think you're going ' paul said 'learning center ' mr leonard asked 'why ' paul said 'why ' 'i can't read ' later on in the story paul pulled out a piece of paper and said 'why didn't you tell me about this ' mr leonard said 'i looked good back then didn't i ' paul said 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records ' mr leonard said 'i remember best race of my life ' paul said 'well what happened after that ' mr leonard said 'i was a good athlete but not a good student we had no learning center in our school i relied on friends to help me get by but even then the work was always to hard ' paul said 'but you went to college ' mr leonard said 'things were different back then the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter that i'd have tutors to help me but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read see both paul and mr leonard can't read they are almost alike
20969,8,1,the information about mr leonard came shocking to paul and he noticed his teacher as someone like only a janitor he had no hope in his future and so when he found out about his school janitor he then had the courage to succeed in what he thought was impossible just like mr leonard
20970,8,2,paul is a little touched by the information he finds out about mr leonard paul knows with a lot of effort and continued practice he can be a decent track and feild athlete paul has a reading disablility and works hard in the school's learning center and disovers that mr leonard flunked out of college because of his reading abilities this motivated paul to help mr leonard and to make sure he becomes a better reader
20971,8,2,after paul listend to mr leonard's story about his college experience it opens his eyes and makes him realize what he must do paul wants to pay mr leonard back not with money but with knowledge at the end of the story paul tells mr leonard that 'it's time to start your trainging' meaning its time to learn to read
20972,8,2,it makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read
20973,8,0,the effect that the background information has on paul is that
20974,8,0,because then he knows why he didnt say just come on it wont hurt you another reason is thats why he knows he couldnt read his name on the hall pass also instead of looking at the hall pass he just asked him where he was going the coach just probably looked at it and pretended to read it then at the very end he knows he feels sorry for paul also paul feels sorry for him and tells the coach come on lets go start your training
20975,8,1,the effect the information had on paul about mr leonard was that paul was not the most intelligent kid and neither was mr leonard back in his day paul realized even though you do poor in something doesn't mean you can't still susceed mr leonard wanted to have paul realize that he's not the only one in the situation he's in
20976,8,0,the background check on paul would be about the same as mr leonard becasue he was very good at track and field but he couldn't read he wanted to help paul get better at track and field and much better at reading he wants him to sucess in collage and be great at track and field
20977,8,2,the effect the background information on mr leonard had on paul was sad because he was in the exact situation that he was in mr leonard couldn't read but he was a really good athlete he had lost his scholarship though because he couldn't read paul wanted to help mr leonard like he helped paul because he felt grateful toward him so paul started helping mr leonard learn to read
20978,8,1,paul is kind of affended that mr leonard never told him because he says 'why didn't you tell me about this ' after he found out the whole truth behind the story he had sympathy for mr leonard because paul is in the same struggle and can relate he feels for leonard because he lost his future all because he couldn't do something as simple as read but it also made him realize that he is in a struggle against reading and school too and if he doesn't over come his obstacle his future at hurdles could end like mr leonards or simply never start
20979,8,2,when paul gets the url from the coach to check out mr leonards background he could not believe it this guy was just like paul he won many awards for track but the one disadvantage that he had was he had flunked out of college because he did not know how to read after paul figured out that mr leonard could not read because he had to ask him his name he knew he was going through the same thing paul thought that since mr leonard helped him achieve what he wanted with the track that paul would help him out by getting back into college atleast try to help him find a center that would enable him to become better at what he could not do paul was just helping mr leonard like he helped paul
20980,8,2,when paul discovers that mr leonard can't read he understands mr leonard's feelings about flunking out of college paul also knows why he was asked what his name was even tho mr leonard sees his pass every day it also explains why mr leonard did get suspicious about paul leaving class early since mr leonard helped paul so much he wanted to return the favor and invited mr leonard to his study group
20981,8,2,paul learns that mr leonard never learned hwo to read and paul struggles with that himself and has to have special help while at school he connects with mr leonard as mentioned in paragraph 45 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all to familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud ' and understands who mr leonard feels after learned about mr leonard's history paul looks back on the days that mr leonard helped him with hurdles and decides to help mr leonard learn to read
20982,8,1,the effect that the background information has on paul is that he is suprised at mr leonard's achievements in college and how he is just a hall moniter in school after achieving greatness
20983,8,0,he want's to do better at reading things and mr leonard is trying to get him help him set his goals in life like he did when he found that out he wanted to try to set goals like he did
20984,8,2,at frist paul is pround for mr leonard because he broke records in collage but then when he finds out mr leonard flunked out of collage because he had a hard time reading paul felt sympathic and realized since mr leonard helped him that he could help read better
20985,8,0,it makes paul feel better about himself he feels that way because he realizes that maybe he could actually excel at something that he could actually be good at something and not feel like he is left out paul had no idea that mr leonard was in a way like him i think paul gained some confidence discovering mr leonard's past
20986,8,0,asked him questions every day he stop him in the hall to see his hall pass
20987,8,2,paul never knew that mr leonard was in track he learned that he was good at hurdles and broke records mr leonard then told paul that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read also paul then felt closer to mr leonard and a little bad for him because they didn't have help at his school so paul decided to help him read
20988,8,2,after reading and finding out all he did about mr leonard paul felt that he was no longer alone in feeling left out he had finally found someone who in all reality was just like him as paul talks to mr leonard about what he read and seeing his reaction to the things that were discussed paul decided the best thing to do was to help mr leonard out by helping him learn to read
20989,8,2,paul shows an interest to him and try to help paul understand the situation of mr leonard therefore paul interested in help him our
20990,8,0,mr leonard was once in the same situation as paul was in it makes paul think how far he has gotten and how much help he recieved
20991,8,2,the back ground information on mr leonard reflects on paul because mr leonard was in the same situation as paul paul realizes that mr leonard is empathetic and it motivates him to do good paul feels the same ways at mr leonard an wants to retrn the favore
20992,8,2,when paul learns about mr leonard's past he doesn't get discouraged instead it motivates him to help mr leonard paul wants to help mr leonard like mr leonard helped him in paragragp forty five paul states that he understands the emotions that mr leonard felt and that is why he decides to start training him in reading at the end of the story
20993,8,0,paul is a student that needed help at reading but also he needed a tutor for help to become very good reader and talented at what ever he do
20994,8,2,paul is surprised that mr leonard never told him about when he had ran the hurdles in high school paul asks mr leonard about why he never told him once he finds out why he feels a stronger connection between the two he feels as if he has found a way to give back to mr leonard also we know this because at the end of the story the narrorator says 'c'mon mr leonard it's time to start your training '
20995,8,2,paul discovers the truth about mr leonard and he was familiar with the same feeling and situation when mr leonard first tells paul about what he used to be paul was filled with unbelief until he explained his situation of not being able to read and dropping out of school paul knew those feelings and it motivates him to try harder to be the best he can while training so that he may make mr leonhard proud
20996,8,0,he told him to meet him at 2 30pm then with all the trainning he eneded up telling him that he was in high school and ran track and ended up going to collage and droped out cause the school didnt want some kid that couldnt read
20997,8,1,mr leonard's past had a big effect on paul it incoureges paul to do well in reading and even stars have the same problem he does it helps him not to hold back because if mr leonard can do it he can to just with a differant outcome
20998,8,1,i believe that the background information paul learns shows him that even if you aren't as good in school as others you can still be the best you can be also i think he learned that friendship was the key way to success and since mr leonard helped him with his hurdles that he must help him read so they can both overcome life's challenges
20999,8,1,the information on mr leonard's past had astonished paul however it also helped motivate him to do better he realized the importance of doing something well and the feeling you get when you do it well he also felt a similarity with mr leonard which helped him make the bond stronger
21000,8,2,paul is a lot like mr leonard they both couldn't read but they were really good at hurdles mr leonard got helped with grades but it didn't work it was still to hard for him the only thing he was good at was track mr leonard beat all kinds of records and the 400 meter hurdles but struggle in school paul is the same way when mr leonard found out he paul couldn't read he remembered how it was like being called out in class to read mr leonard deciced to help with hurdles and become good at them so he can fill like he can accomplish anything in his life
21001,8,1,it reminded paul of himself paul said 'i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when ' paul knew the reason why mr leonard tried to help him and encourage him to do well
21002,8,2,the background information makes paul wonder why mr leonard didnt tell him about how he was a big athlete in college he feels that he can relate to mr leonard because he cant read all that well but he is good at track
21003,8,0,he finds out that mr lenoard was a track star and that he held a bunch of records theses are good thigs for paul because he has a coach that knows what he is doing
21004,8,1,as paul learns about mr leonards past he begins to grow a stronger bond with him sseing as he felt his pain
21005,8,2,the background information about mr leonard has a staggering effect on paul paul is astounded that his coach was such an impressive athlete in his prime his first actions are to inquire about his coach's former accomplishments
21006,8,2,i think that paul really relates to mr leonards background information because he couldn't read back when he was a kid and neither can paul that is why mr leonard took paul to do hurdles because it will help him feel more accepted and he will know that he is good at something just like mr leonard
21007,8,2,i think that the information that paul learns about mr leonard makes him respect him more because he knows that he was once a good track star so he thinks that he will be a good coach i also think that paul felt alot more comfortable with mr leonard when he found out that he couldn't read because he felt like he could relate to mr lenord more
21008,8,1,he feels privledged to have such a great successful athlete to be training him how to do the hurdles he wonders why mr leonard didn't tell him why he was so succesful from the beginning when he first started training him i pulled out the printout i'd downloaded the night before from my pocket 'why didn't you tell me about this ' paragraph 35
21009,8,1,the revelation that mr leonard also struggled with schoolwork provided a way to establish a deeper connection to paul when the narrarator states 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well ' he is revealing how he can empathize with mr leonard
21010,8,2,the background infromation the paul learns about mr leonard effects him by showing him that he's not the only one with reading problems and the mr leonard was just like him as a kid it also makes him want to learn more and help mr leonard learn how to read too

21034,8,0,paul finds out that that mr leonard was a track star when he was in high school and got a scholar sship for college but he couldnt read so they had to take him out
21035,8,2,when paul learns of mr leonard's past he becomes sympathetic towards mr leonard's reading difficulties which paul also has this sympathy is expressed when paul tells mr leonard that 'it's time to start his training ' this meaning that paul is trying to help mr leonard overcome his problems
21036,8,2,the background information that the reader recieves about mr leonard is that he used to be a track star in college and that he could not read also that when he was in school he was not a good student and relied on friends to help him knowing this information it had a great effect on paul now that paul knew this he was more determined to excel in school and do well and also find something he likes and excel in that like the hurdles and track

21038,8,1,after learning about mr leonard's past paul seems to be able to identify more with him he seems to feel closer to mr leonard and wants to help him too he also realizes why mr leonard did what he did to help paul

21041,8,0,back when he was in collage he was a track star he wasnt very good in school and counted on his friends to help him with his school work even then the school work was to hard for him he lost his scholarship and flunked out of school
21042,8,0,mr lenonard was a great athlete in track and field in school he had trouble in reading but he got help from a learning place then he went to college and aslo got help
21043,8,2,the background information makes paul puzzled paul did not understand why mr leonard kept his college tack experience a secret when mr leonard told paul that he flunked out of college paul understood why he kept it a secret
21044,8,2,the background information that the reader gets during the stroy effects paul by giving him motivation since mr leonard was a successful track star back when he was in school he felt confidence that he could teach paul how to be a successful runner as well throughout the story this confidence in paul helps motivate him to train and listen to mr leonard
21045,8,1,after mr lenonard told his story to paul paul realized that acdemic learning is more important than sports he has to participate in his school work because no matter how good mr lenorad was his college still lost his scholarship and flunkes out it is important to learn in schools
21046,8,1,the effect of mr leonard background information doesn't bother paul that much when paul finds out that mr leonard used to be a track and field star he makes connections in paragraph 35 paul is alittle upset that mr leonard didn't tell him about his amazing college career but in paragraph 45 when paul realizes that him and mr leonard are very much alike he is happy and wants to give back to mr leonard
21047,8,2,when paul finds out that mr leonard was illeterate he understands that he should help him read just as mr leonard was helping him in track this is implied in paragraph 46 when the narrator tells mr leonard it is time for his 'training ' which means the narrator will help mr leonard to learn how to read
21048,8,2,the background information of mr leonard inspires paul the information inspires paul becuase he feels like there is a connection between himself and mr leonard mr leonard although not able to read was successful at other things including track by paul learning of mr leonard's past he feels more accepted and normal
21049,8,0,the background information on mr leonard had an effect on paul because he seemed anxious to know why mr leonard didn't hurdle anymore and what had happened
21050,8,2,mr leonard and paul are two characters that are quite similar in the story it says that both characters had a very hard time reading and they are both athletic so mr leonard's effect on paul is motivational he wants paul to not repeat mr leonard's past and instead push on and be the best he can be
21051,8,2,the effect that background information of mr leonard has on paul is that he is not alone and the emotions were all too familiar to him he knew them well the feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class he knows that even if he can't read like everyone else he can still be good at something mr leonard gave his time to help paul excel so paul decided to see mr leonard excel at something to
21052,8,2,once paul finds out about mr leonard past he is in shock not knowing that the hall monitor mr leonard was a star in college who won the four hundred meter hurdles and broke records
21053,8,1,paul is suspicious on why mr leonard didn't tell him about his past he questions him on why he didn't tell him about his track records in college then mr leonard tells him he flunked out because he couldn't read paul gets influeced by this to teach mr leonard to read because mr leonard influenced him to run hurdles
21054,8,1,background has an effect on paul including encouragement and confidence paul tells of how he met mr leonard and how he became close to him later paul tells about on the track and because paul already knows mr leonard he has confidence in his abilities already after the first time around the track paul feels discouraged but mr leonard already being his friend helps to encourage paul
21055,8,1,the information probaby has a big effect on paul because paul can't read either paul may feel he can look up to mr leonard and that he is his romodel
21056,8,2,paul is empathetic to mr leonard's troubles like paul mr leonard was poor in school paul feels closer to him saying that he knew mr leonard's feelings and words 'were all too familiar' he realizes then that mr leonard helped him excel in something and offers to help mr leonard excel in something too
21057,8,1,he felt like they had something incommon 'i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew '
21058,8,2,the effect that the background check of mr leonard has on paul is a good one it opens paul's eyes and shows him that you have to be a good student first then you can be an athlete second if you dont do it in the classroom then there is no point in even going out to try and do a sport mr leonard wants to live his dreams through of paul because he wants paul to do something that he was not capeable of doing this was a huge lesson in paul's life and it took him one step closer to succeeding his dreams and goals
21059,8,0,it gave him more confidence knowing that mr leonard actually knows what he is doing but he is also consernd why he didnt tell him about it in the first day
21060,8,2,paul doesn't seemed surprised that mr leonard was a star athlete in track he's more interested in why mr lenoard never told him about it before paul asks mr leonard why he had never said anything before and leonard smiles sadly while he remembers the past it turns out mr leonard wasn't a good reader either and flunked out of college paul has the same feelings and relates to mr lenoard paul then supports him by telling mr leonard 'it's time to start your training '
21061,8,2,the reader gets background on mr leonard from a track website that the coach gave him to look up paul didn understand why he quiet but he also didn know that leonard didn no how to read leonard had friends in high school that would help him get thru all his classes but college was alot harder and leonard could not keep up with the school work so he flunked out so paul decided to help leonard to learn how to read like loenard helped paul to overcome an obstical
21062,8,0,he fells bad that his teacher for track lost his scholar ship for not being able to read thats what paul is dong right now is learning how to read and run the hurdles and paul can help his teacher learn how to read
21063,8,2,when paul first discovers mr leonard's seemingly glorious past he is puzzled at the notion that mr leonard would keep that information from him paul then must decide to confront mr leonard upon doing so he makes a greater realization that draws him closer to not only mr leonard but himself too paul finds out that mr leonard also struggled with literature and reading in fact mr leonard's inferiority regarding the subject helps paul to identify with him for he too is plagued with the same problem because paul discovers this he feels a drive he feels a reason he actually begins to feel adequate now with the understanding that he can achieve he feels reason to pay back the favor he decides to help mr leonard learn to read well without knowing that mr leonard had once been such a star athelete who failed in academics paul would have never had made such a life changing change realizing his value
21064,8,0,he wants to help the kid because he is a good boy and
21065,8,0,paul is mad that someone check's his hall pass twice a week and he really don't like that becuase they think he is going some where else then where he says he is going so that is way they check his hall pass twice a week
21066,8,2,i personally think mr leonard giving paul his story about what he use to be and how it came crashing down really motivated paul and made him want to help mr leonard the fact that mr leonard's dream was shattered because couldn't read made paul want to work hard so that he wouldn't have to fall in the same pattern as mr leonard did when he was younger he probably felt as if he needed to do something to make up for what happened in his younger years so paul took him to the learning center so that he could get some much needed help in reading paul felt that mr leonard's words were 'all too familiar' because paul was having trouble reading as well
21067,8,0,i guess paul is a friend that didnt git in so yhen it was his bussness to
21068,8,0,paul realizes that mr leonard is trying to help him become great at hurdles mr leonard knows that paul had trouble reading but he worked to fix the problem by being in the remedial reading program mr leonard was fantastic at hurdles in college but he couldn't read so no colleges wanted him to go there he wanted paul to be able to be mentally and physically well
21069,8,0,it made people think of him different
21070,8,1,paul was shocked but was feeling not alone paul said that mr leonard had givin his time to help him with track and to help him excel at somthing it made paul realise what he could do for mr leonard
21071,8,2,they become good friends and because of mr leonard he gets very good at hurdles he finds out that mr leonard can't read and because of the learning center paul helps mr leonard how to read
21072,8,0,what
21073,8,0,paul realizes that he needs to learn to read if he is going to be successful in hurdling because mr leonard had to quit what he was loved doing because he couldnt read and thats what makes him realize
21074,8,1,by finding information about mr leonard on the internet it gave paul the motivation to help mr leonard just like mr leonard had helped paul
21075,8,2,when paul finds out about mr leonard he wonders why he didn't tell him he approaches mr leonard about it and finds out that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read paul decides he wants to help mr leonard just as mr leonard helped him
21076,8,0,he sees that he is trying to get him to do something with his life he doesnt want to see him end up in the situation he was in he knows the kid is trying to read and that he should do something else to motivate him leonardo is trying to be a roll modle and make a difference in teh kids life
21077,8,2,paul find out that mr leonard was a good track runner but not so good at reading it effected paul by giving him a reason to run and work harder
21078,8,0,it has a big effect on paul because mr leonard had the same problems he had when he was younger in the story he shows mr leonard what he found out about him and mr leonard felt sad because he didn't want paul to find out he couldn't read either
21079,8,1,in this story when paul gets the background information on mr leonard it opens up a bunch of different windows to him paul starts thinking about why he didn't run anymore paul confronted mr leonard about it and discovered mr leonard was in the same shoes as paul was paul then realizes why mr leonard was trying to help him
21080,8,0,he had an effect on paul because he tryed so hard to be a good student
21081,8,1,it helps him feel better knowing that he wasn't the only one with the same kind of reading problem
21082,8,0,in highschool lenard was like paul not good at school work but a good athletic guy
21083,8,2,he is overwhelmed with who he is talking to and that mr leonard has the same problem he does by not bring able to read when paul said ' but you wnet to college '
21084,8,1,the result of the background information is that paul finds out that mr leonard was a college freshman who broke records for the 400 meter hurdles the impact on paul is tramendous because he relizes he has a collage all star working with him
21085,8,0,doesnt make sense
21086,8,0,they both have the same problem not being able to read and do good in school
21087,8,2,paul is surprised to find out that mr leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals when he was a collage freshman then he found out that he had flunked out of college because he couldn't read so paul decided to help mr leonard
21088,8,2,in paragraph 5 lines 1 3 when paul finds that mr leonard couldn't read he knows the feeling 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called pon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answere everyone else knew ' then paul realized he can help mr leonard ''c'mon mr leonard ' i said walking back toward school 'it's time to start your training ''
21089,8,1,the effect that the background information on mr lenard has on the reader is inspiring to him paul finds out that mr lenonard had the same struggles with reading and school work that he has but he still was an exellent runner making paul want to keep at it so that he could be the same way it was also inspiring because the teacher told him that he flunked out of college because he did not get good grades that would make paul want to work harder at his school work so that the same thing would not happen to him
21090,8,0,paul and mr leonard are talkin one day after practice and paul finds out that mr leonard went to a learning center when he was in high school mr leonard also was an amazing athlete he did track and field and was very good at it
21091,8,1,that he knows that mr leonard is just like him
21092,8,2,i think that at first paul wonders why mr leonard did not tell him that he used to be a really fast hurdler i think paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this once paul finds out that mr leonard has a hard time reading too paul begins to fell really empathetic towards mr leonard
21093,8,2,the effect the background information about mr leonard had on paul was inspiring it was inspiring because both mr leonard and paul had gone were going through the same thing mr leonard couldn't read but was excellent at sports and paul couldn't read but mr leonard helped him excell at something so he wouldn't be a total 'loser ' mr leonard said it sucked to be picked last in gym class so he tried to help paul feel good about himself
21094,8,0,mrs leonard didn't want him to go to the reading center
21095,8,0,that the kid didn't know about mr leonard that he ued to run track back in his days as a college student
21096,8,0,the effect that background information had on paul was that it made paul think that mr leonard was a quitter being so good and maybe the best at something paul wondered why on earth would someone quit if they were that good if paul would not have talked to mr leonard about this he maybe would have quit also
21097,8,1,it tells paul that he can do anything if he just puts his mind to it and keeps trying he will succeed in anything and everything he trys
21098,8,2,paul's opinion of mr leonard changes for the better paul does not realize he is running for a former famous athlete and so has no reason to prove himself when he finds out about mr leonard's past and what happened to him paul is sympathetic and decides to teach him to read by saying 'c'mon mr leonard it's time to start your training '
21099,8,1,paul was shocked that mr leonard didnt tell him about his past and when mr leonard did he listened to see what he had to say when paul heard mr leonard speak and tell his story he heard the emotions in the his voice it made paul think about the times when he was in class and he got called out by the teacher to read a story or a book and he felt embrassed an then he thought about what mr leonard was trying to do for him so he thought about what he could do for mr leonard
21100,8,1,when paul found this information he was shocked that he was hiding something so big like that from him paul was confused that a college level athleate was not good in school
21101,8,1,the backround information about mr leonard has a big effect on paul because paul understands why mr leonard would want to coach him it also makes paul want to work harder for his coach because they have had alot of the same struggles i also think mr leonard would make paul better than he was so paul didnt have some of the same problems he did
21102,8,2,paul finds out mr leonard was actually a very good athlete he went to nationals for track and field and broke records he also found out mr leonard was not very smart and that he flunked out of college this made paul want to help mr leonard to get back up and get into track and field again paul wants to train him now
21103,8,2,paul had not known about mr leonard so he did as asked paul then was asked to go to the gym after school so he went and was tought how to jump hurtles really fast he then goes to the track and feild coach and shows him what he can do and the coach asked him to look up mr leonard at a website to find out why he is so fast then he learns about a lot about mr leonard which i think inspired him to do his best and to help out his new found friend mr leonard
21104,8,0,paul met mr leonard when i started middle school he was a hall monitor whose job it was to keep students moving along from one classroom to the next
21105,8,2,mr leonard tells him that he also cant read and lost his scholarship for college and couldn't continue to be a racer this made paul realize why mr leonard wanted him to do hurdles and that the learning center can help him learn to read
21106,8,0,that infomation effected paul by feeling that he has been let down he looks up to mr grabowski and now sees a fall between the two
21107,8,2,the backround information has a tremendous effect on paul i say this because he had no idea he was being trained by a collegite athlete he also realized that mr leonard had the same problem he had in high school but didnt do anything to improve his study skills paul realizes the signicance of mr leonards help
21108,8,2,the background infromation that paul the narrator gets in this story is mr leonard was an all star track runner in high school he broke records and got scholarships paul also learned that mr leonard had a hard time comprihending reading like himself mr leonard flunked college because he could not read well paul knew what it was like for mr leonard becaue paul could not read well nor could he comprihend things easily
21109,8,1,the reader and paul share the same mind frame it states in the article 'no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read ' they are both very dedicated to their athletics however when you cannot make grades you have to sarafice the things you love for the things you will need to know in the future in the article it states 'i know them well i didn't know the answer everyone else knew ' when it comes to education they are both slow at comphrending and understanding what the other students catch onto quicker
21110,8,2,the background information that paul gathers about mr leonard is that he use to be a college track star he found out that he wont the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that mr leonard broke records mr leonard then tells him 'i was a good athlete but not a good student we had no learning centers in our school i relied on friends to help me get by but even then the work was always too hard ' it turns out that just like paul mr leonard is a talented athlete but did not recieve the resources that he needed to read luckily paul does have those resources and talent so hopefully he can make it farther than mr leonard
21111,8,0,mr leonard found out paul failed out of college because he could not read when mr leonard found out about this he said he was going to help him get help reading at a help center by doing a backgroung check he is helping paul out
21112,8,2,it makes paul kinda in a way want to help mr leonard but i also think that its gonna motivate paul because he knows that mr leonard really wants him to succeed at this sport mr leonard tells paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read he also said that he went to college but flunked out because it was too hard and how no college wanted a runner who couldnt read so all in all i think that paul is doing this for mr leonard
21113,8,0,that he was happy to find out what happend to himand what happend after school then he was sad to find out that he had droped out of college because that he could not read after that he found out that it is a ok promble that you can't read to it is better to try and do not give up at all
21114,8,0,he gets asked about it in the hallway
21115,8,1,mr leonard shares with paul that he was a hurderler back in the day he was a great athlete and even broke records but then mr leonard tells paul about his misfortune mr leonard couldn't read paul struggles greatly with reading so they both resemble eachother in that aspect however paul is in a learning center to get better at it mr leonard never had that opportunity
21116,8,0,paragraph 33 sentence 1 he knows what he is doing
21117,8,0,paul realizes that it does not matter wheather you are the best athlete in the world colleges are looking for an athlete with good educational skills as well
21118,8,1,the effect it had on paul was that he was just like him when he was younger so when paul saw what he has accomplished then he feels that he can do this
21119,8,2,when paul hears about how mr leonard had a hard time in high school and collage the narrator learns that mr leonard didn't have the type of resources to help him during his high school and collage days paul felt much sympathy for mr leonard and decided to help him read
21120,8,0,the author uses many signs of foreshadowing in this story the foreshadowing lead the reader to assume he is not educated well the author begins by introducing mr leonard as the hall monitor this suggests to the reader that he does not have an advanced education if he was just a hall monitor when mr leonard ask paul what his name is in paragraph 24 it suggest that he either doesnt have a good memory or cannot read the pass another incident like this occurs when paul shows mr leonard his printout and mr leonard responds with a confused look the author's uses of foreshadowing allows the reader to get to know mr leonard personally before the information is revealed to the main character paul
21121,8,1,the background information helps paul realize why mr leonard wanted to help him and it allows paul to help mr leonard in return
21122,8,2,things were different back then mr leonard was told that grades didnt matter that he would have all the help he needed but that was all a lie he ended up losing his scholarship and flunking out of college no college wanted someone who couldn't read mr leonards were words that were familiar to paul he was embarrassed when he was called on or when he didnt know the answer because he couldn't read all those feelings that mr leonard had paul had the exact mr leonard gave his time to help paul succeed at something after paul realized what me leonard was doing for him he wanted to help mr leonard out paul had then started training with mr leonard
21123,8,1,it has a lot of effect on him because mr leonard is trying to help paul over come obsticales and knowing that mr leonard was a national finalist made paul wonder why he is helping him then he basicla said that he doesnt want paul to end up like him and not be able to read so that probably encouraged aul to try harder in school and learn to read
21124,8,2,when paul first discovers the shocking new information on mr leonard he is a bit confused when mr leonard explains fully however paul quickly goes from confused to understanding the way paul can relate to mr leonard helps deepen their relationship and makes paul a little emotional then inspired by how mr leonard helped him despite the troubles he had had himself paul decides he wants to return the favor and help out mr leonard
21125,8,0,he is interested in it mr leonard broke lot of records and won a lot of races paul is lucky to have a coach like mr leonard
21126,8,1,paul and mr leonard are like the same person in this story only mr leonard has been through the things paul is going through now and mr leonard wants to help paul overcome his problems since he knows what he's going through
21127,8,0,it shows he wants someone like hhimself to achieve things he wasn't able to he can't read and paul struggles reading
21128,8,2,it helps paul know that he isn't the only one with this problem he realized that mr leonard had felt the same thing that he paul was feeling and like how mr leonard had helped him paul decides to help mr leonard
21129,8,2,paul wants to help mr leonard he feels the same way as mr leonard did back when he was in high school hes going to train him on how to read and mr leonard is goin to trian paul how to do hurdles
21130,8,1,it has an effect on paul because he completely understands what mr leonard has gone through in a way he went through the same thing and it states in the story that mr leonard's words were all too familiar after learning mr leonard's story paul now has someone that he can connect with it also will now make him feel better about himself because he knows he is not the only one that does not achieve at everthing
21131,8,2,from the background of mr leonard paul feels that he can relate to him way more because he can not read either paul feels that if he can do what mr leonard taught him he can be just like him also at the end of the story where paul finds out that mr leonard could not read paul wants to teach him to read just like mr leonard taught him to run hurdles
21132,8,1,the background information on mr leonard that paul gets is only a way to motivate him more he realizes he can be a good athlete even though the has trouble reading because he has a good relationship with someone who went through the same thing
21133,8,1,the backgroung knowledge that the narrator has for mr leonard makes the narrator respect mr leonard more he knows mr leonard is an accomplished athlete that knows what he is talking about therefore he respects and follows his advice
21134,8,0,when paul gets the background information about mr leonard it effects paul because just like leonard he can't read but they both are good at hurdles only bad thing is that leonard coldn't get through college because he couldn't read so that could have a huge effect on paul because he doesn't know how to read
21135,8,2,when paul prints out that paper on mr leonard he learns that he was the best hurdler in the nation paul also learns that mr leonard couldn't read just like paul couldn't then mr leonard tells paul how he flunked out of college paul realizes how important reading is and that he can overcome any obstacle
21136,8,2,when paul gets background information on mr leonard he feels that he can relate to mr leonard since both of them couldn't read in school and wre both great runners it also determines paul to do better in school and track
21137,8,1,the information that paul learns about mr leonared makes paul want to be better in the sport that he wants to be in and try out
21138,8,2,paul figures out that mr leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well paul didn't understand how he got to college paul decided to help mr leonard learn how to read 'c'mon mr leonard ' i said walking back toward school 'it's time to start your training '
21139,8,0,mr leonard handed the paper back and looked at the ground his brow furrowed his voice cracked as he spoke
21140,8,0,it shows him you can be good at one thing but then at another you might not do so well people are good at different things and noone can do everything it kinda gives him the push to do what he loves to do
21141,8,2,mr leonard eventually tells paul that he also had difficulties reading and doing school work in general when he was paul's age however he was a good runner his athletic ability got him into college but later as a result of his lack of academic ability he was kicked out paul could very much relate to mr leonard's words when mr leonard told him all of this paul was then encouraged to help him learn academically considering mr leonard had help him achieve success in running the hurdles
21142,8,1,'but you went to college' paul seems as if he's supprised
21143,8,1,it changes paul whole outllook on mr leonard and he feels sorry for him in fact he feels so bad for him that he starts training with him at end of the passage
21144,8,1,it helps paul find out who mr leonard is it also helps him understand how similar each of them are to each other
21145,8,2,he probably does not understand why a man who was such a great athlete is checking for hall passes at a high school when he asks why he never told him he realises that he is pretty much in the same situation that mr leonard was in
21146,8,1,paul is a student that has trouble reading and he takes part in a remedial reading program that allows him to get help on reading a couple of times a week he would leave english early to go to this program and every time mr leonard saw him he would ask were he was going and check his hall pass so that he could make sure that he was going to the right place when mr leonard asked paul to stay after school one day and meet him in the gym paul said ok becuase he would take any route that didnt lead to doing homework once paul got to the gym he was asked by mr leonard whether he enjoyed basketball and he nodded his head not so he took him outside to the track and had him jump over some hurdles when he was finished he said that was aweful but mr leonard said that it was good and he would get better as he practiced so he told paul to show up tommorow with running shows and a pair of shorts i began to wonder why mr leonard was helping him like this and once he met the high school track coach and he told him to look mr leonard up he found out that he was a very accomplished track runner back in college and he fluncked out of college becuase the scouts did not care about grades and so he had to do harder work and couldnt do it even with the tutors help paul began to realize that mr leonard and himself are alot alike and he wanted to help a child reach his potential athletically since paul and already sawt help in his learning troubles
21147,8,2,i think the background information of mr leonard inspired paul after paul found out that mr leonard was a star track runner he was shocked that mr leonard had not already told him paul decided that he wanted to help mr leonard to learn how to read because afterall mr leonard was helping him become a track runner this helps paul relate to mr leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners
21148,8,1,the effect that the background information has on paul makes him see mr leonard as an inspiration the information allows paul to personally see himself in mr leonard and he compares himself to him for instance when he reads the information from the website about mr leonard he is astonished by his accomplishments once mr leonard tells paul about his past paul is inspired by his words once the information has sunk in to paul's mind he uses mr leonard's story to motivate himselft to be better than mr leonard has turned out to be
21149,8,2,he is familiar with the things that mr leonard had went through neither of them can read very well paul feels compelled to help mr leonard with his reading skills since he helped paul improve his running ability
21150,8,1,i think paul knowing about mr leonard is a good thing it shuold make paul want to strive to trie harder so he doesnt end up in the same situation as mr leonard
21151,8,2,he was intrigued by the efforts of mr leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out because mr leonard flunked he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed in the last sentence paul says ''c'mon mr lenoard it's time to start your training '' he want's to help him to excel at something as mr leonard had for him
21152,8,2,the effect that the background information that paul finds on mr leonard is shocking to paul he wanted to why mr leonard wouldn't tell him about about mr leonard being the star athelet when he was in high school when paul meets up with mr leonard he asks him ' why didn't you tell me about this ' mr leonard then goes on with his story about how he use to be like paul and flunked out of college because of his grades and how he was told in high school that he couldn't do track anymore because of his grades and that in college they would have tutors for him
21153,8,2,paul does not know what mr leonard did before he worked at the school paul is amazed when he learns that mr leonard ran track in college and set national records as a freshman mr leonard then says he wasn't a good student and his running career was ended because of it paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay mr leonard for his time by teaching him how to read
21154,8,2,the high school track and field coach automatcially assumed that leonard grabowski was the person that was helping paul with track he also gives paul a piece of paper with a website url and tells him to do a search for grabowski this search pulls up information about leonard and how good he was at the hurdles his freshman year in college paul asked leonard what had happened after leonard had the best race of his life leonard told paul that he was a good athelete but he didn't know how to read so he was a horrible student this was touching to paul because now he had someone else to relate to since leonard didn't know how to read either the information that paul got will push him harder to learn how to read
21155,8,1,the effect that the background information about mr leonard has on paul is to try harder when paul showed mr leonard that he knew about his times in college mr leonard told paul how hard it was
21156,8,0,paul feels just like mr leonard felt in high school and college
21157,8,2,the information that paul gets helps him understand why mr leonard was sympathetic for him mr leonard like paul had trouble reading he also had potentinal to be a star track athlete however mr leonard had no chance to receive any help with his reading issues and as such was not able to make it at the end of the story it's implied that paul was going to help mr leonard with his reading just like mr leonard helped paul with his track prowess
21158,8,2,it surprises him because mr leonard never told him about how he was a college track star it also makes him very excited that he is being coached by a college star
21159,8,2,paul understands now that the reason mr leonard wants to help paul is because he too couldnt read when he was in high school and realizes that they are a lot a like
21160,8,2,paul finds out that mr leonard was a big track star and that he could not read so paul believes that mr leonard is helping him because he knows what its like not to read and to be picked on and flunk out of school
21161,8,2,after paul finds out that mr leonard can't read paul decides to help mr leonard the same way that mr leonard helped him
21162,8,0,paul wants to be like mr lenard now so he askes mr lenard about his college track days
21163,8,2,paul was influenced by mr leonard trying to help him and it was more helpful to paul to see that mr leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that paul himselkf struggles with it means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing an example would be mr leonard doesn't help paul learn to read but he starts to train him in hurdles helping him learn how to over come obsticals
21164,8,2,when paul realizes that mr leonard had broken records in track and field and had gone to college he wondered why mr leonard had never shared said information with him when he asked mr leonard about it he discovered that much like himself mr leonard had trouble reading and learning in school after discovering that he had many things in common academically with mr leonard paul decided that he would help mr leonard much like mr leonard had voluntarily helped him he began 'training' mr leonard to read well
21165,8,0,paul was going to help the teacher with things he needed help on he did this by walkin towards the school telling mr leonard it was time for his training
21166,8,0,paul didnt know why mr leonard didnt tell him bout his past as being a track star when paul asked its because he had the same problem paul has
21167,8,1,when paul discovered what mr leonard had accomplished in his life it gave him hope and courage to do the same he was dtermined to be a better athlete he wanted to prove he could be a pro athlete one day and make everyone proud of him
21168,8,0,some of the effects in the storty was in the back grond information 'i was a good athlete ' he said softly ' but not a good student we had ne learning centers in our school he relied on friends to help him get by
21169,8,0,they are kinda alike in ways because mr leonard cannot read well and neither can paul
21170,8,2,in the story paul seemed suprised that mr leonard had been a former track runner and that he was good at the hurtles
21171,8,0,paul thinks the mr leonard is just a hall moniter and paul does not know that mr leonrad had anything to do with being a track star
21172,8,2,the information that he finds out about mr leonard shocks paul when he finds out mr leonard was a national champion he is astounded and later when he finds out the reason he quit is brcause he failed out of school he knows he needs to focus on his reading so the same thing does not happen to him
21173,8,0,the background information that paul gets about mr leonard makes paul upset paul feels sorry curious about it paul pointed to the picture and asked mr leonard about it
21174,8,0,he was a college freshaman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals he broke records he broke records and he was an eceptional athlete
21175,8,1,mr leonards background information really makes paul want to join track bcause this whole time he was putting his self down and not realizing that it only takes a little talent to become a star mr leonard tells him that he didn't do to well in school and that was something that paul had incommon with mr leonard and when a teacher or coach can relate to a student or a team member that can bring out the best in a person and make them want to reach there goal faster which is what paul ends up doing in the story
21176,8,0,paul was more interested in his life 'well what happened after that '
21177,8,0,paul thinks that mr leonard was a man that was mean a didn't really like kids
21178,8,0,in the story it shows that he is a nice guy but he can be a little bit mean as well too the effect of the background information is that he done track and he ran really really fast but than he lost his scholarship for college due to his grades even though they told him that they could help him with his grades but he flunked out anyways
21179,8,0,mr leonard and paul shared that they both have trouble reading in school and need help to be successful
21180,8,1,the effect that the background information has on paul is that the information makes him very surprised it motivates him to try harder though because he struggles with school just like mr leonard did he knew exactly how mr leonard felt because he had been through the exact same things paul saw himself in mr leonard and it motivated him to change himself along with mr leonard again
21181,8,0,mr leonard reflects who he is now paul is watching himself in him that we should be better than he and make mr leonard happy by giving hima job to become his coach
21182,8,0,paul finds out that mr leonard was a college athlete and realises he has a great coach this helps hm get a chance to work out with the highschool coach
21183,8,1,paul starts to understand why mr leonard is helping him train and how important it is for him to work hard at getting better in reading
21184,8,2,the effect that the background information on mr leonard has on paul is that him and mr leonard are very similar because they both had troubles with knowing how to read both also know how it feels to be embarrassed by the fact that they can not read
21185,8,2,after he goes on the website and finds the articles about mr leonard he wonders why he never told him so when he saw him next he asked him why he never told him about being one of the best on the track team and he told him he couln't read so that influenced paul to teach mr leonard how to read
21186,8,0,he was a hurdler back then and he coudnt read
21187,8,2,mr leonard's background information inspires paul he finds out about mr leonard winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals as a freshman in college mr leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read nobody really helped him paul decides he's going to work harder in school and at track
21188,8,2,paul probably didn't have that much respect for mr leonard i mean he had some because he never cried and complained and mr leonard reached out to him because of mr leonard paul gained respect for himself and didn't look so down on himself as much when paul learned that mr leonard was once a track star paul was shocked it seemed paul didn't know why mr leonard didn't tell everyone that he broke records paul learned that everyone has flaws in themselves but it's their job to find what they are best at
21189,8,1,the information about mr leomard gets the narrator wondering why if mr leomard was such a good runner then why is he a school monitor it makes paul mysterious about mr leomard in a way also because mr leonard is too good of an athelete to be a hallway monitor
21190,8,2,the information that paul obtained about mr leonard probably confused and suprised paul at the same time he was most likely excited to learn that the person who has been training him was a record breaking college runner but confused because mr leonard never told him
21191,8,0,the background information uncovered has a positive effect on the relationship between paul and mr leonard you can tell this by the last line where it is incinuated that after they practice track they will practice reading together
21192,8,2,the effect the background information ahas in paul is that when mr leonard was telling paul all the things that was wrong it reminded paul of himself when mr leonard said that he couldn't read and that he wasn't smart enough to make it through college paul got a glimpse of his future paul knew that the only reason that happened to him was that he never seeked help so that is why he told mr leonard his training is to begin
21193,8,1,when paul gets information about mr leonard from his past he is shocked at first he is more sympathetic towards mr leonard so he decides to help hi out by trainging him again like how he trained paul from the passage paul says to mr leonard walking towards school ' its time to start your trainging
21194,8,2,the backgroung information that paul learns about mr leonard makes paul feel better about himself paul can relate to mr leonard in the same ways since they both have trouble with reading
21195,8,0,mr leonard is a quiet man about himself and doesn't mention himself or his past much throughout the story the track coach gives paul a website to go look up about mr leonard paul finds out that mr leonard was a national 400 meter hurdle champion as a freshman in college paul wants to know why he didn't keep running throughout college but then he finds out that mr leonard did not know how to read that well himself and flunked out of college
21196,8,1,paul did not know about mr leonard being a track star in high school so when the track coach gave paul the website to check out he asked mr leonard why he never told paul he was a track star paul is glad to have a real athlete to help him so now it's his turn to help mr leonard
21197,8,1,paul says 'the wnotions in mr leonard's words wew all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment
21198,8,1,the background information startled paul when he herd about mr leonard
21199,8,0,it shows him that he can still acomplish things even if he has trouble reading he wants to help mr leaonard learn how to read that way he will not feel ashamed talking abou his college exsperience paul tells mr leonard 'its time to start your training '
21200,8,0,he starts to want to work out with the team after finding out it has a great impact on his decision to continue with runing
21201,8,2,paul is confused and somewhat angry 'why didn't you tell me about this ' paul was astonished at the fact that mr leonard would not tell him about such an amazing achomplishment mr leonard replied with comments such as 'i was a good athlete but not a good student ' 'no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read ' paul felt as if he had some of mr leonard's qualities in him and since mr leonard help him he should return the favor 'it's time too start you training '
21202,8,0,mr leanard was a hall monator in middle school he was select few in a leraning program he also worked with a tutor he wroked with mr leonard with track
21203,8,0,mr leonard was a poor reader and the effect that background information has on paul the emotions in mr leonard words were all to familiar they knew them well
21204,8,0,i think the effect on paul is huge considering that somebody of that skill is taking their time to help him overcome 'obstacles' in his life the story shows this when mr leonard asks what paul is doing after school and then taking time to bring him to the track and train with him
21205,8,2,paul finds out that mr leonard could not read just like himself and also that mr leonard was a track star it made paul feel honored to be taught by a track and field legend
21206,8,1,when paul learns that mr leonard used to be a record breaking track star his freshman year in college it opens up a whole new perspective of him he realizes why mr leonard has been helping him and decides that he too can help mr leonard overcome obstacles in his life
21207,8,2,paul becomes fast at the 400m hurdles and mr leonard broke records as a freshman at nationals but they both can't read and mr leonard failed out of college beccause of it and it shocks paul greatly cause now he is put into an identical postion
21208,8,2,the information effected paul because mr leonard is a great athlete mr leonard was very good in school and he fluncked out of college because of his grades mr leonard inspired paul because they are very similar paul was bad at school also and paul is also a great athlete it gave paul so inspiration in life to succeed
21209,8,2,paul is shocked when he finds out who mr leonard realy is then when paul learns that mr leonard cant read either he has remorse for him paul new his pain all to well and thats why he decided to help mr leonard learn to read
21210,8,1,paul figures out more about mr leonard's past and an explanation why he was coaching paul in track paul then wants to know about why mr leonard stopped doing track in college
21211,8,0,they like to play sports and they dont know how to read
21212,8,2,the effect that the background information has on paul was that he became motivated for something he had never done before he had felt like he had something in common with mr leonard mr leonard went through the same troubles as paul is now mr leonard said that he could not read either
21213,8,0,paul wonders why mr leonard never told him about being a champion at hurdling he finds out that mr leonard didn't tell him because he was ashamed that he had flinked out of college because he couldn't read
21214,8,1,the background information paul aquires allows paul to understand him more and where mr leonard is coming from it motivates paul to work hard at hurdles and to keep working hard for his grades
21215,8,1,paul feels that mr leonard and him have so much in common paul has trouble reading and the reason mr leonard didn't know his name was because he was a poor reader as well after paul found out about mr leonard it made him feel comfortable knowing that he wasn't alone in his situation and someone just as great as mr leonard struggled as well
21216,8,1,because pauls coach child life is simmilar to his as in a good runner but a bad reader
21217,8,2,paul is very impressed by mr leonard's track talents he feels very empathetic for mr leonard when he learns he can't read because paul has the same problem paul has even felt the same feelings of embarrassment when asked to read aloud for this reason he feels for mr leonard
21218,8,2,when paul found out that mr leonard was a track star in collage he was amazed by his discovery when paul saw mr leonard the next day paul asked him about the printout that paul had printed out the night before then mr leonard explain the first parts of his track career the paul asked him what else happened and mr leonard explain that he copied off his friends in highschool and didn't do hardly any of the work but once he got the collage he didn't know what to do so therefore he lost his scholarship and flunked out of collage
21219,8,2,paul is shocked by the information about mr leonard in paragraph 45 paul explains that mr leonards emotions are similar to his own
21220,8,2,in the story paul finds out that mr leonard was just like him in school couldnt read paul was all too familiar with the words mr leonard had said mr leonard had flunked out of school and lost his scholarship paul is willing to help mr leonard learn how to read and mr leonard is willing to help paul get a scholarship
21221,8,1,at first pault just thinking mr leonard is a hall monitor gets him motivated to try doing hurdles as the story progresses and the learns that he has trouble ready just as paul does he feals closer to him and even more motivated the more things he learns about him the more motivated he becomes nearing the end of the story when paul learns that mr leonard was actually a collage choach he became even more motivated pretty much everything mr leonard did helped motivate paul
21222,8,1,paul feels empathetic towards mr leonard's predicament as he knows what it is like to feel embarrassed over reading paul comes to understand why mr leonard wants paul to keep trying and to keep working hard and paul greatfully accepts
21223,8,1,the effect this had on paul was good he wanted to start to help mr leonard paul said that is was time for mr leonard's training this was a good thing because mr leonard's life is a lot like pauls so he feels he can be the same he knows he should learn to read then he can excel in the hurdles like mr leonard this had great impact on paul
21224,8,2,paul had that familiar incident when he couldnt read and like mr leonard he really felt for him
21225,8,2,near the end of the story paul visits the website mr leonard tells him to go to and paul is amazed mr leonard was a track star in college mr leonard tells paul that he flunked out of college and lost his colleg scholarship because he couldn't read and paul was empathetic and in return decides to teach mr leonard how read since he helped paul in excelling at hurdling
21226,8,0,from what i read the backround check helped paul feel better for himself when mr leonard told him he flunked out of college because they didn't have a learning center so he relied on his friends to help him pass when paul learned that he felt bad for mr leonard paul decided to start training with mr leonard to make him feel good about himself and show him that he did learn something
21227,8,2,paul was impressed by mr leonard's record as a college track star which is evident by paul's interest and impressed tone when he confronted mr leonard when mr leonard informed paul of his reading disability paul sympathized with mr leonard's emotions of embarrassment the challenge and talent that mr leonard had in common with paul inspired paul to return mr leonard's generosity with his time so paul will likely teach mr leonard to read
21228,8,2,paul learned about mr leonard from the high school track coach in the story he learned of the site on the internet and look it up giving fim the information that mr leonard was a very talented college hurdler that later he found out couldn't read paul then finds out that mr leonard was kicked out of college and cound't get into another one because he couldn't read
21229,8,2,the background information effects paul because it shows paul what mr leonard was when he was at his age they both had problems with reading and they both were good runners paul learns that mr leonard gotten kicked out of college for not being able to read and had to give up his scholarship this is what effects paul and he would learn from mr leonard mistakes and become a better reader
21230,8,1,finding out about mr leonard's past has a big effect on paul it makes paul feel less alone because mr leonard really does know what he is going through in pharagraph 25 paul says that he understands what mr leonard went through in high school and college this new knowledge shows paul just how much mr leonard helped him because of this paul decides to help mr leonard
21231,8,0,mr leonard couldn't read either he was in the same position as paul when he was a kid
21232,8,1,it shows pual that there are hurddles in life that he will have to get over and by doing themin the track session will accomplish that
21233,8,2,paul find out that mr leonard was a track star but he flunked out because he made bad grades it makes paul think that he is not alone paul really wants to try now to read and teach mr leonard how to read
21234,8,1,paul is kind of shocked by what he discovers he went directly to mr leonard and asked why he never said anything paul feels a connection with mr leonard after this because they both run ran hurdles and have had a hard time with reading
21235,8,2,paul sees himself in mr leonard they both can't read but both are good at track
21236,8,2,when paul found out about mr leonard he was empathetic the emotions they both had was 'all too familiar' and paul has had the feelings also
21237,8,0,who's paul
21238,8,0,when paul gets mr leonard background informantion he is some what concerned about why mr leonard didnt tell paul about his past paul didnt judge him any different about him not being a good reader nor dropping out of college paul just returns the help that mr leonard gave ti him and tell mr leonard to go back to school
21239,8,0,paul is emberassed about not being going to the learning center and it dont seem like he really wanted to tell him where he was going mr leonard tries to help him with some stuff i gym because he gets picked last
21240,8,2,the effect it has on paul is that it motivates him and gives him more compassion it motivates him to take advantage of the help he gets in school so that he can have more oppurtunities instead of losing them like mr leonard had it also gives him more compassion because he decides to return the favor of what mr leonard had taught him about hurdling by beginning to teach mr leonard how to read
21241,8,1,after mr leonard tells paul about the past the expressions on his face seem all too real and familiar to paul he then feels that mr leonard has given his time to help him so he does the same for mr leonard
21242,8,2,the background information surprises paul because this man was helping him at a highschool instead of running for a team himself he did not expect the man to be famous he also learns how mr leonard's lack of ability to read had limited him and inspires him to keep trying
21243,8,1,the effect it had on paul was it made him understand mr leonard better and it brought them closer
21244,8,2,it has a really good effect on paul he finds out that a star athlete comes from a similar background niether of them could read and both good at track they helped eachother out
21245,8,0,paul has trouble reading as did mr leonard mr leonard knows how it feels but does not want to mislead or discourage paul so he tries to teach him what he learned a long time ago by training him to be the best he can be
21246,8,0,the information effects paul because mr leonard can't read and neither can paul mr leonard wants paul to be able to read because he never got the chance to learn how and he also knows that paul will be very good at running track
21247,8,0,when mr leonard told paul about him being a star athelete in college but his grades weren't good enough therefore he flunked out he started to feel bad for him
21248,8,2,paul knows that mr leonard had trouble reading when he was younger too he knows he's not the only person that can't read if you can achieve a goal you can do anything
21249,8,2,paul is shocked that mr leonard didnt inform him about being a star athlete and not being able to read he soon caught on that mr leonard was wanting to help him do something that he wasnt able to continue to do since he couldnt read in college paul was understanding about his problem since he himself could not read but was getting help for it unlike mr leonard did in conclusion at the end of the short story paul states 'c'mon mr leonard ' i said walking back toward school 'it's time to start your training ' now paul is going to assist mr leonard with his reading
21250,8,0,that stuff was going on behind his back and stuff was being said and he found out from different sources people and then it made a conflict within many people
21251,8,2,the background information that paul gets about mr leonard was familiar mr leonard didn't have good grades through school and also had a hard time reading paul was already getting help with his grades and reading before mr leonard started training him for track and field mr leonard didn't have help with his grades he is helping paul become the athlete that mr leonard used to be paul and mr leonard have had very similar childhoods
21252,8,2,paul learns that mr leonard used to be a hurdler in college and that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals when he asks mr leonard 'what happened after that ' mr leonard explains that he couldn't read and that he flunked out of college it reminded paul of the feelings of embarassment when he didn't know an answer that everyone else did or when he was call upon to read out loud
21253,8,1,as paul gets the url from another person and looks up mr leonard's history he knowtest all what went wrong paul wanted to help mr leonard by reteaching him everything he used to know and what there was to learn
21254,8,2,when pual finds out about mr leonard flunking out of college because he can't read he feels sympothy and he knows how mr leonard feels 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar i knew them well feelings of embarassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew ' paul p 45
21255,8,2,it gives paul away to see mr leonard as an equal paul now can see why mr leonard is helping him and is thankful paul then sees how he himself can pay back mr leonard by teaching him to read
21256,8,2,this background information helps paul realize why mr leonard was helping him out before knowing that mr leonard was a college track star paul didn't really have a reason for why he went out of his way to work with him paul also makes another realization when he finds out that mr leonard had trouble reading and learning just like he did
21257,8,1,the background information paul recieves about mr leonard actually encourages him to strive to excel in his track and field in fact it boosts his confidence the reader knows that mr leonard's story has touched paul when he realizes inside of his head that his mentor was just like him when he was younger then paul decides to encourage mr leonard
21258,8,1,the background information that the narrator finds on paul brings the two characters closer when the narrator finds out that paul was a track star he is even more inspired but when paul tells him that he dropped out of college he feels as if he let the narrator down you know this because paul's voice trails off and he feels not go enough
21259,8,0,he the narrator finds out that mr leonard was once a star athelete at his college but dropped out because of grades
21260,8,2,this effected paul because he saw how the hall monitor helped him succeed in a sport so he wanted to help the hall monitor read paul connected leonard because they both had a hard time reading once paul knew leonard couldn't read that well he decides to teach him as leonard tought paul leonard was a great athleet but got kicked out of school when he flunked out of school
21261,8,2,the effect that the background information has on paul about mr leonard is similar to paul's own life paul was one of the few selected to go to the learning center and then when paul found out that mr leonard flunked college that effect gave them simularities the effect made paul want to work harder and he took mr leonard to the learning center with him
21262,8,0,he is black mailing him
21263,8,1,the effect of the background information was that paul was understanding of how it feels to be the outcast that can not read and needed the extra help i believe that only made paul respect him more and relate to him more even though mr leonard was ashamed of his disablity paul was accepting because he could relate also it gave paul the opportunity to return a favor to mr leonard paul was able to help out mr leonard and maybe teach him how to read better this causes their relationship to become more of an equal respect
21264,8,0,he learns he was a dropout of collage but was still a trackstar he wants paul to do track and also help him out
21265,8,1,he dosen't understand why mr leonard didn't go threw with college he then realizes that mr leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read the narrator knows why mr leonard is helping him he just want to see the narrator acomplish somthing great he knows how it feels to not be able to read he understands how it isn't fun getting picked last in gym overall he just wants paul to do well in life
21266,8,1,paul is shocked
21267,8,0,when he went and did research on mr leonard he found that he was a great runner in college and wanted to be like him refferring to thirty eight he told him that he was a college freshman and he won the four hundred meter hurdles and that inspired him deeply
21268,8,2,the effect the background information had on paul was that paul knew how mr leonard's felt about not being able to read and about being an outcast on things he couldn't do paul knew the emotions in mr leonard's words they were all to familiar to paul he knew them well feelings of embarrassment
21269,8,0,1 it gives shows paul confidence and a lot of answers in life he figured out why mr leonard asked him what his name was even though he read his hall way pass everyday also whenever mr leonard asked paul if he plays basketball he said no so he took him out to the track where he is a suprerstar at mr leonard was just like paul but he wants paul to succsed in life and college
21270,8,1,paul finds out that mr leonard jumped herdles in college and paul now belives that he can do it as well
21271,8,0,mr leonard is a hall monitor that becomes a coach for the school
21272,8,2,he was suprised in fact he pulled out the document about mr leonard's accomplishment and showed it to him it confuses paul because mr leonard didn't seem happy about seeing the printout it turned out that mr leonard was a great at hurdles but wasn't the best student because he couldn't read
21273,8,1,the information makes paul relize that mr leonard is like him in many ways and that he must try hard to do his best
21274,8,1,the background information on mr leonard helped paul realize things about him he also realizes that mr leonard is just trying to be his friend because they have been through the same stuff when paul understands that mr leonard is a cool guy he lightens up and accepts him
21275,8,2,paul has sympathy for mr leonard because they both have problems with learning they both have struggled with the obstacle of learning how to read paul reacts in a caring way when he finds out mr leonard struggles with reading paul decides to take mr leonard to the reading center to help him learn how to read he does this because he is returning a favor mr leonard helped him come out of his shell with hurdling so it was only fitting that paul would help him out with reading
21276,8,2,the effect that has on paul is it makes him feel empathetic towards mr leonard paul understands how mr leonard feels with being one of the only people around who has trouble reading the fact of how mr leonard explains how hard it was to accomplish homework made paul feel a connection of similar problems that's because paul also has had to struggle to get his homework done plus this makes paul understand how he could turn out if he didnt learn adequate reading skills to not flunk out like mr leonard
21277,8,2,the background information paul found out on mr leonard were familiar to him he knew what it felt like to not be able to read to feel embarrarssed about being called and not knowing an answer everyone knew the information he found inspired him to help mr leonard learn to read the way mr leonard trained him to for jumping hurdles on the track team
21278,8,1,it encourages him to teach mr leonard how to read
21279,8,2,the background information that paul finds about mr leonard allows him to empathize with and understand why mr leonard is helping him he realizes that mr leonard knows what paul himself is going through and decides to help mr leonard just as mr leonard helped him
21280,8,2,when paul gets the infornmation of mr leonard from the url paul is quite amzed that mr leonard was an amzing track athlete mr leonard broke records and won the 400 meter national title and paul dosnt understand why he is a hall moniter that is until mr leonard confeces that he cannot read after that moment paul tells mr leonard that it is his time to learn
21281,8,2,mr leonard was a bad reader in high school and in college mr leonard had friends help him with his work in high school and then in college he had a tutors to help him but it was still hard for mr leonard to keep his grades up in college mr leonard doesn't want paul to go there the same thing so he helps him with track and feild this will help paul try harder to learn to read in middle school
21282,8,0,he is shockt that h dose not no how to read
21283,8,2,it gave paul hope that some day he would be able to read it also helped paul understand that mr leonard could not read so he would help be able to read
21284,8,2,the information that is found on mr leonard is a big impact on paul he see's that anyone can do anything if they have help in high school mr leonard had the same problems he was excellent in sports but his grades weren't as outstanding as his sports were mr leonard was only givin a scholarship based upon his sports not his grades mr leonard then failed out of college and no other college wanted a runner that could't read paul then knew he was in the exact same thing and he wanted to help mr leonard just as he helped him
21285,8,2,that paul realizes that mr leonard was a track star in college that funked out because he couldn't read so paul is surprised cause he found out they were alike in a lot of ways
21286,8,2,paul found out that mr leonard was a star in college and broke records for the 400 hurdles paul later found out that mr leonard was flunked out of college because he didn't know how to read paul related to this because he himself doesn't know how to read and he knows the feeling of embarrassment that mr leonard had paul now wants to return the favor and help him to learn how to read
21287,8,2,paul sees himself in the background information he found about mr leonard paul becomes empathatic towards mr leonard who can not read and in the forty sixth paragraph paul foreshadows that he will teach mr leonard how to read such as mr leonard taught paul how to run in track
21288,8,2,the effect is that paul realizes that he is going ot be just like mr leonard who cant read and flunks out of college but amazing at track and had scholarships so paul says 'c'mon mr leonard ' i said walking back toward school 'it's time to start your training ' this is said to mr leonard to return the favor andfor paul realizing how much help mr leonard has done for him
21289,8,1,paul find out that mr leonard was a very good track runner and it made him excited and asked him what happen after that mr leonard then tells him he was not a good student and paul could relate to it paul then realized what he can do for him
21290,8,2,paul learns that he must keep working hard and going to the learning center for help or being a good runner is not going to get you anywhere paul could see the saddness in mr leonard's face about when he would talk about his ruunning and then how he flunked out of college because the work was so hard he couldn't keep up
21291,8,1,the effect about the background information that has on paul was shocking because he didnt know he was a track and field champion he realized he wants to be more like him when paul ask him about his background mr leonard told him that he did but that he didnt do so good in school after mr leonard told him it made paul realized that it he was just like him when he was pauls age
21292,8,1,he see mr leonard differently after he reseaches him on the internet but not in a bad way now he sees mr leonard as someone who understands what he is going through in class when asked to read out loud or not knowing an answer everyone else knows
21293,8,2,when paul reads about mr leonards life at college he realizes that he and mr leonard are the same and that mr leonard is trying to help him get into college and get the life he never had he connects with him and feels sorry for him so paul then helps coach mr leonard in reading which is a lesson mr leonard has yet to learn
21294,8,2,during the story paul gets background information about mr leonard it caused some effect on paul once he knew paul finds out that mr leonard was a college fresham who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records for the school but like paul he had a really hard time in school and had noone to help him so he flunked out it had an effect on paul because paul had a hard time in school too but it made him realize that if he has help and tries his absolute best then paul could do really well in school and become better and better at hurtles
21295,8,0,well he didn't know what to think about he had all these questions to ask mr leonard he had asked him why he hadn't told him about this and that he was pretty much the best runner on the team he had asked why he had stopped running mr leonard simply replied 'i was a good athlete but not a good student '
21296,8,2,the effect that the background information of mr leonard had on paul was that he was surprised because mr leonard hadn't told him anything about it let alone mention it when paul had found out that mr leonard flunked college because he had reading problems and the homework was to hard for him to understand he knew that it was his turn to help improve mr leonard's reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling
21297,8,2,it shows who he was really training with when he did not realize it before if he would have known mr leonard was a former hurdle runner who ran state he might have felt bad if he did not do good one day then he realized mr leonard helped so he should help him with his reading
21298,8,0,he is sad he remembers back when he was doing that in highschool he tells paul about how he use to couldnt read
21299,8,1,when paul finds out about mr leonard's background he begins to understand how it relates to him and not being able to read he finds that the emotions in mr leonard's words were all to familiar they both felt embarrassment and mr leonard gave him time to excel in something which was the track hurdles
21300,8,0,paul now feels that he can still make achieve his goals even if he cant read seeing that mr leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter heurdle at the nationlas made paul realize that anything is possible
21301,8,1,when paul finds out about mr leonard's background paul can relate well to him paul realize's that mr leonard had given up his own time to help paul with track and now paul says it's his turn to help mr leonard
21302,8,0,their are many effects that paul recieves after learning about mr leonards past after hearing mr leonards past story paul believes now that he needs to work hard at learning how to read he also finds information about mr leonard being a college freshman athlete who won records and hurdled in the national race this effected paul because he didn't understand how after college he became a hall monitor he was so successful mr leonard explained to him 'i was a good athlete but not a good student we had no learning centers in our school i relied on friends to help me get by but even then the work was always too hard ' this impacted paul into teaching mr leonard about high school and decided to step up 'c'mon mr leonard it's time to start your training '
21303,8,1,paul is suprised at what he finds because lenard didnt tell hima nyhting about his past and paul found out for him self
21304,8,1,it makes him feel that he owed mr lenard so he is willing to help him read after mr lenard helped him with the track
21305,8,2,paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too paul finds out that mr leonard can't read just as paul can't he decides that since mr leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach mr leonard to read
21306,8,2,paul was not expecting to find out something so interesting about mr leonard the next day after finding the information about mr leonard he asked him about it mr leonard did not seem to excited and happy when he saw what paul had even though he felt embarrassed by the past he still answered paul after listening to mr leonard explain his past he felt familiar with the feelings paul felt inspired he then asked mr leonard to come with him so paul could then help mr leonard just like he done for paul
21307,8,1,he has always looked up to mr leonard so when he found out all the things that had happen to himin college i think at first he was shocked but then he heard more paul had kind of realized that mr leonard was like him when he was his age i just think it make paul and mr leonard closer
21308,8,0,the background information on mr leonard is like how he was good at track in college and he actually flunks out of college which there for he can't do track and field anymore
21309,8,1,it has an effect because paul does not want to lose a scholarship if he gets one
21310,8,0,he doesnt want to be like mr leonard and be good at a sport then fail school
21311,8,2,paul can relate to how mr leonard feels he has felt the same way before and still does in school in a way the two are very much alike in more than one way both are very well runners but fail to excel in school this makes pual want to help himself and mr leonard by putting mr leonard through a different type of training reading
21312,8,1,he is very surprised he is like him he is kinda mad he didnt tell him about himself when he learns that he was good at track he is amazed and doesn't know what to think it's like he didnt even believe him at first he is amazed to see how far he has come
21313,8,0,mr leonard used to be a track coach
21314,8,1,the background information on mr leonard about him being a good athlete was shocking to paul as mr leonard went on about his college life paul finds out that mr leonard is remedial to reading also they have so much in common because they both got put last in every thing and no one wanted them because of there remediation
21315,8,2,paul towards the end of the story is informed that mr leonard was a college track star mr leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading he also told him he never learned and was kick out of college becasue of his lack of reading skills this allowed paul to see that him and mr leonard were similar mr leonard effected paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle
21316,8,1,the effect the information has on paul is that he is just like mr leonard he relizes that mr leonard is trying to help him be the best he can be he relizes that he can over come his reading problem and can learn to read just like he has learned to do the hurtles
21317,8,2,paul learned about mr leonard from the website that the track coach had written down for him the website gave paul some background information on mr leonard and this helped paul relate to mr leonard's situation as a fellow student who could not read the information also made paul feel more emotionally attached to his trainer as in paragraph 45 where he knew the feelings of embarrassment the background information had an emotional effect on paul that helped him relate to mr leonard
21318,8,2,the effect that mr leonard's background has on paul is that he knows the feeling and feels really bad for him paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read now paul wants too help mr leonard learn how too read
21319,8,1,the background information on mr leonard shows paul that even those who struggle have the gifts to be great at things before the background information is given paul failed to see the connection that he had with mr leonard after paul learns more about mr leonard's past he realizes the similarities between their situations and can connect the reasons mr leonard is helping him
21320,8,1,when paul hears mr leonards background information he starts to understand why mr leonard helps him also he kinda connects with mr leonard because he met and adult thats is and was in the same place that he's in they both had the same feelings when it came to reading
21321,8,1,paul began to realize how much his teacher mr leonard and he had in common paul was just now learning why this man had came to him in the first place he couldn't possibably know what mr leonard wanted with him so paul was in surpirse with him or maybe a little disapointed that he wasn't giving the information or the insight on his mentor
21322,8,2,during the story the reader gets information about mr leonard's track records paul now knows that mr leonard was once a wonderful track star and he is now helping paul become better the background information that has the greatest effect on paul is that mr leonard has a reading problem just like him mr leonard helped paul to become better at hurdles now paul wants to help mr leonard become better at reading
21323,8,2,in the story paul finds out mr leonard was a famous track runner in college then also finds out that he flunked out because he couldn't read it makes paul feel like he can relate to someone he even says 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar ' as if he knows exactly how mr leonard feels
21324,8,2,the infromation that paul finds out makes him feel sorry for mr leonard because he has felt the same way because he has trouble reading also this is why at the end of the story paul decides to help teach mr leonard how to read
21325,8,2,it effects paul because he can relate to mr leondard's story bad reading skills trained to get good at track etc in a way i think it motivates paul to become good at track but also focus on getting into a good college and using the learning center to get his reading to a better level
21326,8,2,mr leonard's background information effected paul by making him realize that he and mr leonard are similar this is because both have stuggled with reading paul can relate to mr leonard because in pargraph 45 paul references a time when he was too embarresed to answer in class because he couldn't read aloud the answer
21327,8,2,the background information he recieves from his track coach to research about mr leonard gives paul a whole new way to look at mr leonard paul discovers that mr leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at natuionals he discovered he broke records and asked mr leonard about his past life the information paul soon recieves from mr leonard has a great impact on him this is so by mr leonard also not being able to read like paul although they didn't have service learning centers back then therefore paul decides to help mr leonard begin to start reading
21328,8,2,during the story paul finds out about mr leonard's past as a college hurdler paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well he felt that it was fair to help mr leonard after all mr leonard had helped paul discover that he could excel in hurdles paul then led mr leonard back to the school with the intent to teach mr leonard how to read
21329,8,2,one effect that learning about mr leonards track history had was giving paul the idea to help mr leonard to read since mr leonard helped paul paul wants to help mr leonard knowing his past could have also given paul a reason to excel in track since mr leonard failed out of college although being an excellent althelete paul might want too prove himself to mr leonard and himself that he can succeed also if paul succeeds mr leonard does too since he taught paul everything
21330,8,0,mr leonard is a classic exsampel of a person who is focast on his sport and not on his grades only to find out later in life that he needed the grades more than the sport
21331,8,0,you can be great at things but you should never give up on things that you struggle on like the hurdle the first time paul did them
21332,8,2,mr leonard is kind of like paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and mr leonard wants paul to succeed in life he wants paul to have the oppurti unity that he didnt
21333,8,2,paul thinks of himself as not as good as evrybody else because he can't read well and at first didn't play any sports he seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades paul learns that mr leonard was a great athlete but didn't know how to read this makes paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete this seems to make paul feel better about himself and helps him decide to encourage mr leonard to start learning to read
21334,8,1,i belive that the background information that paul found out about mr leonard drove him to be better and live up to his dreams paul wanted to learn how to read and be better at sports but without and education he would not be able to go into colloge and be better at the sports he wanted too be in
21335,8,0,he went to college and was a big athlete and broke the records but mr leonard didn't graduate because he couldn't read
21336,8,1,well he learns that this weird hall guy or whatever is really a famous track runner and that he couldent read also this in turn shows that if the narrator learns to read and tries hard that he can do the same but without the flunking college thing also at the end akes him want to return the favor in a way for all the training that he gave him for some reading lessons i guess
21337,8,2,the background information made paul wonder why mr leonard was a hall monitor mr leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles and broke school records for it paul was surprised to hear how mr leonard couldn't read that he flunked out of college because he was never learned how to read
21338,8,2,paul is very suprised that mr leonard had not told him about how he was a college track star paul asked him 'why didn't you tell me about this'
21339,8,2,when paul found out that mr leonard did hurdles in collage 38 ran 400 meter hurdles at the nationals he was very enthused
21340,8,0,the background information about mr leonard when he was a freshman in collage is similar to what is wrong with paul paul has troubles reading and so does mr leonard paul is a rare child that get chossen last in every sport mr leonard was one of those kids in school because he couldnt read so everyone choose him last in every sport mr leonard came cobncerned when he stopped paul in the hallway at achool and asked him where he was going when paul said the kearning center because i dont know how to read both of them were tired of being choosen last in everything no matter what it was
21341,8,0,he probably didn't know that mr leonard ran track and broke many records he had to keep that a secret from paul so his hopes wouldn't come crashing down just because he couldn't read he didn't want that to happen to paul
21342,8,0,he knows how it feels to be left out because of his inability to read or know the right questionhe relizes all of this when mr leonard says that 'no school wanted a runner who couldn't read'
21343,8,1,that mr leonard is a good and talented athlete but a very poor reader paul knows the feeling of not knowing how to read finding out about mr leonard pushes paul to read and work hard
21344,8,1,it effects paul because now he realizes that to get into college he has to do well in school he knows this now because mr leonard dropped out of college because he couldn't make the grades even though he had scholarships
21345,8,2,when paul received information about mr leonard he was shocked he did not know that he was a record breaking track runner or that he did not finish track and for that matter collage
21346,8,2,the background information that paul gets from mr leonard helps motivate him it might make paul really work on his reading even though paul is still young his running ablities may get him to also get a scholarship like mr leonard and for that he wouldn't want to lose his scholarship because of his grades either you can tell by that from when he tells mr leonard 'c'mon mr leonard it's time you start your training '
21347,8,1,when paul realizes that mr leonard was a star athlete he questions what happend after that mr leonard states 'but not a good student' 42 by saying this paul realizes that even if you are good at one thing does not mean you shouldnt try anything else mr leonard should have tried in school and paul should have been extending his boundries and comfort zone also it taught paul that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses
21348,8,0,pau is a trsck player in high school still he's trynna get improvement on his track so he can win turnments also he's a very fast runner to
21349,8,2,i will write about why i feel that what paul found out about mr leonard effects him in anyway i think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teacher coach when he told mr leonard about the url he reccived mr leonard told paul about his past thats why i think that what paul found out about mr leonard effects they basically have the same issuses in their lifes another reason why i feel like it effects paul is because paul can relate to mr leonard and paul can understand how he feels paul and mr leonard have the same issuse with reading and paul feels since he is learning how to read he can teach help mr leonard at reading also
21350,8,1,it makes paul feel like he needs to help mr leonard on his reading
21351,8,0,he takes paul to different places to see what hes interested in and he found it by going out on the track
21352,8,2,the background information paul gets on mr leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner because paul like mr leonard can not read very well and doesn't want to end up dropping out of college like mr leonard did
21353,8,1,the background information had a great effect on paul it did because paul had not realized who mr leonard was and wanted to know more when mr leonard told him about his college struggles and his ability to not read well paul felt like he could help in the end mr leonard helped motivate paul to try hurdling just like paul helped motivate mr leonard to learn to read for the first time this effected paul by helping him gain a new friend and trainer
21354,8,1,mr leonard's background information explained that he was a hall monitor whom everyone obeyed and never thought about anything else this kind of reputation encouraged paul to simply and blankly do as mr leonard told him it even encouraged paul to obey mr leonard on something as strange as being told to run hurdles on the track field
21355,8,2,when paul learns of mr leonard's past he is encouraged because mr leonard could not read but still broke records in track paul also want to return the kindness mr leonard has shown him so paul is going to teach mr leonard how to read
21356,8,0,the effect that the background information has on paul is that it makes paul more sensitive to why mr leonard has been pushing and training him
21357,8,0,it tells the reader qbout him as well as adding aditions to the story
21358,8,2,throughout the story there are times when you suspect that mr leonard is just like paul when they are at the track and mr leonard asks for pauls name is a good sign that mr leonard cannot read either mr leonard sees in paul the likeness and commoness that they share the effect it has on paul is the support he gets from someone just like him paul can finally believe he can be great at something and that trying hard is not just a waste of time mr leonard wants to help paul out but the only way for him to help is if paul lets him paul may not know exactly what mr leonard went through right off the bat but little by little paul finds out and it motivates paul to be a better person athlete and harder worker
21359,8,1,the background information about mr leonard helps paul believe that he can get better in track knowing that mr leonard was a college hurdler
21360,8,1,paul was disapointed with mr leonard paul showed this by saying 'why didnt you tell me about this ' after paul finds this out it incourages him more to jump hurdles and have him as a coach and train him paul wants to do better then mr leonard
21361,8,2,paul can't read and neither could mr leonard so when mr leonard starts training paul he doesn't tell him his story because he doesn't want him to discouraged and stop when paul does find out his story he asked about it mr leonard explained it to him and inspired paul to help him at the end of the story paul takes mr leonard to his reading class and says 'it's time to start your training ' since mr leonard helped paul he returns the favor
21362,8,2,paul realizes that mr leonard has trouble reading just like him also paul understands why mr leonard wanted to help him be good in a sport that he liked because mr leonard didn't want him to be left out the same way he was when he was in college
21363,8,2,paul does research and realizes that mr leonard was a college hurdler who broke records in only his freshman year when he questions mr leonard what happened to him leonard tells him that he flunked out because he could not read 'i lost my scholarship and flunked out no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read' this touches paul because he cannot read either it makes him feel much more comfortable around leonard now that he knows they both have experienced similar 'hurdles' in life
21364,8,2,the background information about mr leonard that paul heard was touching to him he knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment an example of how paul knew those feelings where when he gets called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer that everyone else knew i think paul could really relate to mr leonard and also so could mr leornard relate to paul since mr leonard taught him a lesson and helped him out he wants to teach him how to read
21365,8,0,when paul recieved the background information he had questions for mr leonard paul wondered why mr leonard didn't tell him that he was a college track superstar therefore paul asked mr leonard that exact question the next day
21366,8,0,the information paul found could have discourage him as well as him feeling betraded an lied to by mr leonard just by paul printing something out an even showing it to him showed it bothered it alot
21367,8,1,paul was shock to discover that his caoch was the best runner in college his freshman year paul didnt know the reason why he didnt know about mr leonard achievement when paul discovered what happen he was sad now paul wants to read more so he can be better and become just like mr leonard
21368,8,0,when paul figures out what happen to mr leonard when he was in high school and college showed him that they were both alike he believed that mr leonard was trying to show him that anything is possible
21369,8,2,he highly apriciates what mr leonard has done for him now knowing mr leonard has the same problem as he does he wants to help him out just like mr leonard helped him
21370,8,2,during the story when paul recieves the information about his coach mr leonard he has mixed feelings he is some what shocked and paretially confused at first this assumption is made through paul asking questions about mr leonards college days his feelings of shock and awe are expressed just through his first question ' why didn't you tell me about this ' however after mr leonard explains his journey in college to paul he feels as if he knows what he hads gone through paul ultimately feels like he owes mr leonard and deciedes to 'train' him
21371,8,1,the effect that the background information that paul is provided with is that paul realizes that if he tries hard he can become successful when the highschool coach gives paul the opportunity to get information on mr leonard he takes it paul then confronts mr leonard to ask why he did not go on to do greater things mr leonard then tells paul that he had learning issues like him and encourgages paul to try his best so he does not end up like mr leonard
21372,8,1,he weent and got his records and oictures and showed him which made him want to help mr leonard
21373,8,0,that you can do anything if you put your mind to it and you dont have to be smart to do big things in life
21374,8,0,the background information that paul finds about mr leonard has an effect on him he didn't know at the beginning that he was being trained by someone who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals mr lenonard didn't want to tell paul at the beginning because he thought that if he had told him he wouldn't want to train or try something new however if paul had known things may have been better or would of had a better outcome when he was training the saying 'don't judge a book by it's cover' has meaning here mr leonard is the book and just because he's the hall monitor doesn't meant that he didn't have a successful past paul getting to know mr leonard was a way for him to become someone
21375,8,2,paul is surprised because he never knew that the guy whos been helping and motivating was once an college track star
21376,8,0,it kind of shows him what kind of person mr leonard was back then
21377,8,2,paul is effected by finding out mr leonard's backround as a star in track is paul becomes inspired to do well in track just like mr leonard
21378,8,1,the effect the background information has on paul is to show that they are alike paul does not know how to read and struggles in class by learning mr leonards background information he sees that mr leonard also had a hard time in school and could not read it also helps him understands that he is not the only one and knows that mr leonard understands how paul feels
21379,8,1,that he wanted to help mr leonard with his challenge of reading it said that no other school wanted a runner who could not read so that mr lenord can go to college to complete his goal
21380,8,2,i think that mr leonards' background information has a big effect on paul i think this because before mr leonard actually talked to paul paul had no idea what mr leonards' past life was like in sentence thirty eight paul said this 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records ' this makes me think that paul will try harder at everything he does just because he found out about mr leonards' past
21381,8,1,he begins to understand why mr leonard was so nice to him and that he just wanted paul to do well in track but also do well in school
21382,8,1,he feels like it was too familiar for him and they went through the same stuff now he wants to help him out
21383,8,1,when paul learns about what mr leonard used to be he is suprised you know this by how he shows mr leonard the picture and the printout that the track coach gave him in line 38 but he also feels more conected with him this is shown in line 45
21384,8,1,it makes paul and mr loenard better friends because he was helping him train and he was being very good to him and paul was being good and progressing very well and when he found out about his trainer he wanted to help him just like his trainer helped him
21385,8,0,paul was a great athlete but he cound not read paul didnt know who mr leonard was and mr leonard liked that because he was embarresed of not being able to read when he did find out paul didnt care until he started coaching him and helping him with his sport
21386,8,1,paul is very simpathetic and so he teaches him to do hurtles he tells the nararator that he needs to meet him in the gym at 2 30
21387,8,2,when paul learns about mr leonard's past he's at first surprised and wonders why this was kept from him all this time and why he would go through all the trouble to teach him once he learns that he flunked college because he couldnt read well that encourged paul to work harder at reading and teach mr leonard how to read better just like he taught paul to be a athlete
21388,8,1,once paul discovers mr leonard's background it makes him feel stronger he realizes that he is not the only one who could not read he sees that he is not alone that information pushed paul to strive for the better in the hurdles and at reading he sees that he has more oppurtunities than mr leonard did and decideds to take advantage of them for the better
21389,8,1,paul understand how mr leonard feels because of paul own experiences he is going through in his life paul experiences some of the feeling with mr leonard because when he was in class with the others students he would have feel bad when the teacher calls on him but he didn't know the answer to the question
21390,8,2,the background story of mr leonard is something that is familiar to paul mr leonard had went through school not knowing how to read he had a difficult time throughout high school and college he had nobody to help him paul has help from both his tutor and mr leonard he feels as if all the help leonard has given he should return some of it paul wants to help him just as he helped paul
21391,8,1,the background information paul gets on mr leonard makes him want to help mr leonard because he helped him
21392,8,2,when paul does background check on mr leonard he is very suprised at what he finds paul learns that mr leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship when paul told mr leonard that he knew about he history in track and wanted to know why he did not tell him of his great achivements when paul hears that he flunked school because he could not read paul feels for him because he is in the same situation and knows how it feels
21393,8,0,because he want's him to find out everything about track and field and then he find's out mr leonard was a track and field runner and he broke records in college as a freshman and then he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college and no one wanted a runner that couldn't read so he gave up so he wanted to help paul and so paul wouldn't be like mr leonard when he was a kid so he started training paul after school and getting him in shape for track and field so he can be on the team just like him back in the day
21394,8,0,paul feels mostly happy about this and also has a lot of questions for mr leonard when mr leonard saw that picture of him as a teenager and smiled you could tell he was happy to answer his questions
21395,8,1,paul was working on his hurdling and the high school track coach came up and talked to him paul got a url for the track and field website and the coach said 'do a search for 'grabowski ' which grabowski is the guy that has been training paul to be good at hurdles once paul did his search on his trainer he was surprised about the things that grabowski did
21396,8,2,in what paul says in paragraph 35 we can infer that he is amazed that mr leonard was a track star in high school and confused that mr leonard didn't tell him it also probably suprised him that mr leonard didn't become famous because he couldn't read because earlier in the story he was confused because mr leonard asked his name after seeing his hall pass on multiple occasions
21397,8,2,paul finds out that mr leonard was a college track star that broke many records then a while later paul has a conversation with him mr leonard tells him that he had to drop out because he wasn't a good student this relates to paul because he can't read that well
21398,8,2,paul had the same problem as mr leonard he knew how it felt not to read he wanted to help mr leonard since he helped him
21399,8,0,mr leonard began walking back toward the school then turned and asked
21400,8,1,i think it motivated paul to do better in school and do be the best at track that he could be
21401,8,0,paul thinks that sense mr leonard trained him to become a good reader that he thinks he should go to college and graduate college unlike mr leonard who flunked out because he couldnt read paul was going to the learning center to learn how to read so mr leonard seen he was trying and it made him proud just because you cant read dont mean you cant succeed in life
21402,8,1,its surprises him a lot when he is asking mr leonard why was he hiding that from him
21403,8,2,paul is embarrassed by his reading problems but later he finds out that mr leonard and him are not so different because in mr leonard's past life as a hurdler he struggled with reading too
21404,8,0,after paul learns mr leonard's history paul realizes that mr leonard was motivating him to push harder for his goals mr leonard was not able to read which changed his entire life he is concerned for paul paul then understands that he must overcome his weakness in reading because he doesn't want to give up like mr leonard had
21405,8,0,from the stroy paul has a reading disablility and has a hard time reading in a simmular background mr leonard was a excelling track athlete in the 400 meter hurdels from mr leonard's past he dosen't whant to have someone repeating his failures
21406,8,2,the effect the background information has on paul is understanding paul sees that to be successful that he has to learn to read and if you dont that you miss out on really good oppurtunity's that will never come again paul wants to teach mr leonard how to read so that he isn't embarrassed about not being able to read for the rest of his life
21407,8,1,the backround information effected paul because it made him feel like he can come over any obsticle in life paul came to conclusions that he can achieve anything if he put effort into it once he read on mr leonard background that gave him motivation to accomplish his goals
21408,8,0,mr leonard was a great athlete in school but not a great student mr leonard struggled when it came to school and didn't have the help he needed to be a better student his friends helped him out a little but once he got to college everything got harder mr leonard had problems with reading just like paul mr leonard shows paul that he can be a good athlete just like he was when he was in high school just because paul has a har time reading doesn't mean he cannot be sucessful in sports paul is lucky enough to have tutors and someday paul could run hurdles in college and be able to live out mr leonard's dream
21409,8,1,it shows paul a different side of life also its helps motivate him to keep goin it make s him want to help mr leonard plus its something that paul understands because in a sense he is kind of like mr leonard
21410,8,1,the background information that paul recieves helps him to see why mr leonard was helping him and pushing him
21411,8,1,the background information that paul has recieved is shocking paul had no clue that mr leonard was so good at hurdles paul wonders why that he didn't go pro and didn't finish college out
21412,8,2,the background information mr leonard told paul took an effect on him paul realized that if he tried harder at his reading and at his hurdles he could go to college with a scholarship like mr leonard but graduate it's teaching paul a lesson that your education is what really matters
21413,8,0,he questions him about it he wants to know why he stoped
21414,8,2,when he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes he realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him yet then he finds out that he cant read this discourages him yet brings him to the conclusion that since mr leonard taught him well its time to teach him something
21415,8,2,the background information on mr leonard had a motivating effect on paul because mr leonard had the same problem as paul who was also a great runner
21416,8,0,the effect that the background information has on paul is that whether you are a bad reader or you feel like an outcast you can always be a success in something
21417,8,0,the information has an effect on paul because he has a way of learning how to read and learning things as mr leonard dont no how to do some of the stuff that they have got to do
21418,8,1,when paul learns about mr leonard's past it made him want to work harder in hurdling and in his efforts for reading he said that mr leonard's emotions were familiar to him so now he will work hard to help himself and leonard
21419,8,2,he waas really surprized that mr leonard was a collage athlete and he broke records when mr leonard told paul that he wasnt a good reader he couldnt under satnd why not untill mr leonard explaned to him the situation that the scoots told him not to worry about the grades just worry about the sport and he failed his classes and mr leonard had to drop out mr leonard wants to set a goal for paqul to achevie
21420,8,2,paul realizes that mr leonard feels the same way he does about reading he wants to help mr leonard to become a better reader just like mr leonard is helping him with track
21421,8,2,paul is motivated by the information because mr leonard was a star athelete and has given his time to help his time to help excel at something paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because mr leonard can't read like paul paul is then motivated to invest time in mr leonard teaching him something that he doesn't know how to do
21422,8,2,when paul learns the backgroiund information of mr leonard it motivates him to excel both in track and field as well as in school in addition to motivating paul the backgroiund of mr leonard also inspires him to do well in everything he does and gives him the idea to help mr leonard back
21423,8,1,before paul finds the background information over mr leonard he doesn't really think twice about the fact that he could be more than a janitor after he finds it though he feels compelled to help mr leonard learn to read the parallel at the end of the story between mr leonard helping out paul in the beginning and paul helping him in return shows the reader the impact mr leonard's background information had on paul
21424,8,1,when he learns the background information paul realizes that he understands the feelings that mr leonard's words were having he understood how he was embarrassed that he couldn't read and that he went after something he could excel at that's why paul said he had something he could do for mr leonard
21425,8,1,he knew how he felt because he was in the same situation he helped him get help at the learning center
21426,8,2,paul feels that he can relate to the janator and is glad to know that he is not the only one with the problem of not being able to read verry well
21427,8,0,the background information makes paul curious at first it makes him wonder why mr leonard didn't tell him about his past it made him question mr leonard about why he didn't share the information it also makes him wonder why mr leonard didn't make it any farther with the sport it brought up the conversation between the two of them when paul found out about the whole story behind mr leonards track career
21428,8,0,that mr lenoard was a godo athlete but he didnt do good in school so he got fluncked and he wants to help the narator so that he can do good in school and have a succesful careere
21429,8,1,after hearing the story mr leonard has to say about his past the narrator feels empathy for mr leonard and understands what he went and still is going through the backgrrround story really brought them closer together because it made the narrrator feel like mr leonard isn't so much of a stranger but someone a lot like him
21430,8,2,that paul is totally suprised about the hall monitor mr leonard being a track star in college and being one of the best thats been training him on the track everyday from going to the learnign center during the week and then having mr leonard teach him how to hurtle and train him then mr leonard tells him why he drops out of college from not knowing how to read and that you are lucky that you have a learning center then paul looks at mr leonard and says you have training to do
21431,8,0,he finds out that mr leonard was a college track star and wonders why he didn't tell him about it in the story he asks mr leonard 'why didn't you tell me about this '
21432,8,2,during the story paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star and that he went to college and ran hurdles but he also finds out that mr leonard didn't do well in school so paul can kind of relate to this i think that this helps paul realize that he could be good at something too
21433,8,2,he figures out that mr leonard was a college hurdler which he then asks him why ne never told him and then mr leonard told him that he was embarrased because he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read so paul then realizes why mr leonard took such interest in him after school paul then decides to teach mr leonard how to read
21434,8,2,the background information that paul discovers about mr leonard makes him suspicious of why mr leonard did not tell paul about his past paul finds it odd that mr leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star after finding the background information about mr leonard paul says to him 'why didn't you tell me about this you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records ' paul says this to mr leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments surprisingly paul learns that mr leonard is more like himself then he realized paul discovers one of mr leonards most emabarassing secrets that he has never learned to read either and that his grades were so bad that he flunked out of college paul then realizes why mr leonard asked him his name that first day at the track he was never able to read paul's name on his hall pass after learning about mr leonard's past it motivates paul to work even harder at school and at track it also gives paul the idea to teach mr leonard how to read mr leonard's background information made paul realize that if he worked hard then he would be capable of anything
21435,8,2,in the story paul finds out the mr leonard was a track star in college and that he broke records he also found out that he could not read although he was a great runner when paul finds out this information it gives him motivation to try harder and to work at things that do not always come easy to everyone this motivates paul to work hard in his tutoring and in the learning center it also gives him the motivation to tutor mr leonard at the end of the story he thinks that it is time for mr leonard to learn how to read
21436,8,1,paul feels bad for mr leonard because he never learned how to read but he was a good althete paul gave him the schudule and he could not read it when he was in hight school they did not having a learning center like they did paul is going to teach him how to read
21437,8,2,the background information on mr leonard helped paul uner stand why leonaed trained paul in track
21438,8,2,paul was shocked to find out that mr leonard was a hurdler in college that information motivated paul to be a better hurdler it made the bond that paul and mr leonard shared stronger
21439,8,2,paul realizes that mr leonard is just like him when paul sees who mr leonard really is he is shocked 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles ar the nationals your broke records ' paul now sees that mr lenard did know what he was talking about when he was teaching him to jump hurdles
21440,8,2,paul realizes that mr leonard can't read just like himself so paul now understands why mr l told him to meet him after school paul then realizes what he could do for mr l
21441,8,2,the effect of the background information has on paul is that he is that he can relate to mr leonard the feelings of embarrassment were familiar to him when he was called on to real aloud in class this effects paul because he is more motivated to succeed in something and also help mr leonard in return
21442,8,2,at the beginning of the story paul thinks that mr leonard is just a grumpy man who wants to get kids in trouble then he helps paul learn the hurdles and paul begins to like him when the track coach told paul to search for mr leonard on the internet paul learns that mr leonard has a learning disability just like he does this helps paul to know that he isn't the only one who feels embarrassed about not being able to read paul also realized that mr leonard helped him become so good at something in return paul wants to teach mr leonard how to read
21443,8,2,the information connects paul with mr leonard and shows how they are similar like the 'feelings of embarrassment' it also makes him realize that he helped him excel at something out of his own time which makes paul want to help him read
21444,8,2,the effect that the background information has on paul is that he was so amazed that mr leonard won the 400 meter hurdles and didn't tell him about it the effect really sinks into to paul that mr leonard was just like him paul states 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something ' this means that he is greatful that someone like him would do something like that to help paul achieve something great and right then paul realized that he then needed to return the favor to mr leonard by helping him train again
21445,8,2,paul finds out that mr leonard used to be a track star once he finds this out he wonders why mr leonard did not tell him about his past he asks mr leonard what happened after the race and found out that he flunked out of college because he could not read paul knows what it is like not being able to read so he is willing to help mr leonard as mr leonard has helped him
21446,8,2,paul is amazed at mr leonard when he finds out of his acomplishments as a runner paul also finds out about mr leonards weakness as a reader and wants to help him strengethen that weakness as mr leonard helped paul in his weakness for track
21447,8,0,paul found out that mr leonard broke records as a college freshmen and even went to nationals
21448,8,2,paul is happy an shocked at the same time he didnt know that mr leonard was a track star mr leonard trained paul so now paul wants to train mr leonard to read
21449,8,2,when the track caoch gives paul the url and tells him too look up mr leonard he was shocked to find out that he broke alot of records and was really good when mr leonard told paul the reson why he can't do it anymore is because he didn't know how to read and flunked out of college it reminded paul of himself because he didn't know how to read and goes to a tutor 'hey my friend where do you think your going ' 'learning center' 'why ' because i don't know how to read '
21450,8,0,when paul comes in with background information about mr laonard his coach is initially is reliving his glory days as a young talented athelete but as he continues to tell his story he begins to feel sad in paragraph 41 it says 'mr leonard handed kthe paper back and looked at the fround his brow furrowed his voice cracked as he spoke ' this indicates that paul bringing back this information really had an effect on mr leonard he was embarrased at the fact that he couldn't read but he knew that because paul was a slow reader himself he knew paul could relate
21451,8,0,mr leonard was just like paul he could not read but he could run just like paul mr leonard wanted something out of this kid so he could live his memory through someone else he did not want to paul ot end up like himself he just wmated paul to be the best athlete in track and get good grades so another kid doesnt easte his talent like he did
21452,8,0,the boy who wanted to join the track team is or could be the best it could be some one else thou we will never know for shore
21453,8,2,the background information causes paul to feel closer to mr leonard for example the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to mr leonard also paul now has something else in common with mr leonard a difficulty reading the background information also allows paul to return mr leonard's favor of teaching him to run track paul can now teach mr leonard how to read and do well in school
21454,8,2,the effect that paul recieved from getting information about mr leonard is that paul had felt the same exact way paul knew what he was talking about since mr leonard had helped him greatly with the hurdles he felt as if he should help him how to read so paul took him down to the learning center so mr leonard could know how to read
21455,8,0,he sees that mr leonard used to be a track star
21456,8,0,getting mr leonard's information has a big effect on paul
21457,8,2,paul was surprised that mr leonard was a great hurdler runner and became inspired after mr leonard told him he had to lose his scholarship and flunk out because he couldn't read paul could relate to him by remembering his feelings of embarrassment when he was called on to read and didn't know an answer everyone else knew
21458,8,2,the narrator was beginning to realize that he was good at track when he realized that mr leonard had great success in the 400 meter hurdles but couldn't read paul realized that mr leonard had the same experience he was having paul then wanted to help mr leonard with reading in the same way mr leonard helped him with track
21459,8,2,the background information effects paul because now he knows why mr leonard wants to help him be successful because mr leonard had been a great runner but couldn't read he wanted paul to possess the skills he had in running but he also wanted paul to become a better student and have better opportunities than he did himself since paul knows that now he believes you should pay mr leonard back and help him with what he wasn't good at which is reading
21460,8,0,the backgroung infromation is about him being a hall monotor and enjoying it but when thr track comes up he is a really good high school herdeler and knows what he is doing with paul and the coach and he has a good hurdiling future ahead of him
21461,8,2,i think that the back ground information that paul receives about mr leonard makes paul happy he now feels like he fits in with mr leonard since they share the same problem for example after mr leonard tells paul his story about how he flunked out of college at the end of the story paul decides to help mr leonard learn how to read paul is happy because he fits in with mr leonard and because he can help mr leonard just like mr leonard helped him learn how to run hurdles
21462,8,2,he learns that mr leonard is the same as him ' i was a good athlete' 'but not a good student ' and paul is the same way he can not read and struggles with his homework paul is going to help mr leonard
21463,8,0,paul was extremly affected by the fact that he knew that mr leornard was doing this to help him because he didn't want paul to end up feeling an ambarrassment towards himself later on in life because mr leonard went through the same situations that paul is going through right now
21464,8,2,the background information makes paul feel more confortable with mr leonard he now knows him and mr leonard are more alike than what he thought in the beginning of the story paul thought leonard was just some hall monitor that was crazy about checking passes by the end of the story he realized they have a lot in common as in they both have trouble in school reading and they are both good at hurdles i think leonard became an inspiration for paul to try to succeed and do better than what leonard did
21465,8,2,paul is overwhelmed with the information he finds out about mr leonard 'no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read' says mr leonard paul realizes that mr leonard went through the same stuff that paul is going through paul and mr leonard are the same and paul is surprised
21466,8,2,after realizing mr leonard's story paul appreciates and respects him more for what he did for him he sees mr leonard as someone who is caring towards other people and he wants to be like him when he tells mr leonard that it was time for his training he was going to try and teach him how to read better it effected him in that it made his heart open to making other people confient and happy
21467,8,1,the background information about mr leonard influences paul it helps to give him the motivation he needs to become a remarkable athelete his struggle with reading lowered his self esteem but when he discovered that mr leonard also had struggles paul felt more confident the narrator says ' t he emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me' paragraph 45 when he states this he is informing us that he sympathizes for mr leonard
21468,8,2,paul knows how he feels and how embarrassing that it was when you couldn't read or understand stuff now that paul knows mr leonard's history paul decides to help him by teaching him how to read
21469,8,0,mr leonard flunked out of collage because he couldnt read and no other collages would take a runner who cant read
21470,8,2,the effect the background information has on paul made him astounded that mr leonard was a great track star and had the same experiences as he has paul was happy that he made a new friend in mr leonard
21471,8,0,that mr leonard cant read just like paul and mr leonard was a runner so he teaches paul to run like he did when he was in school
21472,8,0,mr leonard was a hall monitor doing his job helping kids out so that they can read just like helped paul do
21473,8,0,the information about mr leonard led to paul succeeding in hurdles and able to be on the track team mr leonard was a star in college but he still could not read paul knew that he couldn't read but he is able to keep trying due to the learning centers at his school if he learned how to read well enough he may earn a scholarship and run hurdles in college with the proud feeling of being able to read
21474,8,2,paul was astonished of mr leonard's accomplishments saying that he was a college freshmen running the 400 meter hurdles and winning at nationals mr leonard tells paul that he could not read when he was in school which is ironic because paul couldnt either the difference was the paul had a tutor and back then mr leonard had no tutors when he was in school so he had to drop out
21475,8,0,it makes paul quizitive as to why mr leonard had quit running track and field when he puleed out the paper and showed it to him he started to ask mr leonard questions so that way he could comprehend what was happening
21476,8,0,the background information shows that they both have trouble with reading
21477,8,1,he is happy to heara aboout the past achivements od mr leonard it motivates him to want to waorkl hareder and better it made him relize what he could do for mr lenoard buy being a good racer
21478,8,1,after paul learns mr leonard's story it makes him more motivated to overcome his obstacles in life and do his best it inspires paul to be a great athlete like mr leonard was but it makes him realize that having an education is essential if he wants to keep being in track
21479,8,1,during the story we get more and more information about mr leonard this information gives paul a better understanding on why and how mr leonard was able to give him such accurate training tips before the author started to give us information about mr leonard we were along with paul given hints into his past such as 'say whats your name ' when paul revieves all the bacground information all these hints become apparent and he understands why he was being helped
21480,8,2,the background informatin on mr lenord gives him and paul a bond they can relate to each other because they both have trouble reading the background information makes when mr lenord said 'no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read ' paul feels like he is not alone and this makes him motivated to help mr lenord feel good about himself the way he did for him
21481,8,0,he tries to help the kid in the story because he is working hard to make mr leonard happy and proud of him
21482,8,0,oaul gathers background information on mr leonard which tells him a lot about the teacher's past he finds out that he was a great track runner that broke many records he also learns that mr leonard had a terrible academic past and he flunked out of college because he couldn't read
21483,8,0,when paul did his bacground on mr leonard paul then found out that they both had problems with reading it says in the passage that mr leonard had problems with reading in college and flunked out paul had problems too but he started going to a learning center for help and mr leonard too
21484,8,1,when paul learns this he has to find out what happened and when he does he decides to help mr leonard
21485,8,2,paul is shocked by the news he gets more interested in mr leonard he shows mr leonard the picture he pronted out and talksto him like he is shocked paul was surprized by the fact mr leonard cant read and that he was in college paul feels the need to help mr leonard just like mr leonard helped him
21486,8,2,it helps him realize that not only was his trainer a track star but that because he couldn't read he ended up flunking out of college it also motivates him to help mr leonard
21487,8,0,it has at first a confusing effect he could read and he had no learning centers to get help and he ened up fluncking out of college and from there no other college wanted him
21488,8,2,when paul finds the background information on mr leonard he seems to be shocked to find out how well mr leonard was in his college past leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records at the moment when mr leonard tells paul about his own struggles in school that's when he realized how he could help mr leonard back for all the help he gave to him
21489,8,1,he knew how he felt which was feeling embarrassed around others when they had to read in class he thought of things to do for mr leonard and finally came up with something they walked back to school so he could train him try and make him feel better about himself and not focus on getting flunked out of college
21490,8,2,the background information that paul got on mr leonard realated to himself paul wasn't very good at sports and was not at all an athlete and he couldn't read so he had to go to tutoring for help mr leonard was a very good athlete but couldn't read and never got any help so he flunked out of college and lost his scholarship this showed paul that he really needed to keep his head in school and do the best he could possibly do
21491,8,0,the effect that the background information about mr leonard had on paul was that mr leonard was in the same boat as paul paul had a reading problem and the information about mr leonard said that he flunked out of college because he wasn't able to read it shows paul that you have to do your school work and be good at it for you to do what you wish also it shows paul that he is not the only person with a reading disability and you can do anything if you set your mind to it
21492,8,0,that he went to school with paul that mr leonard went to college with pauls dad
21493,8,0,the backround information about mr leonard has an effect on paul because they both have had and do have trouble reading also paul feels like he is left out of sports and is always chosin last in sports so mr leonard decided to coach paul in track
21494,8,2,when paul learns that mr leonard was a college track star who broke records in the hurdles but failed out of college because he couldn't read paul feels sympathetic towards mr leonard the symapthy that paul feels for mr leonard is from self experience with lack of reading skills at the end of the story paul foreshadows that he will help mr leonard with his 'training' or academics
21495,8,0,the effect of the backround information is that the narrator was having trouble in school just as mr leonard did in college it also shows that if you do not work your hardest at what you are doing you will not meet your expectations
21496,8,1,the background information that mr leonard had given paul had really changed paul's life in one respect he felt sorry for his teacher but at the same time he also found inspiration in his teacher's story mr leonard tells how there was no learning center when he was in college he feels confindent that the learning center will help paul he is also glad that learning center is there to help people that are like himself
21497,8,1,it makes him want to do better and wonders why mr leonard didnt tell him about his college years when he finds out he wants to help him in any way possible
21498,8,2,paul was shocked that mr leonard was a track star when he went to high school when mr leonard told paul about him flunking out of college becuase he can not read i think paul relized that school was important and that he wanted to help mr lenard how to read
21499,8,2,it reminds him of himself on how he also has problems reading and that he is trying to do better by going to a learning center
21500,8,1,paul was suprised that mr leonard wasn't good at rading he was shocked when he saw that mr leonard was a college track star but not a good student
21501,8,1,mr leonard and paul were both not very good at in school later mr leonard reveals his college background about having no learning programs and grades not mattering if he was good at sports paul understood the trouble and decided to take mr leonard in to a program just like when he took paul in because he was poor at sports
21502,8,0,the effect on paul was like he was feeling sad for mr leonard beacus mr leonard was a good runner but he did not do very good in school i lost my scholarship and flunked out no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read
21503,8,2,the background information paul gets about mr leonard helps paul to belive in his self paul and mr leonard are just alike neither of them can read very good mr leonard tries to help paul become a better student and suceeds in returning the favor paul then starts training mr leonard so he'll be able to read
21504,8,1,the backgroud information that paul gets about mr leonard shows him that he can acomplish something if he tries for example when paul and mr leonard go to the track and start trianing the boy never thought he was good at anything and he always got rejected ended up he trained with the high school track team
21505,8,2,i think paul was shocked that a hall monitor was a college freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that the hall monitor 'grabowski' couldn't read that good himself so they had something in common
21506,8,2,paul empathized with mr leonard because he knew how it felt to be the slow kid in class and it inspired him to help mr leonard learn to read
21507,8,0,the reader in this story happens to get many gifts pretty much whatever he wants is what he gets there is not one thing the reader didnt get that he didn't want to get
21508,8,2,paul was both surprised and upset about the background information he was surpised because he thought mr leonard was just an average coach but he found out through the background information that he was wrong he was upset because he thought mr leonard trusted him enough to tell him about his past
21509,8,1,after mr leonard pulled out a printout of his old highschool records from track paul seemed to be amazed after mr leonard shared to paul that he was a great athlete but school on the other hand didn't come easy to him he seemed to realize that maybe mr leonard is helping him because they both can relate to eachother in one way or another
21510,8,2,when paul finds our mr leonards past he was shocked paul was shocked because of what mr leonard has been doing for him how he has been helping him through the obstacles in his life how he is trying to get paul to over come them he knows what paul is going through and he knows that nothing not even the small obstacles can stop a person who can't read
21511,8,0,the effect that background information has on paul is that he is not a very good student in school
21512,8,1,the background information helped paul know why mr leonard had helped him build his confidence and give him something he enjoys doing paul relates to mr leonard feelings of embarrassment since they both have trouble reading
21513,8,1,he feels confident in the teachings mr leonard will give him in his sport of choice
21514,8,2,paul is not exactly an average boy he doesn't really fit in and he cannot read mr leonard starts helping him in track once paul got a spot on the track team it was revealed to him who mr leonard really was mr leonard girabowski a track star he broke records and even got a scholarship to college but it was all taken away from him because he could read paul could sympathize with this feeling the embarrassment when he didn't know the answer he was grateful for everything so he decided to return the favor paul was going to teach mr leonard to read
21515,8,1,paul realizes that mr leonard is just like him mr leonard wants paul to understand that branching out will help him in the long run he does not need to be so shy by working hard paul can accomplish anything
21516,8,1,the effect on paul is suprising to him he thought that a hall monitor would have never had a back ground like mr leonard had although shcoked to hear about him through the website paul could relate very much to mr leonard and so could mr leonard thats why mr leonard's gaze softened when paul said he couldnt read
21517,8,0,paul didn't know that mr leonard was a college track and field athlete which affected him in som many ways
21518,8,1,i think after paul read about mr leonard it pushed him harder to run and jump the hurdles for he was also impressing him and he knew if he worked hard at it like he does with his reawding he'll be able to do it better everyday
21519,8,1,the effect mr leonard's background information had on paul was that paul began to feel a connection with mr leonard in the story paul stated that he believed he only did the hurdles at first because he was used to obeying mr leonard however after learning about mr leonard paul begins to see the similarities between them both worked hard and excelled atheletically but had trouble academically these similarities make paul empathetic toward mr leonard and wish to help the man
21520,8,1,paul is somewhat bothered about how mr leonard didn't tell him about him running track i think paul will be more motivated to be on the track team so he can impress mr leonard and show him that he can overcome obstacles
21521,8,0,the background information changes the way the reader looks at mr leonard he sees him now as a great athlete because he broke records in college
21522,8,0,paul now knows why he is trying to train him mr leonard wants someone that was like him in high school do better then him and have a better chance in college not only in college but also in life
21523,8,1,paul is just like mr leonard he is good at track but he can't read i think that it gives him motivation to work hard to learn how to read so he can succeed and keep doing track
21524,8,0,the background information paul finds out about mr leonard seems to discourage him this is evident because when he was asking mr leonard about it he looked down at the ground and his voice cracked he felt that he had no hope since he was starting from scratch and mr leonard was a star athelete in high school and college
21525,8,0,the effect that this information has on paul is tremendous becasue it shows that mr leonard is a person just like him in the story when mr leonard asks paul where he is going and he responds the learning center mr leonard just srugs it off because he knows he has been there another example is when mr leonard asks paul to meet him after school he is trying to hepl him in life lastly mr leonard is discuraged when he is reminded of his past but when paul helps him he feels better
21526,8,0,to let paul now that he has to do his best in school to have funny in sports and keep your grades up
21527,8,2,paul didn't know how to speak to mr leonard because he was an track star and then dropped out of college paul also wanted to help mr leonard because he helped paul with all of his ability that he has now and paul is more outgoing paul got asked by the high school track coach to come and be on his team that's how paul got the information on mr leonard and wants to try and help him to be out of his comfort zone paul was effected by it because he didn't know that mr leonard was an great track star and he just wanted to help him like he did paul
21528,8,0,the reader recieves background information about mr leonard throughout the story the reader knows that mr leonard is the hall monitor and keeps the kids moving shows an interest in students who struggle with school and used to be a track star by being a hall monitor mr leonard is used to telling kids where to go and what to do the kids in return are used to obeying him that's why paul never quit when mr leonard made him do more work because he had been 'conditioned by hearing those words every day ' mr leonard is empathetic towards paul because he knows what it feels like to not do well in school he even admits to paul the he 'lost my scholarship and flunked out' all of these examples give background information on mr leonard
21529,8,2,when mr leonard told paul about his background history paul could relate they both had learning problems paul decided to help mr leonard learn to read since mr leonard helped him train for track
21530,8,2,the background information makes paul feel as though mr leonard understands his problems he says that he knew mr leonard's feelings well because he had often felt them it also makes him feel as though he can give back to him paul decides to teach mr leonard how to read as a way to repay him for his efforts
21531,8,2,when paul learns that mr leonard was a track star in college that ran hurdles and broke records he was stunded paul confronted mr leonard with the printout of web page and said what happend mr leonard responce was 'i was a good athlete but not a good student i relied on freinds to help me but it was too hard' so now paul trys harder in school and on the track
21532,8,2,whenever paul looked up all the acheivments that mr leonard made he must have been humbled to be in the presents of what was a star athlete in paragraph 39 paul seems excited and impressed with all of leonard's success
21533,8,1,the effect that the background information has on paul is that he realizes mr leonard is just like him 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me ' paul is bothered by the fact that they are just a like he wants to do better now that he knows what mr leonard has been through 'c'mon mr leonard ' i said 'it's time to start your training ' paul wants to help mr leonard out
21534,8,1,he is surprised and puzzled that mr leonhard didnt share the information with him he also wants to learn more about him
21535,8,2,mr leonardo's background information relates to paul paul knows what it is like to feel embarrassed when he does not know an answer everyone else knows or when he is called upon to read aloud paul feels that he is similar to mr leonardo and has a desire to help mr leonardo
21536,8,0,it made him fill bad
21537,8,0,well he kinda got this feeling that when the teacher wrote him something on the paper saying url he kinda figure that mr leonard didnt know how to read but mr leonard told him that he was a good runner in that we went to college but when he went to college that he got bad grades and that he feild the hole course and that he didnt now how to read he saying that it was bad for him becasuse it was really hard for to read and that some people didnt understand him and that he felt like it was embarrassing to tell some thats about to be o the team of his that he son't now how to call the plays and when he stand up in front of the class an read a book and there some that he can't answer it and somebody have to do it for him but even thow mr leonard didn't now how to read he was able to help him get threw it now the boy can say that mr leonard was very exsired to him so he would never give up
21538,8,1,i believe that paul was encouraged to see that mr leonard was once a track star and that anyone can really reach their goals if they try hard enough mr leonard showed paul that pushing yourself may get you to where you want to go and in clearing the hurdles and running faster and faster each time paul made that push happen
21539,8,0,in paragraph 44 mr leonard said that his college scouts told him that his grades didn't matter he flunked out of school and no other school wanted a runner that wouldn't read
21540,8,0,they both have an issue with reading and learning well mr leonard was quick to misconstrue why paul was in the hallway until he brought up an obstacle in mr leonards life also
21541,8,2,mr leonard's background infrormation has a similar effect on paul because he is going through the same thing mr leonard is going through paul goes to the learning center twice a week to learn how to read mr leonard was a good athlete when he was in high school but not a good student mr leonard didn't have a learning center back then that would help him with his grades so paul understood how mr leonard felt he felt embarresed i think paul also felt that he wasn't the only one going through learning diableties
21542,8,2,when paul discovers that mr leaonard was a track star and that he could not read i think that he was determined to do better
21543,8,0,the effect of the background information has a very good effect in paul it makes him try to be a better person
21544,8,0,he was confused about why mr leonard didn't tell him and why he kept his past a secret
21545,8,0,it makes him feel proud i know this because the text says 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals '
21546,8,2,the background information about mr leanard suprises paul this is because what he found was this mr leanard used to be a college freshman that broke records on the hurdles he went to nationals and won the 400 meter hurdles paul wasn't aware of this and asked why mr leonard didn't tell paul because he couldn't read and flunked out of college after that nobody wanted a runner that could not read therefore mr leonard could not finish his runnning career this would encourage paul to try hard to learn to read it will show him to never give up and always try your best in life
21547,8,2,the reader gets background information on mr leonard and the effect it has on paul is that he believes he can do it because mr leonard could not read just like him paul believes that he can do it because he knows that mr leonard did it in college even though mr leonard flunked out in college doesn't make a difference to paul because paul believes in himself and believes that he can do this no matter what mr leonard has taught paul alot and paul is not going to give up on running track mr leonard could not read when he was in school just like paul but paul realizes how good of a track runner mr leonard was and he is pushing himself to be just as good as mr leonard was
21548,8,0,mr leonard is a guy who can't read and he uesd to be a good runner for a school be because he can not read he falled but one day he helps a boy to a spot he like to do
21549,8,1,he felt bad and wanted to help him out to by helping him train
21550,8,0,there was a very big effect from the background information given on mr leonard the biggest effect was by mr leonard sharing his past it shows that even if your not good at something dont give up just try even harder mr leonard said ' no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read ' as mr leonard says this he also is showing paul that hey look i was such a good athlete but just because i couldnt read they didnt want me mr leonard did not want him to end up the same way
21551,8,2,when paul learns of mr leonard's background he instantly begins to look up to him in paragraph 38 paul lists his acheivements as a track star later in the story in paragrah 44 mr leonard tells him about how he flunked out of college because he couldn't read very well this was something that paul could relate to he knew how embarassing it could be and he wanted to repay him for all the help he had given paul with the hurdles
21552,8,0,mr leonard have to look at the background of paul because they have the same problem at first paul didn't want to think about it and tell mr leonard to walk back toward school because it was his time to start training him and they helped each other out and paul realized what he did for him they made him feel very embarrassment about it because they would call on him and he didn't want to answer amd knew everybody else was better
21553,8,2,paul is surprised that mr leonard never told him about how great of a hurdler he was when he was younger paul sees that mr leonard went on to college to hurdle and thinks that it was incredible but then mr leonard tells paul that he wasnt a very good reader and flunked out of college because there was no learning center from him to go to for help paul understands how he feels and decides to help mr leonard to read better since he helped him so much
21554,8,2,he was surprised that mr leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage but at the same time he was also curious because he didn't know that mr leonard was a drop out paul asked 'why didn't you tell me about this ' mr leonard said 'i looked good back then didn't i ' then they started talking about the race mr leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage then mr leonard told paul about his school life and that he couldn't read either and that after he was a drop out no other collage wanted him
21555,8,0,paul is not a very good student but he is a very good athlete
21556,8,1,it inspires him to try harder paul now knows that mr leonard had the same problems he has it showed paul that even though it'll take work he can learn to read and overcome that obstical in life
21557,8,1,when paul gets background information on mr leonard he related with mr leonard 'the emotions in mr leonard's were all too familiar to me i knew them well '
21558,8,2,paul felt the same way because he couldnt read either so he decided he could help mr leonard out by training him
21559,8,0,tge effect causes paul to get nerves
21560,8,2,the background information made paul realize how mr leonard feels paul says 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me ' this is stating that paul knows how mr leonard feels and wants to help him just like mr leonard helped paul the background information effected paul by causing him to realize that others feel the same way as him
21561,8,0,well mr leonard was a hallway protrol then he help him
21562,8,2,the background information that paul got about mr leonard effected him because he wanted to help him learn to read just like the learning center is helping paul learn to read paul wanted to help out mr leonard because he was like him he could not read but was a good athlete and paul didn't want to end up like him and he grew close to mr leonard so he wanted to help him
21563,8,0,then hes ilitereatc
21564,8,1,a first he was upset that he didnt tell him then was surprised because he had broken a record then asked more questions about what had happened why he stopped running
21565,8,0,it effects paul because at first that he didn't know that mr leonard was an athlete after paul found out that mr leonard was an athlete that changed paul mr leonard told paul that he wasn't good at reading at all so after mr leonard helped pau out with his problem paul helped mr leonard with his problem
21566,8,0,mr leonard is very encouraging he tells paul it 'was not a bad first effort and 'you'll do better next time ' paul says he gets picked last all the time and is obviously effected by it because it says he didnt want to see more of that treatment out of school therefore mr leonard was encouraging and didn't give up on him this caused him to stick with it and stay confident
21567,8,0,he probaly feels proud but then agin sad at the same time
21568,8,2,the information both shocks him and connects paul with mr leonard they are similar since both of them arent good readers and are good at track paul feels like he can finally emphasize with someone for a change and because of this paul grows to like mr leonard even more
21569,8,1,mr leonard feels bad for being this big track star back in school and paul wants to make him proud
21570,8,1,paul see's that mr leonard is like him in a lot of ways like the fact that they both are embarrased about there school lifes mr leonard had to drop out of college because of his poor grades paul didn't know how to read as quick as the other kids did they also both had to have tutors help them with their school work just to get by
21571,8,0,the background information about mr leonard has a great effect on paul because he was just like him paul was on his way to the learning center because he cant read and mr leonard was a good track player like paul but the problem was that he couldnt read either so mr leonard did not want the same thing that happened to him happen to paul because he knows he had something going for himself until he flunked out of college it would probably make him proud to see paul pick up his mistakes run track and know how to read
21572,8,1,the background information on mr leonard is very powerful it makes paul realize that he has the chance to be good and take the next step it allows paul to get the chance to find help so he can go to college and be successful
21573,8,2,paul realizes that mr leomard is very talented but now is a hall monitor paul is greatful that mr leomard helped him train but feels guilty he is getting all the attention paul wants to help him learn and get better too so at the end paul tells him that 'it's time for you to start training ' paul is now going to teach mr leonard to read in return for him to teach paul to hurdle
21574,8,0,mr leonard tells paul the narrator that he had problems in school but did great on track he wanted to show that you can't be great at everything so easily you have to keep trying and sooner ot later you will accomplish the goal you were reaching for
21575,8,1,the feeling of embarrassment that mr leonard felt and the narator had had the same feelings when he was called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know an answer everyone else knew he like the fact that mr leonard had given his time to help him excel at something
21576,8,1,mr leonard reminds paul of himself
21577,8,1,learning about mr leonard's information effected paul by showing him he is not alone
21578,8,0,it makes paul wan't to succeed more and make mr leonard proud
21579,8,0,in the story mr leonard and paul had started a conversation about if they were a good athlete mr leonard said that he was a good athlete but not a good student when it came to school they didnt have any learning centers in our school he always relied on friends to help him get by even then the work was always too hard then mr leonard had embarrassment feelingd when paul was called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know the answer to the question like everybody else knew
21580,8,1,im assuming that by finding out about mr leonards past it had a great impact on pauls reading problems paul probably thinks that he shoudl try harder on his homework so he doesnt fail college also paul says mr leonards words were to familiar to him they were both embarrassed to not be good at reading

21704,8,2,the effect it had on paul was that the coach could'nt read either and he flunked out of college and he could'nt run track so he did'nt want the same thing to happen to him because paul has a reading problem so he's got tutor
21705,8,1,the back infomation reminds paul of him self
21706,8,2,paul realizes that mr leonard broke high school records in field and track paul also figured out that mr leonard couldn't read since mr leonard had helped paul out with track paul figured he could help mr leonard learn how to read
21707,8,2,when paul finds out about mr leonard i'm sure that he is encouraged to do well simply because now he knows he's being coached by a talented star in his day it's motivation then when he finds out that he can't read as well i feel it motivates him even more because mr leonard was a great track star that flucked college due to the lack of available help paul not just has the training of mr leonard and the track team to help him with track but he also has the help of the leraning center to help him read and he can be successful if he keeps at it
21708,8,2,paul feels that mr leonard should not have hidden that he couldnt read either paul could have helped mr leonard become better at reading during the same time paul was training for huddling the background information helped paul understand where mr leonard is coming from paul feels that they both come from the same problems he might have felt that the two of them can over come the problem together
21709,8,1,when the reader gets the background information about mr leonard he understands that mr leonard was in the same situation as him mr leonard was a good runner and he couldn't read very well just like the reader but the reader was getting help and mr leonard didn't want the reader to end up like he did flunking off because he couldn't read it would be a waste of potential
21710,8,1,paul had almost the same background as mr leonard paul was going threw probems like mr leonard did in school mr leonard told paul that he could do amything only if he tried
21711,8,0,the background information that mr leonard told paul let him know that there may be challenges in life mr leonard didn't make the grades but he got into college just fine mr leonard wants to hep paul because he never got the oppurtunity to be in a learning center
21712,8,0,he feels upset that mr leonard didn't tell paul about his past acheivements
21713,8,1,the effect that has on the paul that mr leonard was a very good track runner in college paul didn't know mr leonard got put out of school because he didn't have grade's mr leoard didn't wanna tell paul he got put out of school because of his grade's paul found out that mr leonard can't read paul decdie to teach mr leonard how to read
21714,8,1,after paul learns background information about mr leonard he realizes that they both have more in common than paul thought paul knows the emotions mr leonard went through like 'feelings of emarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew' lines 46 48 because of the fact that paul knows what mr leonard has gone through paul now realizes that mr leonard has given up his time to help paul and paul knows now that he can help mr leonard as well
21715,8,2,i believe that it had a motivational effect on him i say that because he did'nt want paul going through life feeling discouraged like mr leonard did he knew what it feels like to not be able to read and thats embarrassing another reason why i believe this had a movtivational effect on him was because he wanted paul to have confindent in himself and over the obstacle of not nbeing able to read
21716,8,0,paul got background information about mr leonard from when he was a college student and was involved in hurdling paul was always chosen last for a basketball team so mr leonard to paul to the track to train him for hurdlers i believe mr leonard saw himself as paul in college mr leonard couldn't read and i'm sure he felt like an outsider therefore paul felt like an outsider when it came to being chosen last for a team everyday
21717,8,2,paul finds out the mr leonard was a track star in his running days mr leonard tells him 'i was a good athlete but not a good enough student we had no learning centers in our school 'this influenced paul to work harder at both track and reading he also wanted to assist mr leonard in reading
21718,8,1,the information about mr leonard that paul finds is probably effected him in a way that he didn't understand why mr leonard wouldn't tell him that he used to be an amazing at hurdleing he probably felt confident know that someone else had been through what he was going through paul might have even felt greatful that someone had wanted to help him do something he thought he could never do
21719,8,1,it encourages him to really work hard and make mr leonard proud and try to accomplish the things that mr leonard couldn't
21720,8,1,when paul realised who mr leonard was he related his situation to his mr leonard and paul were in the same boat only mr leaonard was in college and flunked out when mr leonard asked him his name at the track paul thought it was weird only because he got stopped 2 times a week and he didn't remember his name so when all of the peices to the puzzle were put together he realised he didn't want to go down the path mr leonard had gone down
21721,8,2,the background information given allows paul to connect to mr leonard both paul and mr leonard had reading disabilities in paragraph 6 paul tells mr leonard that he can't read and that is why he is going to the learning center later on in the story paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star in hurdles as well paul asks why mr leonard didn't tell him when he was coaching paul mr leonard then tells paul in paragraph 44 lines 4 5 that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read this connects paul and mr leonard paul then decides to help mr leonard with his reading
21722,8,0,paul learns that mr leonard is not vary smart the narrator tells mr leonard that it is time for his training what means that paul is going to teach him to become better
21723,8,0,the effect that the background information has on paul is it pushes him to stride forword and do better it also helps him realize that even thou you can't read you can still accomplish great things with mr leonard that great thing was breaking the 400 meter hurdles records at nationals
21724,8,2,the background information we learn about mr leonard is a huge twist on the story by learning that mr leonard was a poor reader we know that he and paul have the same problem paul who we know can't read turns out to be a great athlete but can't read mr leonard who was a tremendous college athlete was a poor reader as well mr leonard wants to help evolve paul into coming a better student athlete he can't rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college
21725,8,2,when mr leonard told paul about his background that he flunked out of college paul was very understanding paul was undergoing the exact same thing that mr leonard was paul couldn't read paul knew how it must have felt for mr leonard to explain his past to paul for example in paragraph 45 the narator paul says 'i knew them well feelings of embarassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew ' in that quote paul explains that he went through the same thing and feelings that mr leonard was going through when he told paul that he flunked out of college paul understood clearly what mr leonard felt
21726,8,1,when paul finds out about mr leonard's past it makes him curious as well as determined knowing the man who was coaching him was a star athlete he also sees that education is just as important as sports and working hard will get you places just like mr leonard worked hard at sports it also gave paul motivation to be as successful as mr leonard but this time he could pass college while learning how to read
21727,8,1,paul ggets excited to hear about his past but then begins to feel sad for mr leonard as he soon finds out about what happened to him in college by understanding that he needs to work harder than what he is doing right now to be outstanding
21728,8,0,during the story paul gets background information about mr leonard when the high school track coach gives paul the url for a track and field website paul learns that mr leonard was a college track runnner who won nationals and broke records paul also learns that mr leonard lost his scholarship and flunked out of college
21729,8,0,paul doesn't like on how they are getting a background check on mr leonard
21730,8,1,the background information not only inspires paul to do his best for track and field but inspires him to motivate mr leonard he also learns that an education is a key part of being successful in the future he suggests that grabowski 'start his training' once again and relive his dreams
21731,8,2,the background information has a positive effect on paul because it reminds him of himself mr leonard couldn't read and neither can paul they both are embarressed about the things that has happened to them the background information brings paul closer to mr leonard and gives not only mr leonard to help paul but paul a chance to help mr leonard
21732,8,0,i think it means just because you cant do one thing does'nt mean you cant achieve something else just as great paul wants to help mr grabowski like he helped him
21733,8,1,when mr leonard was in high school he was just like paul he found it hard to read and felt discouraged and embarressed when called on in class to read aloud an exerpt paul has an advantage the remedial reading program paul goes twice a week and continues to learn to read mr leonard did not have this luxury and in time flunked out of college mr leonard sees himself in paul and strives to make paul an exceptional hurdler when paul discovers mr leonard's past he feels a connection between them paul realized this man had given time to help him and he wanted to help mr leonard as well because paul knows of mr leonard's past it has brought them a stronger friendship and it has probably inspired paul to become a great hurdler
21734,8,2,he understands the mr leonard and paul weren't so different because they both had trouble reading and didnt think they needed help
21735,8,0,mr leonard feels that paul will not be able to get any where without being able to read
21736,8,1,when paul get the background information fro mthe web site about mr leonard he was surprised but then made sense of it because mr leonard asked his name after seeing paul's hall pass for 2 weeks paul is also understanding because her knows how it is to be like mr leonard because he is in the same situation as mr leonard
21737,8,0,mr leonard didn't do well in college evidence' things were different back then ' he replied 'the college scout's told me that my grades didn't matter that i'd have tutors to help me but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked out no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read '
21738,8,0,the story talks about his background because
21739,8,0,it tells paul that he can do something that is worth his time and effort it explains to paul that he is capapble and he just has to start learning now because college is just as hard if not harder
21740,8,0,in this story mr leonard helps paul to overcome 'hurdles ' mr leonard takes paul to a track and shows him how to practice for an activity over time paul gets very good at these hurdles for track and confront the track coach to join come to find out mr leonard was a track star himself he pushed paul to get better at reading and to then get better at doing something he wasnt used to but could enjoy paul then can exceed in school while doing an activity
21741,8,2,when paul learns mr leonard's background information he feels connected to him paul now realized that mr leonard was just like him in the fact that they both have trouble reading paul sees mr leonard as a motive to get bettter at reading and to persue hurdling in track and field paul also sees this as a way to help mr leonard just like he had helped him
21742,8,0,the information on mr leonard is about his records in collage and how he failed in collage and so mr leonard wanted to help paul so now mr leonard is training pual to run in track and feald
21743,8,2,that background information about mr leonard shocks paul paul then wants to know how mr leonard went from being a track star to a hall monitor by pressing on 'well what happened after that ' this background information then turned out to be a lesson for paul about recieving a good education and not giving up mr leonard never had help with reading and he failed college
21744,8,1,the effect that the backgroung information had on paul was life changing he finally found someone who had his same condition that was actually pretty good at something now i see motivation in paul and he's sees it in himself as well he realizes that was just a minor setback for a major comeback
21745,8,1,the backround information about mr leonard is essential in this story the effect paul has on mr leonard's backround is mr leonard was a track star and that is what paul wants to be with mr leonard as an example paul realized he needed to get good grades to be successful in college
21746,8,2,he wants to help mr leonard because mr leonard helped him through the obstacle that he was facing in his life at that time
21747,8,0,the short story is a pome you can tell by the number's on the side and how it riten
21748,8,2,in gifts the effect the background has on paul is that when he hears mr leonard say he couldn't read paul says that he will teach him paul does not feel sorry for him just simply wants to help him as his friend had helped paul
21749,8,1,he realizes that mr leonard is a lot by him with his reading disability and how its embarrassing when they are called on to read aloud also he feels greatful for the time he has helped him to excel in something
21750,8,1,the backround information makes mr leonard and paul become even closer because both couldn't read paul understands what mr leonard went through and he is willing to help him

23018,9,2,the author divided this article into sections the begining of the article is just an introduction that is suppose to grab the reader's attention and help them to become intrested the next section 'what is space junk ' is the foundation of the rest of the article it is included to help explain in a simple form what is space junk why it is floating and how it was placed up there the next section 'crash course' is includede to explain how the objects could possible be dangerous and to tell what has happened in the past that has proved them to be a negative and danger 'little bits but a big deal' is to explain how little objects can actually have a very large impact on the satellites it significanfies how it doesn t matter what size the object is it still creates a large problem the author probably wrote this article this way because he wanted to but it into the sinplest form and explain all parts of the question
23019,9,0,he has paragraphs for each one
23020,9,2,in the introduction the author grabs the reader by making surprising statements he then however changes to a more serios tone to let the reader know that space junk is a significant matter he explains 'what is space junk' by reviewing the history of satellite orbitals and explaining how pieces of satellites have broken off and gone into orbitals he then explains how satellites crash and how debris is broken off finally he explains the importance of space trash and finding a solution to the problem
23021,9,1,the author organize the article by putting each name by order in evey new paragraph the author has a new title
23022,9,0,i think that the author organization is kind of messy but kind of not in the beginning he starts off with a wild introduction but that made me interested in reading it then he goes off talking about different topics making it pretty organized because atleast he has a title to make the readers know that they are going to learn something different
23023,9,1,the author organizes this article by starting with information and the first satellites and the harm of what a satellite could do when it malfunctions and cannot be repaired he then explains the risk of a satellite colliding with another as well as the harmful effect of the debris from the satellites has on space the author concludes this article by explaining the fact that space will soon become to crowded causing a potential threat in the future
23024,9,1,this article is devided into an intoduction followed by four paragraphs of supporting information a problematic supposition and finaly an alternate route suggestion and a summery of the article as a whole
23025,9,1,the author has certain titles throughout the article to show what the topic is going to be
23026,9,2,the author first grabs our attention with phrases that include exclamation points as he moves to the body of the article we are informed of what space junk is and how it has gotten to where it is the author then tells of how dangerous this space debris is to spaceships as well as the orbital paths of other things out in space he tells that although space junk may be small in size it has huge consequences in the end
23027,9,1,the author organizes the article so that the introduction is about the history the body paragraph shows examples and the conclusion explains the significance of taking care of our space trash
23028,9,1,the author organizes the article in sections the sections help place specific topics into categories this allows the reader to fully understand what the author wants the reader to know the author creates four sections each section has a different topic all under the same subject these topics provide a wide range of information about space junk the author also organizes the first section with a light conversation then the author gradually becomes more serious by talking about the history of space junk
23029,9,2,the author organizes this article by giving a description telling how it happens and giving the after effects in the first paragraph the author mostly explains what space junk is and how it gets there the author writes about earth's satellites how they get there and what they do the second section explains the process of how satellites crash into eachother it gives an example of when earth and russia's satellites crashed and how they were completely disabled and useless making them 'space junk' lastly the third section tells the aftermath it talks about the microscopic particles and how they are hard to detect even with our technology
23030,9,0,the author organizes this article very well the introduction is attention grabbing and it makes people want to read the entire thing to learn about what is going on out in space there is a lot of information in the article but it is organized in a way that makes it interesting to read
23031,9,0,the author starts off with a startatling sentence then starts to talk about how they are made and what they are made from he tells how long they have been around he tells some problems with them as well
23032,9,1,he starts with a weird fact to get the reader's attention then he adds some old history of space junk after that he puts in information about satellites colliding then to end it he proposes ideas to stop space pollution
23033,9,1,he goes from the things that cause space accidents like space junk and explains them in great depth then the author goes on to explain what kind ofaccidents that sapce junk causes then it explains that small even microscopic bits of junk can cause a catastrophe
23034,9,1,the author orders his articles in order of events he starts with space junk then goes to how big or small the space junk is then finally he finishes his article with how fast the space junk is going
23035,9,1,the author organizes the article by first giving the reader some information about space junk and how it has become a problem as the story progresses it lists more information for us to know about space junk and how it dan be a major problem for spacecraft including telescopesk and satellites that have been sent beyond earth's atmosphere
23036,9,1,the author put titles about his her starting paragraph to sort out the sections
23037,9,2,the author organizes the article by putting specific ideas together the author opens the article with an intense introduction but then settles down into a serious tone the author procedes with one idea at a time describing was space debris is the author ends the article with a reality reminder that space agencies need to work together and solve this problem
23038,9,2,at first the author draws you in with the cliche superman knock off line but then gets more serious through out the entire article he does an introduction a brief history of space exploration and what space junk is tells how dead or disabled satellites can crash into each other and then ends with hope saying coporations are trying to come up with a viable solution to space pollution
23039,9,2,he starts off by telling about clusterd space is then he goes on to talk about how this can be a threat to earth for instance when two dead satellites collide it doesn't just make two things of debris in space it makes many microdebris that can hit the earth plane or even a spacecraft
23040,9,2,the author organizes the article by breaking it down into sections and talking about different things in those sections like what is space junk and crash course
23041,9,0,good her or she didi it good
23042,9,2,the author organizes the article by first starting with an introduction that catches the readers' eye the introduction also contains the thesis statement 'orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satalite missions ' next the author describes what space junk is and how it was created after that in the section titled 'crash course' the risks of colliding satellites are hilighted finally in the last section the author talks about possible solutions and the persisting problem of space junk
23043,9,2,the article is organized by first telling about space exploration and then it moves on to telling about space crashes that have actually happened after that it goes on to talk about how serious the debris is
23044,9,2,the author has organized this article first by splitting the article into four sections the first section explains the main purpose of the aticle the second section explains how all of this space 'junk' has gotten there the third section explains how all of this debris has gotten into space the final section explains the dangers of the space debris and how the space agencies are trying to solve the probelm and prevent damage from space debris
23045,9,1,first they used a catchy begining to start then they went into a little history and info on the topic in the 'what is space junk' section from there they told of some of the bad that has happend like to satellites crashinginto one another then that opened up the topic of all the fragments that came from those two sattilites flying around in space
23046,9,1,they did a great job oganising this article first they get your attintion with grab you telescope look up in the sky it's a comet its a meteor then they get right in to the article about the what is space junk
23047,9,1,the author starts with an exciting introduction to lure the reader in next the author starts explaining the problems and why we should be concerned then the author persuades us to feel motivated
23048,9,0,the author puts the selection in a story format to make it seem much more interesting and to make the story have alittle more detail when he did that he could grab the readers attention
23049,9,0,the author organizes his article by putting useful information about whats going on in space or what has already happened the author grabs your attention by giving what was said in his hers class room then they go on to tell you important information for example of an important thing the author said is 'in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite' these things they've mentioned are important already
23050,9,1,he puts it into different sections that talk about different things and talks about facts in each section
23051,9,2,he starts out by telling the concern of space junk then moving on to what space junk is and what it's about the author explains the dangers of space junk using examples and things that have actually happened to make the reader believe it i understand the need to be concerned about this space junk because it could cause a lot of problems with the earth astronauts and space crafts
23052,9,1,the passage is sorted into four different sections each of the sections emphasize different but equally important topics its begins with an attention grabber and the the body is sorted into three paragraphs each one being supported with a lot of evidence they conclude the paper strongly emphasizing the importance of 'space junk '
23053,9,2,he first starts out with the introduction to be interesting to get your attention then he slows down by talking about how dangerous this 'space junk' can be then he talks in order of stuff that goes on in outer space he keeps it simple but also interesting for the readers he explains what goes on that we don't know and that we don't think goes on
23054,9,1,the narrator organizes ot by breaking the story off in chapters or seccsions
23055,9,1,the author organizes the topics by subheads the subheads break what seems to be long amounts of text into smaller more manageable and appealing reading in smaller sections fools the reader into thinking they are not reading as much as they think readers' eyes are drawn to the bold text above each topic this form of organization is a useful tool for organizing large amounts of information

23057,9,2,the author organizes in a good way by using sections the sections help us understand more about the space junk in space one section tells about the space junk and what it exactly is another tells us about some satellites craching into others and making more space junk each section tells us more and more about this arising problem in space
23058,9,1,starts out about outter space then gets into the junk up there and the technology
23059,9,1,the author sporates it in to many parts and that makes it very organized it being in the parts that it is makes it easy to find stuff if a certain part is asked about not having to read the hole article is nice if you can just read the headings and know where stuff is what's the point of wasting a lot of time reading the whole thing when you just neeed to read the middle section
23060,9,2,the author begins the article by relating to the reader in a humorous way once the reader has been hooked in the author begins to describe how big of a problem space junk really is after describing what space junk is the author talks about the dangers of the space junk and how big of a problem its becoming then we learn about how even the smallest of space debris can cause danger the auhor talks about how space travel is actually the cause and we need to put forth an effort to clean space pollution rather than adding to an already dangerous problem
23061,9,2,the space junk title is starting of by saying there is actually space junk in the next paragraph they are saying how the space junk even gets there in the last one they are saying how the space junk can harm space shuttles and all different kinds of things
23062,9,1,the author of the article begins by introducing a complex problem in a simple way he or she then provides the reader with background information to put the article into perspective from there the author goes on to thoroughly explains the problem finally the author clarifies the possible effects of the problem and explains its future course

23064,9,2,the author organizes the article by suptitles going from the most improtnant to the least they start off with explaining what the rest of the article was going to be talking about they explained what space junk was and how it was harmful then moved on to how they detect the space junk and how little bits of it is a serious problem
23065,9,2,he splits the article up into five sections introduction what is space junk crash course little bits but a big deal and a conclusion in his introduction he starts off with some surprising statements such as in lines 1and 2 in sections within the body he turns his tone into a more serious one he does this to emphasize the seriousness of space junk then in the conclusion he wraps it up by saying he is sure this problem will continue especially with an increace in commercial space travel
23066,9,1,by telling you what the space junk is and then explaining the great things about it and the bad things that can happen as well
23067,9,0,talks about how space satellites are leaving space trash
23068,9,1,the author organizes the article by first giving a catchy introduction that grabs the attention of the reader then the author defines the problem he is addressing he gives examples and possible causes of the problems then the author gives dangers of the issue the author puts an emphasis on the obstacles of space exploration finally the author re emphasizes the problem and restates the importance of safe space travel he explains what agencies like nasa and the european space agency are doing to prevent damage
23069,9,0,the author used a fun and interesting introduction to the article to grab the reader's attention after that it turns into a serious matter when the author defines the issue and gives an example of how the issue is created next the author gives great detail as to why it is such a serious matter and why people should be concerned about why it is occuring
23070,9,2,the author starts by getting the reader 'excited' then they get let down because the 'comet' isn't a comet it's a tool bag the line 'it's a tool bag ' directs that it starts talking about how several civilizations began to send satellites and spacecraft into space and how they eventually 'die' so the author explains what happens and what can happen to different things that happen to be left in the 'final frontier'
23071,9,0,i think that the article is not very organized
23072,9,1,he addes head lines to catagorize the info he clumps all the importat face of each paragraph and just addes informaation from each paragraph
23073,9,2,in the introduction the author gives a scenario to attract the reader's attention where he she then explains the scenario and it's significance in the article thus giving a topic sentence where in the following few paragraphs explains the origination and history of 'space junk' where the narrator then states the harmful effects of space junk and then explains why space junk is so harmful and finally the conclusion states some ways that nasa and other space agencies are trying to solve this problem
23074,9,2,first he starts out by getting the readers attention by personal experiance after the readers attention is caught he explains the reasoning for his introduction he then provides information on what space junk is so the reader has a clear idea in their head after he explains what happens in space with all the different satelites and how dangerous they can be then the last paragraph is there to show how important it is to know about all the space junk in space
23075,9,0,the author organizes the article by putting the most important information in first then all the background of the many different things that are placed in space it also shows the dangers of the outter space as well and the many different things to look out for
23076,9,1,the author organizes the article into sections that tie into one another and are clear each section ties into the subject the next section will be discussing the author also usesd comparisons and other facts to retainthe readers interest the author proves that the issue at hand is important by leading the reader clearly throught the article to the conclution the author wants
23077,9,2,this author organizes this article by first giving an introduction that popped and grabbed the reader's attention then goes into more serious matter dating back to when satelites were first built after the author explains that the satelites can crash and once they do that and 'die' they are automatically assumed as space junk then the author explains that even though the satelites and their peices can be little once more and more start 'dying' then outer space can become clutered quickly
23078,9,0,the author organizes the article by grabbing the reader's attention with each heading
23079,9,0,the still of writing and how he grabs our attention with the first sentencs andalso how the auther uses realiist information for the article
23080,9,1,the author organizing this article in sections the author starts with an attention grabber the the author goes into more detail about space and satellites
23081,9,2,the auther breaks up the article into subtopics such as 'what is space junk ' and 'crash course'
23082,9,0,by stating the main idea and having supporting details
23083,9,2,the author organizes the article but using sub titles and paragraphs he doesn't lump together different ideas he keeps ideas of the same nature within one se ction related subtitle he started with what is space junk whick explains what he's talking about crash course follows talking about how even minor 'space junk' can be a huge threat finally in little bits but a big deal he further explains how even the smallest fragment of 'space junk' can cause massave damage to a space craft and what steps scientists are doing to try to fix the problem
23084,9,0,the author puts facts with real information so the passage isnt so boring
23085,9,0,he she organizes it in a way that grabs the readers attention and then explains what the subject is after he she provide examples from the past then the author explains why it's important to know what he is telling you
23086,9,1,the author uses sub catiagories to explain the differant elements of space junk
23087,9,0,the author organizes the paragraph by going into detail about what is going on and what is happening he she is telling us what caused it to happen and how it happened but also shows us what we can do to change what happened
23088,9,0,there are a lot of junk in space
23089,9,2,the author organizes this article in a way that grabs your attention at the beginning then tells a little about the background information thirdly the author transitions into talking about dead satellites running the risk of colliding with each other finally the author concludes with saying that all of this trash in space is a big deal and we need to do something about it
23090,9,0,he's telling you to go outside and look at every thing floting around into space
23091,9,1,the author starts by hooking a reader the nmoves to historic facts about the issue after that they talk about the dangers of space junk and finally they mention that size does not matter it is still harmful
23092,9,1,by putting the article in 3 paragraphs
23093,9,1,they start with the launching of the junk and how it got in space in the first place then they tell us of the risks we face with the floating junk in space and how truly dangerous it is even though it is easily forgotten then to sum up the reason we should worry about little pieces of junk in space they tell of the speed and power packed into something the size of a very small rock and it's ability to strip paint
23094,9,1,the author has presented different sections in his article and given them funny names so that you will be currious and read what he has to say about space
23095,9,1,he tells us about junk in space by peices first he tells us what we call space junk then he tells us what the junk does after it crashes intop something then he tells us what this does to the enviroment and the atmosphere
23096,9,2,the author organizes the article in different sections to make it more interesting to the reader the author puts an eye catching opener to get the readers attention at the beginning and then goes on to explain the purpose of the article they include interesting information and make it fun to read

23098,9,1,he did it by parts he will talk about one part then the other
23099,9,0,the author orgainizes the story by telling the readers about space junck and how it can be kind of dangerous
23100,9,1,by starting off by telling about space junk then telling what it is then telling how it is creaqted in space by colliding satalites then telling you that all sizes of space debry are big deal
23101,9,1,the flow of the article is wonderful first it tackles the question of what space junk is and how it is caused then the author talks about a couple of examples that have caused space junk the last thing the author talks about is the debris that is caused by space junk colliding
23102,9,1,the author of 'orbiting junk' grabs your attention but shouting out statements it makes you wonder what the author is talking about putting the article in to segment is a sure why to have your reader know what you're talking about the author puts his article into four different segments doing that really helps keep your article organized
23103,9,0,i think they should just pick up any trash that is on the ground and tell them that they should make sure the outerspace is clean and no trash on the ground at all they have this everywhere counting on the united states and all the other contries that are around here in indiana they also go back to the earth so many hundreds its not even funny

23105,9,2,the author organizes his article by starting with an introduction which he uses to pull the reader in then he expands and reveals more information on his topic with an informative paragraph titled 'what is space junk ' he follows this by presenting a potential problem that arises with this topic appropriately named 'crash course' he concludes his articles by stating that precautions are being made to help with the dangerous dilemma while a complete solution is still underway
23106,9,0,he organizes this article by putting things in order of which they happened and then the author tells about the science of a telescope and what effect it has on the story itself he talks about global wirelees stuff and how the things he does works for him and how he loves what he does when talking about the aritcle the guy talks about how people rsearch stuff and read about stuff and get the wrong idea about how science is prtraid it think it has a lot to do with the guys opinon about how people look at the science portion of this article for the guy who was writing this article he has a huge disatvantage when it comes to explaining things in this aritcle when people don't understand the things your talking about it makes everything that much harder to talk about if you have peoples attention make sure they know what your talking about or atleast know the subject of the things your talking about
23107,9,2,he seperates it into different sectoins such as what is spacr junk and crash course
23108,9,1,the author talks about what is going to be in the article then puts the topics into paragraphs they explain past history about satellites and the variety of spacecrafts then they go into details about how its hard to be in space and all the objects flying at you after giving all the information they tell about how people don't care about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash
23109,9,1,it is organized by the revelance of the junk in space it first gives us knowledge about it then explains how it has damaged satelites
23110,9,1,the author uses headings to organize the story splitting it up into sections about different topics makes it eaiser for the reader to read
23111,9,1,the author organizes the article by putting the different problems into different sections of the article the author provides information that has happened with space junk and the problems that they have had with it the author also describes how it can later effect us horribly
23112,9,2,the author uses titles that break the article down into smaller categories to organize the text the titles gives the reader a little information about what the next section will mainly be about like 'crash course' the reader would get the hint that that paragraph would mainly be about things colliding the author also splits the text up into paragraphs that have the same idea it helps organize the ideas and keeps the same subject in an area
23113,9,1,the aurthor starts with an introduction to get you interested then moves into backround information after all of that he gives examples and then ends with how serious the problem is and the dangours of it
23114,9,2,the author begins the article by grabbing the reader's attention this is done by using statements with exclamation points and giving a little information then the author goes on to explain exactly what space junk is in this section the reader also learns some background information such as 'over the past 52 years a variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and satellites have been sent beyond earth's atmosphere ' the passage is concluded by explaining how important the topic of space junk is
23115,9,2,the author starts out with a good exciting introduction he catches your attention then gets serious first he just expalins to you what space junk is and how it gets there then he starts talking about the collisions as he goes on he talks about what happens with a collision if its bad or not then he talks about how stuff like this is a big deal even if it is just a small thing floating around it could cause alot of harm
23116,9,2,the author organizes the article by having a introduction as being a attention getter the the author broke the article down into sections for example in the heading 'crash course' it talks about the history of satellites that have collided in the past
23117,9,2,the author organizes the article by splitting it up and putting certain statistics in certain paragraphs so it keeps the reader entertained wanting to know more the author starts out the introduction with statements that catch the readers attention then they talk about everything that has been made recently for observing space then they talk about all of the collisions that have happened up in space and then they end the article stating how little things can have a huge impact on earth
23118,9,1,the author organizes his her ideas in a very effective manner the author starts out with a couple of shocking statements to get the reader interested and then the author starts explaining what they are talking about the author then spaces the article out into three sub sections this helps the reader know what the section is going to talk about it also clears up confusion in the reading
23119,9,2,first the author grabs the readers attention by making an awkward yet interesting opening statement which is 'it's a tool bag ' the next passage after that becomes a little more serious to make the reader understand how harmful space junk can be then in the next section the author gives the reader background information on space junk that is important to people can understand what space junk is and how space equipment becomes space junk that section connects well the crash couse section which tells the reader some specific information about crashes in space the final section explains in an elaborate way how harmful space junk can be and what cause it can have in the future so overall the author goes from grabbing the readers attention to giving background information for understanding to specific details and events and then finally the effects and future effects space junk can have
23120,9,2,the article is organized by the author into sections each section is seperate different subjects for example the section titled 'crash course' is explaining that when things break apart the debri stays in space and it can cause damage to other things simpily by just hitting it
23121,9,1,the author organizes the article in such a way that if a reader knows nothing about space junk before reading this they won't be lost while reading the author first draws you in with their introduction and then explains a brief history of space exploration next the author tells you how the space junk is created and then explains why it is such a big deal
23122,9,2,the author organize's the article with different titles to represent what they are talking about what is space junk crash course ect
23123,9,1,the author organizes this article into different sections including 'what is space junk' and 'little bits but a big deal ' another way the author organizes this article is into different paragraphs
23124,9,1,this article is describing about the space junk for exaple it describes what is that cause how it is danger to human this article describes history which is over the past 52 years then this article also including scientist's opinions or ideas
23125,9,0,he puts all of his information that he wants people to know all in different paragraphs and writes it all so it tells all that you need to know
23126,9,0,he oranizes the article this way to prove a point on how space junk has developed over the years
23127,9,0,the author organizes it by putting the facts in it and leaving to face out of it
23128,9,1,the author tells you what the topic is about and information on the topic then they tell you how it is effecting space or earth finally it tells you that you should take more care about space junk
23129,9,1,he starts the article out with an introduction he then breaks the article up into different sections he touches different topics in each one relating to the one big topic orbiting junk
23130,9,1,puts them into seperate sections
23131,9,2,first the author starts out with what the article is going to be about just like any other story should start out as in the fourth and fifth paragraph he is telling information about what has been sent to earths atmosphere in the 'crash course' section obviously he had put information on how the debris got in the way and satallites crashed into eachother and in the very last section called 'little bits but a big deal' the author talks about how debris is a serious problem to earth and space
23132,9,1,the author starts off with something to catch the reader's attention then goes on in a more serious manner and starts talking about space clutter and why it is important in the beginning the author say's 'grab your telescope ' then in the next paragraph the auothor say's 'such an observation isn't as strange as it seems '
23133,9,1,the author organizes the article by having a shocking first paragraph to bring the readers attention on the article then explains the facts about the topic much like an informational psa would with perhaps morgan freeman as the narrator it starts out interesting doesn't stop being interesting and keeps the viewer reader wanting to know about the topic
23134,9,1,the author organizes the article almost like a section from a book they use 'chapters' and headings to move on to their next topic they do this instead of creating topic sentences like a persausive essay first is the introduction then they give background and history so that the readers know some of what they are talking about next they give the reader the problem and what the consequences are lastly they give a solution to show the reader what can be done abou the problems
23135,9,1,first he starts out with a compelling introduction that is filled with both shocking and humerous statements to draw in the reader next he describes the history of his topic and how it came to be after that he gives statistics on the issue as well as stories pertaining to the theme finally in the last few paragraphs he explains how the modern world is attempting to handle this problem and how it may effect the future if things are not done to prevent it
23136,9,1,the author opens up the article with a question about what he is wanting the reader to undertstand he then talks about the satellites the orbit around our solar system now and how they are colidding and causing more debris he then gets into how the debris keep getting worse the space agencies hope the communications and the nations involved can work together to come up with a solution to space pollution
23137,9,0,the author organizes the article by first explaining what space junk is then explaining how it got there and then
23138,9,1,the author organizes this story by letting one fact or topic lead to the next topic
23139,9,1,they talk about nasa and how there is space garbage up in space there's satellitites that dont even work anymore so they just stay up there in space and everything else that goes into space and then it just stays there
23140,9,1,the author organize the article by putting the big main ideals like in bold letters to tell about each one at a time
23141,9,1,the author organizes the article by talking about space exploratins and the effects of them he talks about how space trash effects space and the world the author was using cause and effect
23142,9,1,by making new topics clear he had a title for every new paragraph and he makes spaces to show that the information is changing
23143,9,0,he starts out by grabbing their attention with almost telling a joke but its actual a serious probelm he changes his attidude as soon as the article starts by throwing out facts and history he organizes this by explain a big problem in an almost simple way
23144,9,0,any objects released into space become free orbiting satellites which means that astronauts must take great care when they leave their spacecrafts to make repairs or do experiments
23145,9,1,the author organized the article by putting the information into paragraphs and putting the information into the best fitted paragraph under 'what is space junk' they only talk about space junk
23146,9,2,the author organizes the article from the basics of space first knowing about space junk and how it effects research in space second is what could happen when there is a crash in space and how dangerous it is when dead satellites could risk colliding third how it is a big deal on what is in space and if it falls to the ground in conclusion the author is just making it easier to understand
23147,9,0,he organizes it by the different categories of space
23148,9,1,the story talk about how it is space junk and he she gices you a lot of information like dates on what and when things has happened in space and spacecraft
23149,9,1,the author organizes the article into three different parts the first part deals with the general answer of what space junk is the author goes from when space junk started which would be the launching of the first satellite then the author brings the article back to present to define sapce junk and how much of it there is then the author gives anecdotes on the dangers of space junk the author specifically refers to two satellites crashing next the author emphasizes the speed of space junk by giving illustrations the author compares space junk to sand lastly the author describes how the problem is trying to be fixed the author ends with a possible solution
23150,9,0,the author organizes the article by putting the most important things first and then putting other less important things last that is a good way of capturing the reader's attention and getting the most important imformation in without making it boring
23151,9,2,the author organizes the article by having the background information of 'space junk' and go into further detail then it goes into how 'space junk' gets into space and where it comes from with details and facts finally it goes into how dangerous these tiny pieces can be from collisions and 'space junk' also it states how they are going to have solutions to this problem and the affect it will have on the world
23152,9,0,the author makes it seem interesting at first then begins describing it so that the reader will take it seriously
23153,9,1,he organizes by starting with what is a space junk then he went on to crash cource and then little bits but a big deal
23154,9,0,such an observation isn't as strange as it seems orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions
23155,9,2,the author organized the article in way to guide the reader along with the information there is a lot of important information so the author organizes it so that the audience can completely understand it the author starts with background information of what space junk actually is and what happens to the junk the reader knows what will be in the next section because of the title 'what is space junk ' then the author tells how the space junk actually gets where it is the space junk is created from satellites colliding into each other and creating debris finally the author wraps up the article explaining why space junk possesses a harm to spacecrafts and other objects in space the space junk can 'create disastrous holes in an object moving through space ' the author builds information from the last section by putting more details into the next section to describe the effects of space junk more
23156,9,0,the author arganized the righting using information he knows and gathered about the junk in space then he goes into detail about how the junk even got in space and what the junk was after that they talk about the danger that the junk can produce and the will to get rid of it
23157,9,2,the author organizes the artice by putting the information into three different sections each section gives information about what happens the 'what is space junk ' section explains how space capsules satellites and teloscopes explore space this section also explains how sometimes they can collide and go into uncontrolled orbit aroung the earth the 'crash course' section explains how the dead satellites orbit around the earth and great speed and then crash into each other causing pieces from them to break off and sometimes go into earth the 'little bits but a big deal' section explains how something no smaller than the size of a baseball can not be indentified on a radar which makes it harder to a spacecraft to avoid those objects
23158,9,1,the author organizes the article by putting it in a magazine type of form he puts sub titles in the article

23160,9,0,the author organizes this article into questions followed by a few paragraphs answering that question for example the section labeled 'what is space junk ' is followed by two paragraphs answering that question
23161,9,1,the author tells about diferent things in different categories
23162,9,0,i thinkt he author organizes the article very well he has ton of details good and bad ones he actually says the truth and he dont sugar coat it it must have taken him a long time to figure out all of the fast about space
23163,9,1,he starts the article by telling us what space junk is and what the cause is he then tells us of the darngers and consaquences of the space junk
23164,9,1,he starts out with a gripping introducion for the first paragraph then he uses facts for most of the body of the summary then he states dangerous concerns to bring the reader interested again than he closes the final paragraph with hopes of achivments
23165,9,1,the author organizes this article by seperating the information into different categories starting with an introduction to get readers to comprehend what is being said
23166,9,1,the author organizes his articles by dividing them into the information he is emphasizing why each is important to know and gives a despriction for example 'what is space junk ' he doesn't want you to only put that one sentence in and explain it he wants to give details about it
23167,9,1,the author organizes the article by telling us that 'space junk' is a problem because the author is telling us how the problem is becoming more serious the reason why is that he is saying that in the future we are going to be putting more into the 'space junk' and it is going to become a bigger problem
23168,9,1,the author of the article 'orbiting junk' organize's his points by explaining a brief history then giving facts from the story and ending with what is being attempted to be done to remove the junk from space
23169,9,1,he organizes this article by starting from the basic thing the satellites he tells us how they can crash and what happens with the debris he ends it by telling us that we need to be more careful about our satellites and spacecraft
23170,9,2,the author organizes this article in to sections there is an introductory paragraph to get the reader's attention a section to explain the history of it all 'what is space junk ' a section to talk about space collisions 'crash course ' and a section to talk about how dangerous it can actually be even though space exploration is very important 'little bits but a big deal ' the author made a good decision by choosing to organize this article this way it really gets the point across
23171,9,1,in the article he tells us how leaving junk in space is a threat to us by leaving so much of it in space it makes it difficult to go to the moon for example for we leave too much clutter in space it can also be a threat to us from how fast it is going around the earth how it can damage spacecraft satalites or other stuff that goes into space by telling us this information scientist can someday find a way to get rid of spacejunk so that we can see what space is like to us the author organized it by telling us the history threat and a way to go into space without junk in the way
23172,9,2,the author opens the article with a introduction to get the readers attention and then he gives a third paragraph to keep the readers attention and tell them what's coming after this the author seperates the rest of the article into three sections 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' these sections help seperate the articles so the author doesn't have to try to transition from one thought to the next but instead give us information and connect them again at the end of the article in the conclusion
23173,9,2,the author organizes the article into different sections that fall under the appropriate headings things like satellite collisions are under crash course while the actual definition of space junk which is a different topic is under a different heading to make the article easier to read and understand
23174,9,1,he organized it very well i think he made his introduction very interesting and it really drew in the readers and the rest of the article was great too

23177,9,1,the author organizes this article with an opening statement that will grab the readers attention an give the authors opion after the opening paragrapgh the second paragrapgh gives deep detail about the history of space junk
23178,9,1,the author organizes the artivle by summing up all the important facts about space junk and the similarities and differences from all the different sections he goes into details from the the other sections as well and puts it all together in the last paragraph
23179,9,1,he organizes this article by having the introduction first then explaining what the space junk is so we know what he is talking about then the facts and last the effects it has on us
23180,9,0,he organizes it by asking rhetoric questions in the begining of the article he defines it and tells us what it is mainly about then he explains in more detail what else is in outer space such these as microdebris fields and other space junk
23181,9,1,the author uses a interesting or attention getting first paragraph to get the readers attention then adresses what the main topic is in paragraph four titled 'what is space junk ' he then lists problems and how it happens and what becomes of it space junk after collision he then gives reasons as to why it's a big deal 'so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash ' 'actually many people do ' he then agains warns of the danger space junk can cause
23182,9,0,the author organizez the article by having the introduction be about the orbiting junk in space and then explaneing what the junk in space really is
23183,9,1,the author breaks up the passage in sectrions to et the reader know what they are about to read and what is goinng to be in the next section
23184,9,1,the author begins by talking about the history of space and talks about space junk talks about how space junk can be very dangerous for us also talks about how little junk can be but that it can be a very big deal
23185,9,2,the author organizes the aritcle to explain everything in order the article starts off with the introduction then to the section titled 'what is space junk ' to explain what the introduction was about the next section is 'crash course' because the last part of the previous section talked about satellites loosing control and going into orbit so 'crash course' talks about what can happen when satellites go into orbit after 'crash course' the next section is titled 'little bits but a big deal' this is next because it talks about what can happen when two satellites crash into each other which was talked about in the last article the author organizes the article like this to make the reader understand without getting confused
23186,9,0,the author starts out exciting then goes into information on satellites
23187,9,2,the author starts off by getting your attention the explaining what space junk is then they talk about how satellites can collide with each other the author ends by explaining how space junk poses a big problem
23188,9,1,the author organizes the article by first giving you an introduction to the topic of space junk then they tell you about how satellites can crash into eachother and cause damage like the american satellite colliding with the russian one after that they tell you about how little particles can make a great impact once they reach a faster speed then they end with reminding you the importance of space junk and that it is increasing in space
23189,9,1,the author starts by using a catchy introduction and goes into some history on the subject after that he brings up an event about his subject then he trys to convence the reader to agree with his option

23197,9,2,the author organized the article with a persausive informative feel that also has a introduction body and conclusion the introduction is very attractive in paragraph one the author began by commanding the reader to do multiple unique things on top of that the author also asked a rhetoric question in paragraph two with a bit of humor mixed in the body of this article has a more serious tone by providing facts and history about satellites and how they become space junk in paragraph four sentance one the author explains how 'in 1957 the soviet union launched the the first artificial satellite ' the conclusion of this article is paragraph 11 where the author clearly restates his point of writing the article in sentance one and two of paragraph 11 the author proclaims 'yet the problem is certain to persist in fact the amount of space trash is actually increasing becaus e commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration '
23198,9,1,the auther organizes the article in sections of different statements and problems
23199,9,1,that objects in space can cause harmful reactions to our planet so we must reduce our activity in space why risk something that can hurt the entire planet over the past 52 years a variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and satellites have been sent beyond earth's atmosphere they explore the vast reaches of our solar system monitor atmospheric conditions and make global wireless possible has had also major out comes that possibly could harm our planet in the long run
23200,9,0,like a news paper
23201,9,0,the author organizes this article by collecting facts and concerns by the government the author also has facts from other countries the author takes these facts and hands them to us in an article as we just have read
23202,9,2,the author organizes the article very well he starts off with a great introduction that has the ability to catch the reader's attention he then tells us what space junk is as well as provides us with reasons why sending objects into space we send capsules telescopes and satellites into space because they do so much for us they monitor atmospheric conditions and make global wireless communcation possible in the next paragraph we read about crash courses having read the article before it we know why this can be a terrible occurence the following paragraph 'little bits but a big deal' gives us more evidence that space debris can be a very serious problem so at the end of reading the article we've been informed in a good order about 'orbiting junk'
23203,9,2,the author organizes this article by first using an interesting interduction to hook the audience then they broke the remaining paragraphs into catagories in order to make the article easier to follow and understand the catagories the author used were 'what is space junk ' 'crash cource' and 'little bits but a big deal'
23204,9,0,he satrd wit sapce and te satilies and how thay work
23205,9,0,the auther satys on track
23206,9,2,the author organizes it into three different sections the first section tells us about the space invasion and about general space junk the second section is about two satellites colliding wih one another causing microdebris the third section is about the people caring about microdebris and the increase in more of it because of other countries joining the race to space
23207,9,1,the author starts off with an introduction from the point of view then the author gives a little information about how there has been some crashes between a american and russian traveling at 20 000 miles hour also on how if the tools are dropped that they can be very harmous they even use sand being shot from a cement wall
23208,9,2,the author first talks about space junk in witch is the main idea about this passesage then the author talks about crash course then about little bits a big deal
23209,9,0,the author organizes the article in a way where it is very easy to understand what we are going to read about when the author puts 'little bits but a big deal' we know we are going to read about something that is little but it means something serious

23211,9,1,the author organizes the article in chronological order the author says something and then they go into detail and explain it better in the next paragraphs for example in the third paragraph it mentions space junk then in the fourth paragraph it explains in more detail about space junk
23212,9,0,the author makes it easier on himself by opening a question and in the next paragrahp explaining what it is
23213,9,1,the author uses history to tell how there is and hoe the space junk got out into outer space then he tells how big of a danger it can be out in space he goes on to say how one little screw and mess up the whole space ship
23214,9,1,the author organizes their article by seperating different paragraphs of information with bold heading there is an introduction and three body sections the last information section includes the conclusion
23215,9,0,they start out with a humor intro then they go more serious talikg about how it might become a danger to earth they add a little history in it also add what we can do to elimate the promblem they organize it so the reader would stay intertained and not stop reading it

23217,9,2,the author organized the article with an inroduction and a body they start out my just explaining what they are going to talk about they move on to what really is 'space junk' thhe author gives us information on the topic and little history behind it then they start to bring out facts and statistics next they talk about the damage space junk can do they give more facts and number that we cannot ignore finally they tell us that this is serious matter and we have to face it the author tells us that the space junk numbers has gone up and it is damaging our orbital system around earth they also conclude that the space junk is making space missions more dangerous
23218,9,1,the author organizes this article by telling you about outside of our planet about what is in the orbital pathways which is called space junk tells about satellites crashing into each other and he tells about the space debris that's there
23219,9,1,he or she tells us about orbiting junk then goes on telling us whats in space then gives us information
23220,9,2,the author beings the article with an attention graber to introduce what the rest of the article will include he then use the next sectoin 'what is space junk ' to define and descibe the problem at hand next in the section 'crash course' the author explains that 'dead satellites run the risk of collidin with each other ' which is becoming a major issue 'little bits but a big deal' is used to emphasis on the idea that this is indeed a serious problem that needs to be fixed he concludes in stating that 'space trash is actually increasing' and that we most 'work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution '
23221,9,0,the author organize it by explaining each thing that he talks about like the history of the satellite and who sent the first ones up into space
23222,9,0,he catches the readers attention
23223,9,2,the author organizes this article by presenting different topics about how space junk is created and how it can be harmful each section presents a different problem contributing to the build up of space junk the author starts out by grabbing the reader with some shocking statements and then explains the topic of the article the author then continues on to explain what space junk is and how it is building up in outerspace after the author shows how satellites collide causing them to break into smaller pieces which leads into the last section about how harmful the tiny pieces can really be

23225,9,2,the author organizes the article in a way that it starts out introducing and explaining what space junk is and gives facts and other things that talk about what happens and how space crafts and such become space junk then the article continues explaining the happenings and the consequences of these happenings by giving statistics and other facts in the section 'crash course' after establishing what space junk is and how it is hazardous the author tells how much of impact that all of this space junk can have and how it continues to increase today therefore the article is made in a way that it leads up to how dangerous space junk is and why we should be concerned
23226,9,1,the author uses a good inroductory statement with a good thesis the author uses some background history of space exploration the paragraphs that folllows desribe what happens to spacecraft and other objects that go up to space the author uses a good conclusion
23227,9,2,the author organizes this article into sections questions for each topic the author is letting us know which information about space junk should go where and where we can find it it is a very helpful way in letting us find information on a given idea he gives us a background of space junk and then gives us sipporting details of why this is a big deal
23228,9,1,the author organizes the article in sections such as 'what is space junk ' 'crash course ' and 'little bits but a big deal '
23229,9,0,the author organizes the article by telling you what could happen if you were in space and things like this happened you would need to no what to have with you at times and what do you when you are on a space mission
23230,9,0,she did a very good job the exciment and also just the mono tone was very effective for me i like this passage alot the whole thing about space junk was good
23231,9,0,the author uses somthing that would catch somone's attention
23232,9,2,the author organizes the article by using interesting facts to grab the reader's attention in the paragraph 'what is space junk' the author defines what is causing the problem in space in 'crash course' the author says how the debris is created finally in 'little bits but a big deal' the author talks about the dangers of the debris in space and how various space programs are dealign with it
23233,9,2,the author organizes the article by dividing the entire article into certain sections some of the sections included 'what is space junk' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal ' in 'what is space junk' it described what space junk actually is its says that some of the disabled objects become a piece of high tech junk and it cirlces the globe in uncontrolled orbit in the next section 'crash course' it talks about a time when two communications satellites crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth in the last section 'little bits but a big deal' it talks about how tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts it also states that the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commerical space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration
23234,9,1,he breaks it up to give a better understanding he gives a good introductions and then gives a topic and under the topic he gives examples and a experience he may of had with lots of details

23236,9,2,he starts out with a very attention getting thesis and the he starts at the beging to explain the space junk and what it is then he tells you what the junk came from and how it got there at the end he tells you jow it can harm you or the earth and how dangerous it can be
23237,9,2,the author organizes this article by splitting the topics up he doesnt just put everything together he makes subtitles when he is talking about space junk he labels that section 'what is space junk ' but he labels 'is' itallicized because he is trying to make a point
23238,9,2,the author organizes the story with easy to navigate subtitles this method makes it easy to find important information about a certain topic for example if you are curious about the crashing of two satelites you can look under 'crash course'
23239,9,1,talks about how soviet union lantched the first satellite and the united states folowed suit and this started the space junk how the rockets fall back to earth and how some of the satellites still orbit the earth and how some have crashed back into the earth
23240,9,2,the author organizes the article in a way to explain to you what it is that they are talking about and then tell you why it is so important and why you should be concerned the introduction is an attention grabber so you will want to read the article in the section subtitled what is space junk the author explains what a satellite is and how they function in the second section crash course the author tells you about the risks of the dead satellites the last section tells you why it is a big deal the author organizes it in a way to make it easily understandable to the reader
23241,9,0,the author categorizes it in such a way that you remain interested and he talks about some of the bigger events that have happened in space he also talks about some of the issues that could happen in the future
23242,9,0,i think he is trying to tell us that there is space junk up there and we need to cut back on it cause it can be dificault to manuver a spacecraft throught it when they are lanching off the platform
23243,9,2,this person organizes it by having head lines in bold letters this person also starts out by asking a question and then going into what is space junk then it slowly goes into crash courses and how bad it effects our atmosphere
23244,9,1,the author organizes the article by seperating all of the topics into four different parts this help to explain different parts of the satellite importances it seperated them from satellites in different countries to seperating them in how they can one day crsh in outter space
23245,9,2,the author organizes the article by identifying what exactly it is we are talking about then by saying where it comes from finally the author ends with how it does this in 'what is space junk' the author tells us what space junk is space junk is pieces of debris from various space crafts and such in 'crash course' the author states that these debris come from dead satellites that run into each other finally in 'little bits but a big deal' the auther explains how these debris can be very dangerous these debris when traveling at five miles per second can cause serious damage to elite spacecrafts
23246,9,0,he gose in order one what he knows instead of skiping around
23247,9,0,chronological order
23248,9,1,this article is organize mostly like an outline it has different sections and after each few parphgraphs it has a new title telling what the paprphraps will be about
23249,9,1,he organizes it by starting from when spacecrafts were first being launched and the problems they were causing then to the ones being launched today and the problems they're causing now
23250,9,2,the first three paragraphs get you hooked into the story and make you want to read more paragraphs four and five give you information about the history of space travel and how and why the space juck is even in space paragraphs six and seven tell you how dangerous space junk really is the last four paragraphs let the reader know who is worried about space junk and what people are doing to fix the problem of space junk
23251,9,2,the author begins the article with a catchy indtroduction then the author gets more serious and begins to describe space history and the occurence of 'space junk' in outer space the author states his her claim that 'space junk' is a danger and supports this claim with facts regarding the speed and amount of 'space junk' in space the author's claim is concluded by stating that several space agencies are working to take care of this problem
23252,9,2,the author organizes the article by starting with an attention getter than the author gives his thesis statment the author goes on to give background information about the space program than the aithor stresses the dangers of small free floating particles in space the author wraps up the article by giving future problems that could occur
23253,9,2,the author organizes the article really well in my opinion the author starts off with an interesting introduction that slowly brings you into the rest of the article after that they get into a sub topic clearloy explaining exactly what is space junk and how it has developed in our orbits they used many facts that really impact the readers knowledge about this space junk next they talk about how the debris free orbiting the eart can cause collisions with other debris they use facts and even an instance where the colliosions have appeared in the final topic they speak about the dangerous and the threats that the debris can cause this passage is very well made with facts comparisons and even an instance of adding more dangerous space junk by loosing a tool bag
23254,9,2,the author starts by telling a simple story about a tool bad falling from the sky then the author defines space junk and it's threat to earth the it gives some information about two satellites crashing last but not least the author tells us the big pictures such as how the debris can harm spacecrafts and imcreasing amount of space junk
23255,9,2,the author starts off by explaining the situation and what has been going on in space which would be the section titled 'what is space junk ' after he explains the situation he moves on to describe how this is a bad thing and how it is happening then he ends it by talking about how it can affect us
23256,9,2,i think the author did a fine job with organizing this article by getting the reader's attention in the introduction with dialouge i became interested about what this article would help me learn about after the introduction the author spent his or her time informing the reader about what 'space junk' really is next the author showed the reader how the pieces of debris collide with eachother finally the last paragraphs were to show the reader how important 'space junk' is and how much nasa and other space exploring organizations are concerned with it
23257,9,0,the author organizes the article by fact and opinion
23258,9,2,the author organizes the article by putting them into different sections on space exploration the author puts 'what is space junk ' first for explaining the variety of things we are putting in the atmosphere the puts 'crash course' this is letting us know that the space junk is now orbitting around the earth at intense speeds 'little bits but a big deal' this is explaing the danger in these objects orbitting the earth
23259,9,2,the author organizes the article well with the start of a simple introduction the author then starts with individual topics to explian the cause the author begins with explaining space junk then how it effects the crash course then lastly the author explains how little bits can become a big deal
23260,9,1,the author organizes the article with different topics realting to 'space junk ' the author uses seperation by organizing the article with different sub topics that explain in more detail the dangers in space junk
23261,9,2,the author organized the article in a unique way firts starting with an introduction that came with excitment then explaining what he was going to talk about 'space junk' then with what happens with all this junk and if it carshes after that how little bits can make a big deal later on finally ending with a conclusion
23262,9,2,in the first section the auther explains what space junk is and how it got into space in the second section the author tells about how free orbiting satellites can crash into each other causing small satellites to be formed in the last section of paragraphs the author talks about how big of a danger small free orbiting satellites can pose and how many countries are trying to find a soloution to the problem
23263,9,1,the author organizes this article in a way that first presents the problem then the author goes into further depth about the issue the author first explains where space debris comes from then explains why it is so dangerous the author begins with a fact 'in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite ' this makes the reader understand first where the space debris comes from then the author discusses the dangerous effects of space debris 'at extreme speeds little bits can pack a punch powerful enough to create disastrous holes in an object moving through space '
23264,9,0,i think the aurthor organizes the article by putting the actions first and i thaink thats what makes the aruthor have veiwers and grabes the atention also i think another way was the aurthor put interesting facts in the story that would also atract people to read the aurthor's story
23265,9,2,the author first draws the reader in with the introduction then they talk about various forms of space debris after that they discuss what happens when two satellites collide finally they state why 'space junk' is such a problem
23266,9,2,the author in organized this article well by starting out with a common retorical allusion explaining what space junk is giving an example and then explaining how it's a problem
23267,9,2,the author organizes the article into different sections each with a defined purpose the first section is an attention grabber to get the reader interested line 1 'grab you telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor ' the second section is background to give the reader a little knowledge about the topic line 4 'in 1957 the soviet union launched th efirst artificial satellite the united states followed suit and thus began the human race's great space invasion ' the third section is what's going on now with the topic line 6 'with no one at the controls dead satellites run th erisk o fcollding with each other that's exactly what happened in february 2009 ' the last section is why the reader should care about the topic line 8 'so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash '
23268,9,0,the auther wanted to write aboutthe danger of debris in space that culd destroy the satilites if not checked
23269,9,0,who organizes it over what things are important in space junk and the exploration of space junk
23270,9,1,the author organized the article by splitting sections of paragraphs up using different chapter titles this way the article can change topics somewhat freely without looking unprofessional it also helps the author in knowing what to talk about where
23271,9,1,this article is organized by facts some are about junk spacecrafts themselves and even space trash it is very well organized by the paragraphs
23272,9,2,the author organizes his thoughts very uniquely in this article for instance they start out with a shocking statement for a lure then they move on to a definition and such requires the history of the objects after such they follow suite with the dangers of microdebris out in space and just how lethal it can become upon the end of that they switch to how to counter act the problem
23273,9,1,he organizes it in different sections to seperate the different topics he does this so that the reader doesn't get confused and it makes it more appealing to the reader
23274,9,1,he puts the stuff into a way like a person writing a paper he puts the indtroduction then a couple of paragrahs explaining what it is then he gives a conclusion
23275,9,1,by seperating the subject changes with a headlining question
23276,9,1,he organizes in diffrent sections describing each section
23277,9,1,they first give a brief history of the world's space exploration in the same paragraph the author tells the reader about what space junk is and how it comes about the author then expands on different subjects under 'space junk' throughout the article
23278,9,2,the author organizes it by first explaining what space trash and debris actually is he does this with the heading what is space junk under this heading he talks about how space junk actually occurs as well as a little bit of the history of space travel then he uses the heading crash course to talk about the different crashes between free orbting satelites in the past then finally he uses the heading little bits but a big deal to try to make the readers understand that even those small tiny bits of trash can seriously harm the functioning satelites and other space craft
23279,9,2,the author starts the artical by grabbing the reads attention with a good hook line from the intro the author contunues onto define what space junk is to inform the reader what the rest of the paper is about after defining what the space junk is the author then gives an examples of how space junk is made after making sure the reader know what she is talking about the author goes into the subject of how dangorus these pieces of junk are to astronuts and space travelers in the same paragraph the author also states the the scientifical community is serching for a solution to clean up the debries
23280,9,1,the author at the beginning grabs your attention by saying shocking facts next the author jumps right into factual information such as space junk then the author discusses the harmful use of the present time lastly the author talks about the future harms to come to space by talking about countries launching satelites into space which will cause an extreme load of space junk
23281,9,1,the author organizes the article into sections with headings the headings give you an idea about what you will learn in the passage below the heading
23282,9,1,the author divides it up into a few sections which i think is a pretty good idea because it grabbed my attention
23283,9,0,it gives specific detail about the space and it tells you that scientist are hard pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk it's giving information about the satelite problems
23284,9,0,they organized the articles by telling what the problem was then go over if these things stay in space how they could harm us
23285,9,2,by how things happen and when they happen this is how he does it what is space junk crash courselittle bits but a big dealhe does it that way so you know what the passage is going to be about and what it is going to talk about he also does it so you know the title of the passage and so you don't have to try to figure out what it is about another reason he does it so he can orginaze the story into different sections
23286,9,0,at first the author grabs the readers attention then the author organizes the article by making each article more important than the last
23287,9,2,the author organizes the article first by giving the background information of the start of space exploration they continue on to define satellites and how they are used the second section describes how the satellites played a role in history then the author goes on in the last section to describe how the satellites are a problem now by explaining how they are involved in space pollution
23288,9,2,the author organizes it by putting it into four different sections each explaining a different part about space the first section just explains that there are things in space called 'space junk' the second section explains what space junk is and how it got there the third section explains that free orbiting things move quickly and there is a possibility that these things can crash into each other lastly the fourth section the author talks about how even such little things such as pieces of debri are a big deal to people scientists and the earth
23289,9,1,the author organizes the article by first talking about orbiting junk then what is space junk then crash course then little bits but a big deal it just talks about each one indavigally by its self
23290,9,1,the author explains what space junk is then explains how it is harmful and last explains how serious this is and that we should help
23291,9,0,he organizes it in the years
23292,9,1,the author catchs or attention by making a some what funny statement then the author tells us some history behind spae invasion in this section they talk about what happens to the debris that comes close to the earth in the next section they talk about crashes that have happened between satellites from different countries they tell us a little story about how an astronaut lost his tool belt in space they explain to us how even something that little can cause a big problem
23293,9,1,the author breaks it down in sections each section talks about diffrent parts of the topic
23294,9,2,the author begins with an introduction that grabs the reader's attention by making a shocking statement instead of seeing some meteor or comet the author sees a toolbag in space the author then explains what space junk is and how it got there to give us some backround information in the crash course topic the author states that not just outer space crashes create debris but random small objects too in little bits but a big deal the author elaborates on why we should be concerned one reason we should be concerned is the space debris can crash into our working sattelites and disable them the author ends with an outro paragragh stating that the problem is increasing but there are people looking for a cheap and easy way to solve the space debris problem
23295,9,0,the author organizes this article to get peoples attention to try and let them know that things are dangrous and we don't see it i feel all the author was trying to do is get his or her point across in a way that would let everyone understand
23296,9,1,first the author grabs the reader's attention so that they will keep reading the author then explains what space junk is so that the reader will know what the article is talking about the next thing that is talked about is examples of how space junk ended up flying through space like when the astronaut lost his grip on a tool box the last thing he tells the reader what problems the space junk is causing and how people like nasa are trying to solve the problems
23297,9,1,the author starts off the article with a simple introduction that will grab the reader's attention because of the funny reference the author slowly goes into the importance of the debris floating around in space the next paragraph of the article starts to inform the reader just what is space junk to clear up any other myth about it the examples of stories and even facts about what exactly is orbiting our earth keeps the article's main purpose flowing their idea was to lead into the true facts that the amount of debris orbiting with the earth is a great amount the last paragraph is meant to leave the reader thinking about what is actually going on in the space above us
23298,9,1,he put new headngs on it every time he would stairt a new secshion
23299,9,1,the author organizes the article into multiple sections which each have their own topic to cover the topic of space hazards is too general to cover in one section so many sections are needed to describe all aspects of the idea the writer is hoping to get across
23300,9,1,they organize by events that are in differnt sections and they use them in that order
23301,9,0,by seadily stating facts and then completely proving his her point at the end
23302,9,2,starts off grabbing your attention and then it gives you facts about 'space junk' then it defines space junk for you and gives you some examples and then gives you the dangers of having space junk
23303,9,2,the author is very organized in this article the author starts off the article by catching the readers interest and attention he she does this by using exclamation and question marks then by titleing the section 'what is space junk ' the author writes about what he she will be explaining next the author gives examples of what is happening in the world and space by explaining a crash that happened between one american and one russian communication satellite he or she starts off the section by saying 'in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite ' lastly the author explains how dangerous space trash and space pollution is he she also explains 'yet the problem is certain to persist '
23304,9,1,he stated out talking about the history of the satalites and some insteresting facts about them then giving information about an actural accurance in space with two satilites his ideas on how to stop space polution and the dangers and how to prevent it are need to help end the reading
23305,9,2,the author organizes the article in four basic tones the first tone is the introduction which is used to grab the readers attention when something interesting and fun with the help of explanation points the second tone is the explaination of the problem this is used to tell the reader the main reason of this article and to explain what 'space junk' is the third tone is a brief history lesson where the author gives real facts of satellites being destroyed by collisons the forth and final tone is the 'call to action' tone where the author brings you into the situation and convinces you to help
23306,9,1,he first starts with the general idea then he goes into more ststistics and history last he tells why space junk is a problem
23307,9,0,the author organize the article by telling what it is how did it start the author use date and times he also use how difficult it is out there in space
23308,9,1,the way the author organizes the article is quite interesting the author breaks this article into sections making it easyer to read and summerizing each section on the way
23309,9,2,the author organizes the article in sub headdings this way seperates information into an easy to understand way so it is easy to find certain pieces of information such as in the sub headding of 'crash course' it talks about our satellites colliding with russia
23310,9,1,the author organizes the article with several sub sections with a length of about one to two pargraphs this simplifies the material in the article making it easier to read also the sections themselves are about different subjects but share common points and topics within that tie together as the story continues and creates understanding of the main issue that being space junk and it's danger
23311,9,2,the author explains the problem in the introduction and first paragraph he then goes into why the problem is dangerous to astronauts and space shuttles in the final paragraphs he shows how some nations are limiting space junk while it is increasing because of the ammount of countries undertaking space exploration
23312,9,0,the author organizes the story through chronological order by starting with the year 1957 and ending by talking about present time by doing this he is explaining things that occurred in space during more than half a century
23313,9,1,the author organizes the article by telling the reader about space junk crash course and then little bits but big deal
23314,9,0,the author organizes this passage as a perrsuasive essay trying to attract readers and gaining their attention it is explaining the importance of the space objects and has sections to explain in detail of each thing
23315,9,1,the author give you so facts to think about of the topic then gives you history about the topic after that he or she gives you the dangours of the topic and how it effects us
23316,9,2,the author begins with an eye catching introduction he then sets a historical background and defines the term 'space junk ' to emphasize the seriousness of space junk he relates facts about real crashes that have occured finishing his article with information about the damage space junk can cause the author writes about the paths being taken in order to remedy the situation he finishes with a final warning that space trash is on the rise and companies must collaborate to fix the problem
23317,9,1,the author organizes the artical by explaining what space junk is and using statistics from research books internet the author also organizes the story by stating what will happen to space if we keep sending satalites to space and giving decriptions about outer space and nasa the author explaines about how the amount of trash is increasing because of commercial space travel and the military sending satellightes to space
23318,9,0,they start with questions and then work in the facts that they have found
23319,9,1,the author organizes the article by explaining the most important parts of space history he does this by talking about when the soviet union launched the first artificial satillite he also expains the danger of space exploration tiny fragments traveling at a high speed could cause major damage to the earth
23320,9,1,the author uses shocking statements to hook the reader so he can get interested in the article then he explains what space junk is while giving you some history about space exploration next he explains how and why satellites can crash into each other last he states that tiny space trash is dangerous and states that the amount of space trash is increasing
23321,9,2,the author organizes the article by makeing chapter like sections about different details in crash course the author is talking about the dangers of satellites colliding with each other in another he talks about what space junk is
23322,9,0,they start off by useing serioud fscts about the garbage in our atmosphere that is flying around in out of control msnner
23323,9,1,she starts out by gathering your attention about a coment so your like mhmmm sounds like a good article so then she goes on about space junk in 1952 founded by thesoviet union then it goes on about over time it closes
23324,9,2,the author organizes the article by sectioning it off into groups so we can understand the material the author starts off light hearted and keeps getting more serious 'what is space junk ' helps us understand the overall idea and explains the material in the article then the sections following that get more in depth and portray the seriousness of orbiting junk
23325,9,1,the author organizes th article by first telling you what they are talking about next they talk about what can happen to space junk then finally they talk about the problem they pose on the surface and the astronauts in space
23326,9,2,the author organizes this article by starting it off with a kind of comical start trying to appeal to the readers then he goes into the past giving the reader a sense of history next he still stays in the recent pass and gives us a thought about what happened and why that this happened then the author focuses in on the main topic and why all of this is such a big deal
23327,9,0,i dont know
23328,9,2,the author first talks about what is the earths autmosphere can handle and what we may see out there they then go on to what space junk actually is and how we have been doing it for the past fifty two years the crash course talks about how the little bits of debris can cause such a disaster in space and on earth they end the article by describing how the bits of fragments can cause the earth and satilites big problems
23329,9,1,the author starts out the article with intresting statements to grab the readers attention as the article progresses the author explains exactly what he is talking about and then gives the dangers and concerns about space junk and the effects it has on satellites
23330,9,1,the author organized this artical by starting off with information about when the soviet union and when thay launched their first satellite and then started talking about space junk and how satellite were crashing into each other
23331,9,0,the author oraganize the article by telling the importante part first and giving detials about the main part in the story
23332,9,1,they organize it by importance and in order of how it will affect us for example how they talk about what it is then stating how it happens and then what the 'space junk' actually is
23333,9,1,the way this statement is organized is very well because they start off by getting your attention next they start with some basic information that will help you understand what is coming up then after they hit the hard facts that you should know about 'space junk' like how even the smallest things in space can affect a big space ship with this happening also that we could have satellites crashing into each other and the tiny parts flying into earth so this article is very organized
23334,9,0,i dont really know but i know he is talking about space
23335,9,2,the author organizes the article by making sections of the article to have the reader become interested by the title and have them continue to read they will learn about the dangers of space junk and what can happen to it
23336,9,0,starts with the beginning of it all and then goes through it all tell what we know now it says in the beginning of what is space junk 'in 1957 ' and in the end it says 'in 2008'
23337,9,2,the author organizes the article by starting at the history of space explorations the author wants the reader to have a good background of how many different satellites have been put into space orbit the author then describes in great detail what exactly space junk is and what is made up of the author wants the reader to comprehend the amount of space junk in space the author then describes why there is space junk he tells about what is causing space junk and why the author describes that large things going extremely fast in orbit can cause tiny micro pieces being sent into space then the author tells the reaeder why they should care about space junk the author gives us different ways the space junk is harmful to space ships astronaunts and other satellites then he or she says what different space companys are doing about the space junk and how they are trying to prevent it
23338,9,1,the author organizes this article into diffrent sections throughout these sections he goes over diffrent topics about the 'space junk' he still stays on the same topic and convinces the reader that this is a serious matter while revealing diffrent sections that all tie together
23339,9,1,instead of putting all the topics into one big article the author breaks it down into sections this keeps the article more organized and makes it small articles put into a bigger article all the topics are related to one another
23340,9,0,he organizes the article in a way that describes the cause of one thing to the next and explains each section in detail
23341,9,0,he uses the more serious information as he goes so the more you read the more interesting and more serious it gets he also puts older facts before the more recent ones like he says in paragraph 4 'in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite ' then in the sixth patagrath he talks about something that happened in 2009
23342,9,1,the author organizes the article by first giving a brief introduction on space junk then they give a little bit of background information on space junk next the author gives examples of when space junk was actually harmful finally they explain how it's harmful and how it could potentially be a bigger problem
23343,9,2,the way the author organizes this article is that he uses a very eye cathing thesis or opening statements for example ' grab your telescope look up at the sky it's a comet it's a meteor ' then he puts a subtitle on the next subjects he brings up to keep it very organized example 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and then the last subtitle is 'little bits but a big deal' each subtitle leads into one another very nicely and does not get uyou confused
23344,9,1,the author first starts with a shocking quote then goes on to explain about this epedimic after the author explains that we should try to fix this
23345,9,2,the author organizes the article by starting with a introduction to grab the reader's attention then background information on space exploration and what 'space junk' really is the article then highlights different events where space junk has caused a problem or an accident has occured that created new debris in space the author then has a paragraph explaining how harmful space junk can be and how it can or cannot be detected the article finishes with a conclusion that outlines space pollution and the issues that can arise because of it
23346,9,2,the author starts with stating the serious yet shocking facts of the article then the article has seperate subtopics which state important details relating to the subtopic for example the subtopic 'crash course' tells the danger of satellites colliding together
23347,9,2,the author uses a hook to get the reader interested then they tell about what space junk actually is for people who don't know they also tell how that space junk is created finally in the section titled 'little bits but a big deal ' they emphasize that even though most space junk is only tiny peices it is a serious problem and can cause a lot of issues
23348,9,1,he organized them according to how serious the issue is they are all a big p roblem but some more then others like the satellites are all going to crash eventually is a scary thing to think about space debris is not always small there are some debris out there that would blow up a bigger satellite plus the astronauts have to go up there and fix things that get broke by the debris
23349,9,1,the author organizes this article by first grabbing the readers attention and then explaining the history of space travel and space junk through the sixth paragraph the author talks about why space junk is dangerous and how it effects us today the author also brings up the tool bag inncident most people wouldn't think it was a big deal if a tool bag was let loose in space but the author organized this article to explain why it is such a big deal after describing what space junk is and to warn everyone of the dangers of space junk
23350,9,0,by telling how space junk is when its in space and factors about it to
23351,9,2,the author brakes down the article into sections the sections he broke them into is what is space junk crash course little bits but a big deal
23352,9,2,the author begins the article with an attention getting introduction followed by historicle statistics finally including that satellites are in great risk of colliding with eachother and emphasizing the great danger of such small particles in space
23353,9,1,he has it very organized it goes in sections on how he wants it to be written
23354,9,1,they orginized it by throwing in history facts in the begging and then talking about the problems that occur in space with theses satilites and then they talk about how we can prevent all of these things that happen
23355,9,0,the author organizes the article by telling u what something is and tells u how it got there
23356,9,1,he organizes it from what is space junk to how it is harfuml on what it could do or effect something ot another
23357,9,2,the author organizes the article by different topics the first topic he talks about is what is space junk he talks about the different types of space junk in the section the second topic he has listed is crash course in this section he talks about what happened in february of 2009 when two communication satellites crashed into each other the third and final section in about little pieces but a big deal in the he talks about how little pieces of matter are a big deal in the atmosphere these little pieces flying around this fast can destroy a satellite
23358,9,2,the first paragraph is a very good attention getter it makes it clear to grab your attention then it follows into telling the readers a breif history passage about spacecraft it also later goes into telling the risks of satellites controlling eachother lastely it talks about how loosing space trash is serious matter
23359,9,1,the aurthor devided their artical into sections the first is to catch the reader attention the second to tell us what they are talking about and give us a breif history in the forth and fith section she made it clear how important it was to try and reduce the amount of space junk
23360,9,2,the author organizes this article using passages for different information what is space junks crash course and little bits but a big deal are all seperate passages that talk about different things
23361,9,2,the author starts his article with an attention grabber and briefly mentions space junk in the next article the author by giving a short history of space flight like the how the soviet union launched the first satellite next he describes how these space projects have caused problems and what they are sugesting to do
23362,9,0,the author organizes the article kind of like a comic book at the beginning the rest of the article is like a big story of information
23363,9,0,the author organizes the article in a simple and orderly fashion he she explains the problem and tells how it happened
23364,9,2,he starts with an attention grabing introduction he follows up with a section called 'what is space junk ' to get the reader involved and to provide factual information he then added the section 'crash course' to provide information on satellite crashes he ends with the section 'little bits but a big deal' to inform the reader of the dangers of space debris
23365,9,2,the author organizes this article by breaking it up into four parts the firt part or the introduction gives us a small anecdote on what possibly could happen the next three parts give us details on the three main points of this article 'what is space junk' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal'
23366,9,2,the author starts with a shocking hook which draws the reader in then in 'what is space junk' they give some basics as to how space junk has come to be in 'crash course' the author elaborates on space junk including a specific example in 'little bits but a big deal' the author goes into detail about what the effects of space junk can be and how they can cause a difficult situation in paragraph 11 they author concludes by stating that space junk is increasing and that a solution needs to be found
23367,9,1,the author organizes this article by putting the least important first and the most important topic last the author first started talking about space junk then moved on to satellites and how they can collide into other satellites the last thing the author talked about was how many people care about all of the trash that is in space
23368,9,2,the author starts off with an attention grabber allowing the audience to get hooked and read more then he talks about the facts of how many satellites and telescopes have been sent into space informing the audience what he is getting at then the author talks about how in space it's really not that safe he describes how satellites have a risk of colliding since there is no one controlling them finally he talks about how serious matters can be and ow they monitor the satellites and maintain catalogues of known subjects to wrap it all up he mentions that the space agencies hope that everyone works together to come up with a solution to space pollution
23369,9,2,the author starts off by grabbing your attention with the introdution then informing you what 'space junk' is he then talks about the damage that 'space junk' can do and finally tells what scientists are trying to do about it
23370,9,0,the author organized this article good the reason i say that is because he has told you how important it is that trash is not sent to outer space
23371,9,1,the author organizes the article by giving the history of people going to space and causing this space junk first then the author authoritizes the risk of what could happen if we keep making space junk after that the author talks about how we are trying to fix this problem and how we could fix it
23372,9,1,it lets you know what the paragraphs are going to be a bought it lets you know what space junk is first as it goes deeper into the article it gets more serious it finally conclues with a startling fact
23373,9,0,first he starts off with a personal comment then he defines what is actual space junk and how it got started then he states how we first started adding space junk and how its affecting people that are working in outter space
23374,9,1,the author starts by telling about the sky then they tell you about space junk what it is and how it got there the author tells you everything from the beggining to the end
23375,9,2,the author organizes the article with subtitles for exsample 'orbiting junk' 'what is space junk' 'crash course' 'little bits but a big deal' within these groups are the information in an orginised mannor
23376,9,2,the austhor first organizes it by telling us the history of how space junk actually got into space and then continues on to tell us its harmful affects and how to defend against it finally she challenges the reader's integrity by asking about the seriousness of this to other people
23377,9,2,the author organizes it by starting it off with a flashy introduction then proceeding to some history about space junk next he talks about collisions in space lastly he tells some specific things that have happen in space

23503,9,0,he or she does a good job at putting it togater beacuse it all made sense i thought it sounded good about how he or she talked about what is space junk crash course and littil bits but a big deal every thing that was in thoes aticals sounded good
23504,9,1,the author organizes the article in topic form he divides the article into different topics and all give specific information regarding space junk and the effects it has on space exploration
23505,9,0,hey whats to know about space junk ask your question what is space junk
23506,9,0,'the author organize the article' the author organize the article by telling us the different useage of space and junk when we send junk into space and when the junk collide's the junk will come back to earth's atomsphere and the junk could cause radiation or bacteria
23507,9,2,the author first begins on getting attention and becoming interested in this article the by giving the article different sections with different names graps more attention the first section is mainly talking about space junk and what exactly it is and when the dates where when this happened the second section however is about the crash course and how satellites are going to run the risk of colliding with each other which this has already happened in 2009 so by stated facts with dates it makes it more interesting
23508,9,1,the author organizes this article into sections with a few new titles for each section a couple paragraphs are in each section it is an easy to read article
23509,9,1,the author organizes this article in a way that the reader learns a little about the topic before getting into the details of the article the first paragraph briefly describes how this 'space junk' is created the second paragraph describes what the 'space junk' can do and why it poses a problem the thrid paragraph describes the damage the 'space junk' can do to space craft and then the precautions people are taking in order to protect the space craft and astronauts from the debris
23510,9,1,first the author gives you background information then he begins to explain a crash and shows how microdebris can cause severe damage in space
23511,9,2,the author organizes the article by telling what orbiting junk is and how we can stop it and just by having bullets notes like 'crash course ' and 'little bits but a big deal' and also making us worried for other peoples needs
23512,9,0,he starts off by getting our attention and then goes into the boaring stuff
23513,9,0,the author organize the article by not just putting his own story just by putting other articles together and giving the reader more understanding of the history
23514,9,2,the auther organized the thoughts with ledgible headings such as 'what is space junk '
23515,9,2,the author organizes the article with main points about space junk with the first main point he asks 'what is space junk ' to explain the main detail that the artical is about next he explains how space junk is made and last he makes a conclusion about why space junk is a big deal
23516,9,2,the author organizes this article to first get your attention then the author informs you of the history of satellites and space junk after that the author explains how dangerous space junk can be to anything within it's course
23517,9,1,the author organizes the article by using paragraphs and using sub headings
23518,9,2,the author organizes this article into different sections that explain about different things the sections are named as follows orbiting junk what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal orbiting junk refers to the items that are orbiting around the earth they are left over from satellite crashes or lost by astronauts what is space junk explains to the readers about what kind of items are left behind in space the section crash course refers to the event of a russian and american satellite 'running' into one another little bits but a big deal basically tells the audience about why and how having 'space junk' can harm the earth
23519,9,1,first he grabs your attention with some interesting details example being the tool bag in space then he explains what it is that the articles about also gives a little background on it and why its there then explains the danger is has to the future
23520,9,2,the author organizes the article with different sections all explaining different points for example the section titled 'what is space junk' simply explains the meaning and history along with statistics of space junk likewise the section titled 'crash course' is about differnt satellites crashing into each other and causing a rain of debris into orbit all the other sections follow a similar suit
23521,9,2,the author organizes the article in four sections first he starts with the introduction his introduction catches the reader's eye and provokes him to want to continue reading then he defines what he is going to talk about space junk after that he talks about the dangers of space junk through facts stories and examples about satellite crashes and space junk debris finally the author concludes his article in a way which leaves the reader wanting to do something to stop the production of space junk
23522,9,1,the author organizes the article by putting sub headings in so that you know what he is going to be talking about in the section
23523,9,1,space junk bad for us and space it coses so many problimes like with the skin on a space ship or the wings on a satulight so in sume respectds we need to clen up space just as much as wee need to clean up earth
23524,9,1,the author organizes his article by order of events when and where things happened and how imporant they were to further prove this the passage 'what is space junk ' it described dates of the soviet union launching their first satellite and how over the past 52 years how greatly things have changed
23525,9,2,the author organizes the article by giving background knowledge then conveying the problem and finally giving a call to action for a solution to the problem in the first piece of the article 'what is space junk ' the author gives a bit of information on what he she is about to be talking about the author gives the background information that the reader needs such as 'over the past 52 years a variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and satellites have been sent beyond earth's atmosphere ' then in this piece he she introduces the problem to readers revealing that the satellite that malfunctions and cannot be repared or the satellite that collided with something else 'becomes a piece of high tech junk circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit ' in the second part of the article 'crash course' the author conveys the problem which is the overall theme of the article he she even gives an example of a time when the problem occured when 'two communications satellites one american and one russian both traveling at more than 20 000 miles per hour crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth ' the author reveals that satellites can actually collide with each other and cause space debris which can be extremely harmful finally the author calls the reader to search for a solution to this problem he she conveys to the reader that 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise' and that scientists need to come up for a solution to this problem before it becomes too large to handle
23526,9,2,the author organizes the article starting with an introduction that catches the reader's attention the rhetorical questions are the talk about space junk will hold the reader's attention and ensure they stick around for more they then move into an intoduction to the space race and what space junk is this gives a good understanding for the reader as they continue down the article after that they start with statistics that shock the reader that really excites the reader to reading the last paragraph the last few paragraphs show the impact the space junk causes the efforts of nasa and the fact that space junk is increasing this gives a nice conclusion to the paragraph
23527,9,2,the way the article was organized by the authur is that first about orbiting junk which is objects in free orbit in space then it goes in to what is space junk which decribes what space junk really is next to crash course which decribes how the satellites crash noto one another then finally to little bits but a big deal which talks about even tho the parts in fre orbit are small but they cause a big problem if they hit anything
23528,9,1,the author organizes the article into different topics each topic has it's own little story about space
23529,9,0,the author organizes the article by explaining all the big problems in space to all the small problems in space
23530,9,0,i think this author organizes this article by using supportive details and information he got and comparing them together and providing the information he found out to other people
23531,9,2,the author starts off by explaining the history of space travel in the 'what is space junk ' section this way people who are unaware of the history will have a greater sense of how everything started then the author moves onto the next section which has examples of how space junk is actually created giving prime examples and actual events can make the problem more believable to the reader the last session is all about why someone should care that space is being polluted this article is organized by givimg you a how a when and a why
23532,9,2,the author organizes this article by using an introduction first and then three sections 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' the author captures the readers interist through the introduction by using a shocking statement and making readers think why is there a tool bag in the sky after this the author describes the history of space travel and the space race as well as describing what happens to technology that is broken and just floating around in space in the section 'what is space junk ' then in the section 'crash course' the author describes how satellites and debris collide and the effects of the collision after this point the author describes the horrible impacts of small microdebris on other space ships and satellites and what engineers and scientists are doing to counteract this in the section 'little bits but a big deal ' finally the author concludes that the problem is certain to persist and that the amout of space trash keeps increasing and then the author ends the article by saying that space agencies hope that corporations can come together to find a solution to the problem of space junk
23533,9,0,he orgganizes it by factes that he has of the space junk
23534,9,0,i think he put them in order by the first discovery and then in the order of more discovery's as time went along
23535,9,1,the author organizes his article in many ways one of these ways is by having a great introduction by having a great introduction the author is able to grab our attention in an instant and keep us reading another way is that the author describes to us what space junk is exactly they did this so we are able to get more background information on the article so we are able to understand it better
23536,9,2,the author organizes ideas by grouping and titling paragraphs the paragraph titled 'what is space junk ' consists of information about what 'space junk' actually is the author also lists details of conflicts with satellites and crashes that have occured in the past
23537,9,1,the author organizes the article in a very structured way they start out by a story then it goes into what space junk is it gradually goes into talking about satellites and the dangers of those then it starts to talk about how dangerous space junk really is and the fact that nothing is really being done about it in the last paragraph i like how it ends with this it starts talking about how little of a thing can be such a big problem we are starting to adjust to the space junk instead of the space junk adjusting to us we are changing for it instead of getting rid of the space junk i like how this article is structured it gives detail and stories it is informative as well as interesting there are always problems in the world but to know that even the smallest thing can hurt our world is good to know as well as knowing that nothing is truly be done about it
23538,9,1,the first section is used to get the readers attention there are not many facts and it makes the subject seem lighter than it really is the second section pulls out the facts and starts to get serious about the matter 'in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite ' the third section goes into detail about how some of the 'microdebris' came into our orbit and how easy it is to lose somthing in space then finaly the last section tells about the dangers and precautions we as a human race are taking to fix this problem it then concludes the essay
23539,9,2,the author organizes this article unconventionally first grabbing the reader's attention then explaining 'space junk' next explaining what can happen when 'space junk' collides and finally emphasizing the seriousness of 'space junk' and its possible effects
23540,9,1,the author starts by grabbing the readers attention with shocking statements then the author goes off and tells what is the space junk that is flying around after that the author tells how the space junk is in the way or in danger of other satellites but they are so little why such a big deal in this next paragraph he compares sand to the tiny bits if trash saying how big of a damage it can be
23541,9,2,he organizes it by topic such as what is space junk then he tells you about what space junk is the next is crash course an so on it is well organized in different catagories and topics

23544,9,1,first the author tells about the beginning of spce exploration then they talk about satellite accidents then the author talks about a toolbag getting left in space then it talks about the danger of microdebris in space
23545,9,2,the author organizes the article by talking about what space junk is and how it affects the earth's atmosphere then the author talks about how dangerous it is when objects in space collide next the author talks about why it is such a big deal and why we should be aware of space junk
23546,9,2,the author organizes the article by what the catergories are he has the introduction and then the first topic he wants to talk about which 'what is space junk ' then the author has 'crash course' another main topic and finally 'little bits but a big deal' and his conclusion he makes the topics seperated like this to look almost like a newspapper and to show each is important
23547,9,2,the author organizes the article with facts of 'space junk' that are in space due to space exploration the author then goes on to giving examples of what 'space junk' is and where it can come from the autor gives the example of a two satellites crashing into each other which created hundreds of pieces of debris the author then goes on about the difficulty for a spacecraft to be in space and stay clear of the debris left by other spacecrafts and satellites lastly the author summarizes the article and giving the reader the main idea of the article the main idea is that the 'space junk' in space is increasing and still a problem for space agencies

23567,9,2,in the introduction it catctes the readers atention by using shocking statements then it provides a history of space exploration next it talks about satellites and how they run the risk of colliding with each oter finally it explains that tiny bits of space trash is not a big deal
23568,9,2,well in the introduction he starts it off will a big bang and thats what probably gets everybody's attention then he breaks it down into a few paragraphs about space junk then satellites and then he talks about how the smallest things in space can cover 5 miles in a second so it is extremelly dangerous
23569,9,0,the article is organized by date it goes from past to present
23570,9,1,the author starts off by getting your attention with shocking statements that you didn't know about then explains what is space junk which is space capsules telescopes and satellites in the earth's atmosphere the crash course tells you how satellites space capsules and telescopes have collided in space and are very hazardous little bits but a big deal describes how people are getting mad from all of this happening because something could land on earth
23571,9,1,the author puts it in different sections there are 3 sections after the introduction and they all have supporting evidence each section title apropriately fits what information is in that section

23580,9,0,he has it organised to what subject he turns to
23581,9,1,the author organizes the article by dividing it into detailed sections that explain the different subtitles the whole article is about space junk but each individual title explains different information to create organization all of the authors thought that has to do with the crashing of space debris is under the title 'crash course ' all the information about the size of the debris is in the section 'little bits but a big deal ' these divisions help to make the article easier for the reader to understand
23582,9,1,the author organizes the article by seaperating it in different sections

23584,9,1,the author creates an introduction talks about how satellites become space junk and how it poses a problem with no one at the controls diad staellites run the risk of colliding with each other
23585,9,1,the author organizes this articel in a speach format though author first states what the problem is and why it is danguros then the author say why it is a big problem then the author gives the call to action being that space agencies hope to work with other corporations to find an easy solution
23586,9,2,the author starts off with background information starting off with facts about the first artificial satellite they then go on to tell of the dangers of space junk floating around in space start off paragraph six with a little story about free orbiting space junk they end the article with telling of the dangers of microdebris the small little things that float around can damage entire space stations
23587,9,0,idk this one either
23588,9,2,the author organizes this article by using headings based on the information in the paragraphs below them for example under the heading titled 'what is space junk' there are examples of what space junk is and how it gets there under the heading 'crash course' there are examples of how objects in space without control run the risk of colliding and causing a lot of damage to both objects and creating more space junk the author then closes the article with a good conclusion
23589,9,1,the author organizes the article by a timeline the author starts with how countries began the great space invasions and start exploring space then he talks about satellites crashing into each other and other debris flowing freely in space then he finally talks about how dangerous the debris can be
23590,9,1,the author organizes the article by iportance first the author starts out by explaining what exactly space junk is one of the more important factors of the article with out that the reader wouldn't really under stand the article next it goes on to give examples of space junk and reasons why its there then it lastly tells us about how small some of the particles are and why they are such a big deal
23591,9,1,the author organizes the article by seperating the information by order of importance and by organizing the article in a way that makes it easy to read and understand because the information is not all over the place this is shown by the author dividing his paragraphs into sections with different titles
23592,9,1,he starts out at sharing how space junk is harmful then he goes into talking about invastions and how they are created dead satellites then have a good chance of colliding with each other he shares how some people may not think that space trash is a problem but it really is he shares why some people make a big deal about it they make a big deal because it is one it is hurting the earth
23593,9,1,the author organizes the article very well first he tells about what it actually is then explains that it is a serious problem and is dangerous to astronauts and our earth then supports and backs up any information withh stastitics
23594,9,2,the author organizes the article by giving different sections are the article titles by doing this they are letting you know specific information about space junk for example in the section titled as 'crash course' the author shares information about the collison of two satellites going 20 000 miles per hour
23595,9,1,the author organizes this artilce by seperating it into three differnt parts the first part is the introduction intoducing wht the article will be about the second goes back to give us some backround information about whaat has been going on the third is to talk about how serious the matter is that they are dealing with and to help people understand what's going on now
23596,9,2,the author separates the article into four sections the first section is the introduction in it the author explains how 'space junk' is concerning government agencies all around the world the second section is titled 'what is space junk ' in this section the author gives background information about where space junk comes from the third section is titled 'crash course' in this section the author gives major events about space junk and what creates space junk the fourth section is titled 'little bits but a big deal' in this section the author gives information about how the tiniest bit of space junk can damage a space shuttle
23597,9,2,the author organizes the article by first grabbing the reader's attention with shocking statements and then explaining what space junk is the author then shows an example of two satellites crashing into each other and an example of microdebris the author also tells us that even the smallest debris can destroy a spacecraft and say that solutions are difficult
23598,9,2,the article contains topics 'what is space junk' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' to organizee the article
23599,9,0,from year to year that people went into space
23600,9,2,the author organizes the article according to topic for example in subsection what is space junk the author explains exactly what is space junk in the other two subsections they are once again organized by topic crash course talks about crashes of space junk and little bits but a big deal talks about micro debris
23601,9,1,the author does a good job of stating proof after his statements everything he says is backed up by proof he explains to the reader what space junk is the how it happens and even gives examples of space junk in the world today
23602,9,0,he starts off this artical from what he is talking about to why he is talking about it and tells whats all in space all the satalites and how in a couple of years that it will be dangerous to even go into space mainly because of all the satalites now that are out there
23603,9,1,the author organizes the article in a way that helps you become interested in the article and then helps lead you on to continue and read the facts and the stastistics the author starts out by saying ' grab your telescope look up into the sky it's a comet it's a meteor ' this grabs your attention and gets you to read the article the author then continues and starts to lead you into the facts and the information they would like you to read the author organizes it in a way that makes you read the entire article
23604,9,1,he organizes it by starting off with what the article is about then moving through to what exactly it is he is talking about where some of what he is talking about came from and why it is important
23605,9,2,first the author states an interesting fact about space junk and then explains that it is a concern for astronauts the author explains what space junk is and how it got up into space then explains what impact the space junk could have on space stations and other technology up there lastly the author expresses that even the smallest things up in space can pose a threat to man made technology up in space no matter how small the junk may be it can still cause damage
23606,9,0,he gets your a
23607,9,1,he tells you what the article is about then he tells you about the main topic then he tells you how space junk is a problem lastly he tells you how small things can become a big problem
23608,9,1,the author organizes the article like this because he wants to explain what space junk is then how it got there and what happens when it breaks up in space what is the causes of it in space how we can take care of it
23609,9,2,the author organizes his article by putting a title over each section he does this first by talking about the 'orbiting junk' and then by 'what is space junk ' and so on and so fourth
23610,9,2,first the author seperates the article into sections by using section headers this tecnique is usually the best for dividing up article information the author then uses a persuasive attention getter to grab the reader's attention in the beginning then goes off to tell what it is and where it came from basically it is a well organized informative essay you can tell that it is informative by the way it uses facts and true details to explain the situation
23611,9,1,the author organizes it by obseving what is happening in space and that things in space travel very fast and are very dangerous every once in a while some of the debris will get scattered around and will cause harm to the enviroment plus the soviet union was the first to launch an artificail sattelite and the united states followed shortly after
23612,9,0,the author gose in order with what relly happens
23613,9,1,the author organize this article be seperating each kind of problem by putting them in their own category also he discussed different type of space problems
23614,9,2,the author organizes the passage by an introduction into some of the common things that can be found in orbit around the planet then the author tells us about the history of countires sending artificial satellites starting with telling us about when the first one was launched next is the explanation of can happen when satellites in space collide in the febuary of 2009 two satelites one american and one russian bith collided with eachother both of the satellites where considered disabled and would've been much easier to remove if they were still in solid pieces now they will be very hard to clean up due to the collision finally the author explains how speed can affect the force of how hard an object will hit something in space even tiny particles will cause some major damage the author refers to a gentle breeze blowing sand to using a sand blaster to remove paint off of a concrete wall to give us an accurate picture of what can happen
23615,9,1,the author organized it by started it of intresting with a catchy hook to get the readers attention then the author slowly got more serious he started talking about space junk history to infor the ready about what is going on up in space after that he started issuing the problems with space junk
23616,9,1,the author starts the article with a humorous hook to draw the readers attention the article says 'grab you telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor it's a tool bag ' this quote is humorous and simplifies the complex problem of space pollution so that anyone could understand that it's a problem the author then moves into the history of space junk and how pieces of junk came to be orbiting the earth it starts out sayaing 'in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite ' the facts that the author gives explain how the problem came to be and gives a brief history of space exploration the author then moves on to describing the risk of satellites colliding into one another and gives examples of such times he also explains how other debris is created the article reads 'two communications satellites one american and one russion both traveling at more than 20 000 miles per hous crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth ' the historical story he uses helps to prove his points the end of the article is the persuasive part telling why all of the facts he has shown us are significant and why space pollution is undeniably a big deal the article reads 'yet the problem is certain to persist in fact the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration ' the persuasive techniques he uses leaves us concerned and wondering about how space pollution could affect us
23617,9,0,the author organizes the article by what he thinks is more important he describes things with words like garbage junk and crash course he starts off with the history then goes on with the rest of the information about the planets and space
23618,9,0,the author organize the article by grabing the reader ettention in the essy
23619,9,1,the author has it organizd because he has differnt titles everything is majority in the right places and a certain order the facts are in a cerntiain part of the story it also gives alot of information and information you need for the article

23621,9,1,the author tells the readers that sometimes the human race are polloting the space with garbage and other junk
23622,9,0,i think the article is very mixed around
23623,9,0,he organizes it to let the reader know whats going on in each paragraph he keeps it organized well keeping the reader from being confuzed he does this by keeping related things together
23624,9,2,the author first starts out with a good attention getter to get you woundering what space junk is second they tell you what space junk is third they tell you what can happen with all the space junk fourthly the say why such a little thing can be a big problem
23625,9,1,he first trys to grab your attention by saying 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor ' then he asks a question leading into the rest of the story he then gives you some background about spacecrafts about what has been sent beyond earth's atmosphere he also mentions how junk it shot through our atmosphere which can be highly dangerous that bring you to the next paragraph he then describes how we have no control of what is going to happen if it is not in our atmosphere it picks up speed and can come crashing down to earth these peices might be little but at a high speed rate it is dangerous because of the impact
23626,9,0,the author organize it in a detailed and orderly fasion
23627,9,0,for thing that are not all that importanit to things that are imopornait
23628,9,0,the author organized the article to follow a pattern the author started with an ancedote about it then told what is is then showed that they crashed into each other then told what the debris could to other space craft
23629,9,2,the author uses subtitles to organize the article before certain paragraphs at the left hand side is a bolded subtitle for example before the author gets into defining 'space junk' there is a subtitle labeled 'what is space junk ' also before the author tells about the microdebris in space there is a title labeled 'little bits but a big deal '
23630,9,1,the author organizes his article by puting them in date order he also tells us about how the space jumk is and like how it causes pollution to the plantent
23631,9,2,the author first makes you aware of what orbits in space then he or she illustrates what could happen to all of that debris in the final paragraph the author shows that even though the debris is small it is still really dangerous and closes with a paragraph talking about how space pollution is a persisting issue
23632,9,2,the author puts it in order from the events are happening first it starts with different information about it and what is going on secondly it tells you the risk and chances of satellites colliding with each other thirdly they let you know that small problems are happening but it is a big deal last it explains that problems are still existing and the amount of space crash is increasing
23633,9,2,first the author uses a clever anecdote to catch the readers attention then he defines the problem that he will disucss in the article next he gives the reader background information on the subject of 'space junk ' after that he gives an example of how past problems with satellites finally he states the continuing issue that must be avoided and what is being done to solve it
23634,9,0,he organizes it by describing what 'space junk' is and how it can turn into a big deal for astronauts out in space
23635,9,2,the author organized the article by trying to catch the reader's attention first once they had done that they would organize all of their information based on categories of relevance starting off by explaining what exactly they were talking about in this case it was space junk and they defined it under a specific title explaining what it was from there out they used the same sort of technique talking about how collisions are usually caused how powerful the impacts of the microdebris could be and gave each portion very clear titles that made it all easy to locate what you were looking for
23636,9,0,the author is trying to give simple data to learn more about space junk
23637,9,2,the author first gets the attention of the reader then the author informs the reader what space junk is and the way it got there the author then explains how the amount of space junk has grown from two satellites crashing and a tool bag being lost by an astronaut within the past three years the author then finishes the article by explaining how even the smallest bits of space junk can cause serious damage and how he hopes that nations can work together to solve this issue
23638,9,0,the author declaired his opinion to readers to believe his thinking
23639,9,1,the author starts by giving a little background or history on the topic then he or she moves onto to provide examples finally the author provides details on the danger of space junk
23640,9,1,the author organizes this article in seperate sections covering a more specific aspect of the main idea the article is opened with an interesting hook and followed by an introduction paragraph that gives a background on the topic the author changes their tone from comical to serious during the transition between the introduction and the main paragraphs the author has a title for each individual section of the article which makes it easier to find and classify the information in the article the author also makes the writing interesting enough to keep readers' attention but at the same time delivers important information
23641,9,1,the author organizes the article so that the reader can read along how space junk all got started to how it gets there and what occurs if they collide into each other to saying what the problem causes
23642,9,1,the author organizes the article into section exlaining the harm of space debris
23643,9,2,in this article the author organizes each section begining with either a question or the topic in which the section is about to explain for example 'crash course' explains the colliding of satellites
23644,9,2,the author organizes the article in sub articles like what is space junk or crash course this makes things easier to read and it makes things a lot easier to find this also makes the article a lot more organized and easier to read
23645,9,1,the author organizes the article by topics
23646,9,2,the author organizes the article in a scructure that assists in explaining the situation and convincing the reader of the possible dangers that space junk poses the author begins with statements that grap the reader's attention and introduce the topic being addressed next the author begins the section called 'what is space junk ' and he describes the history behind space exploration and how the idea of space junk has become a serious problem today then the author provides the reader with a specific example of how harmful and serious space junk can be the author finishes by explaining how difficult the situation is and how both nasa and the european space agency are both working on finding ways to avoid prevent and get rid of space junk
23647,9,1,he orginized the artical by using sub headings and sectioning the information out
23648,9,1,the author did a very nice job on organazation they had an interesting introduction they also didn't take anytime though to get right to the point they explained the serious matter in little sections to focus on certain parts there were different issues for different sections they were very informative i think they backed up their informantion well with supporting details facts
23649,9,2,the way the author organizes this article is by starting off with an interesting introduction to catch the readers attention the the author moves on to explain what space junk really is andto explain what they meant by the tool bag in paragraph 2 the author then moves on to the danger of satellites with no one in control of them the author finally closes with a few paragraphs to show why this article was important to talk about
23650,9,2,the author organized the article by having an introduction and putting the information into different catagories the catagories use were 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal'
23651,9,2,the author organizes the article by first explaining to the reader what this space junk is then telling how it is created and finally explaining how this space junk is very dangerous and should be prevented to first inform the reader the author gives a little bit of history about space travel and then explains how space junk is created the second part of the article then is used to explain a situation about how a crash of dead sattelites can create space junk in the last part of the article the author gives information on why this space junk really is bad and harmful the auhor finally ends the last part by telling us that there needs to be a way to try to find a solution to stop space pollution
23652,9,1,he organizes it by giving some information then he gives some history about space exploration he then tells about the terms and other minor things involved with space junk
23653,9,1,the author does a great job in organizing this article he organizes it so all his information leads to his point of the article he explains what is going on is space by first giving some history of the problem then he gets to the main point of the problem and explains how dentremental it really is to space and the environment
23654,9,2,the author oraganizes this article by explaining what space junk is then telling how it occurs and then going on to say how it affects the the atmosphere in outer space and astronauts examples of this are one the first paragraphs after the introduction are about what space junk is the second paragraph is about how space junk happens and the final paragraph is about how space junk affects the atmosphere and astrnauts
23655,9,1,the author organizes this article with an intresting introduction and later states different sections that include diffrent information for those topics
23656,9,1,at first it begins to explain what space is like now with all the cluttered junk and what it was decades ago in paragraph five it slowly begins to tell you how serious the junk is in our atmosphere and how harmful it is to our planet earth in paragraph eight it asks 'so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash ' the next paragraph explains who does and why
23657,9,2,the author begins the article 'orbiting junk' with a comment on something seen in space they ask what it is and they find that it is a tool bag which seems absurd since it is in space the author then moves on to describe exactly what is space junk he includes a little history regarding space operations as well as their purpose and the negative outcome they can have the autho then goes on to state the dangers of dead satellites in space as they can crash into each other he uses two example the first one is the crash of a russian and american satellite crashing into each other creating debris left in space the second one being the tool bag which escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repairs the author's conclusion highlights the dangers of the debris in space and what they can do he aslso includes that the problem is getting worse but agencies hope to work together to reduce space pollution
23658,9,0,the author gives us details about the space
23659,9,2,the author of this article organizes his detail in a introduction three pharagraphs on his main points and a conclusion the introduction being attention to the atricle and makes you wonder about space junk the next three main points are 'what is space junk' 'crash course and little bits but a big deal all three of these paragraphs are explaining what the author is trying to write about in this aticle the last point of the atricle the conclusion is to make you wonder about and make you want to do something about space junk and what is going on and how we can do something to make it go away
23660,9,2,the author organizes the article into four different sections that each describe a different aspect of his topic 'orbiting junk ' he begins with an introduction that captures the reader's attention before taking on a serious tone to convey his message in the section titled 'what is space junk ' the author explains what it is he will be talking about and where it comes from the author then goes on to describe the dangers of space junk in the last two sections 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal '
23661,9,2,the author uses the introduction to grab the readers attention in the second paragraph the author defines space junk and uses the history of space junk in the third paragraph the reader talks about the risk of space junk finally in the last paragraph the reader talks about how scientists are trying to solve the problem
23662,9,0,the author organizes tthe article in a tragic to not
23663,9,2,the author organized the article in an explaining order first the author grabs the readers attention by talking about a tool bag in the sky the in the section 'what is space junk ' the author expalins what the 'junk' is that is orbiting as the author moves into 'crash course' the author talks about a true incident that happened in february 2009 in the ending section the author uses 'little bits but a big deal' to sum up that the space junk may be small but it is a big deal and serious
23664,9,1,the author organizes the article by introducing what is space in the junk the author gives us specific information about the satellites then the author beggins to tell us it problems and ho wdoes it affects us
23665,9,0,the author of 'orbiting junk ' is explaining that there is junk in space that can come doen to earth that can made more damage that can have more damage but with more smaller junk can't be seen
23666,9,0,they show the facts first and tell you what could happen
23667,9,0,the author organizes the artical by
23668,9,0,he organizes it well he stays on task from going from one subject to another the article is nice and clearly to read
23669,9,0,he putsthe story together piece by piece so it all fits in perfect
23670,9,0,from dangerous to most dangeous
23671,9,2,the author organizes the article ina very logical way they start out with a kind of story to grab the readers attention and when their attention is directed to that certain point the author starts to explain it the author startes with how people began getting into space and how space junk ends up in orbit and ends that section by telling how satelites that malfunctions or breaks goes on an uncontrolled orbit the next section explains the results when two such uncontrolled satelites collide explaining that they create millions of tiny pieces of space junk they end the article then explaining why the pieces of space jusnk which are so small actually make a difference
23672,9,1,the author organizes this article by telling how space junk and space exploration is harmful it also goes in order from the smallest to the biggest problems that need to be taken care of
23673,9,1,the other organizes it by telling you what it is then it tells you how they become uncontrolled orbits and can have risks of colliding with eachother which can be very harmful to us becasue they go at really fast speeds then it explains how they try to control that but they cant do much but watch them
23674,9,1,the author organizes the article with mind grabbing statements then explaining what space junk is how it is created how it can crash and what impact it makes
23675,9,1,the author organizes the article by telling the information to the reader in order and is not all scrambled up the author talks about space junk and what it is he tells us what it does and how it acts in space then he talks about its crash course and about how the little pieces of rock can cause serious damage to the spacecraft
23676,9,2,the author organizes it by telling you what 'space junk' is and then he goes back and says whay it does to effect us people do not realize what harm it could have
23677,9,2,to begin the author grabs the reader's attention with an interesting introduction he she then adresses the problem about 'space junk' in the next section the author explains what exactly 'space junk' is and gives some background information on it the next section explains the dangers of the floating dead satellites and gives an example 'in 2008 a tool bag escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repais on the internationaal space station' in the last section he she describes what scientists are trying to do to solve the persistent and increasing problem that is 'space junk'
23678,9,0,the author talks about how bad space junk is he gives souportive detaels about why its bad
23679,9,2,the autor organizes the article by making different headlines for different topics they set out certain bullet points that they want to talk about and then once they've mentioned the problem in the headline then they go into more detail about it they have three different things that they talk about specificaly one being 'what is space junk the second being 'crash course' and the third being 'litlle bits but a big deal ' the autor makes this an easy read becasue you don't have to read the whole thing to find what you're loooking for because they broke it up into diferent topics and into different paragrapghs
23680,9,0,the author organize the article because you should grab your telescope and look up the sky to see a planet that the satellite would crash another satellite to cause a space pollution try to protect the outer space
23681,9,2,the author organized the article in a sequence of events ranging from how the satellites got into space to how they crash and then tells the reader of the broken satellites severity to other space crafts in orbit the author also labeled the paragraphs with specific titles that forshadowed what you was going to be reading next
23682,9,2,the author at first gives you some background information on the space race between russia and the united states he then talks about how the satellites that were launched need repaired or sometimes crash into each other which is a cause of the 'space junk ' the author then ends the article by telling us the danger and damage this little fragments can cause
23683,9,2,the author organizes by descibing space junk the how space junk can collide with other space junk thus explaining how the collisions leave debris and cause a problem
23684,9,1,the author organizes the article into different sections to emphasize specific details about a topic and give detailed information about individual topics
23685,9,0,he puts every thing in logical order
23686,9,1,the author of 'orbiting junk' organizes the article with subtitles subtitles allow the reader to sort of know what the next few paragraphs will be about and make it easier to find certain information throughout the article
23687,9,2,the auther organizes the articles by titles about what he wants to talk about like in the article ' what is space junk ' he she talks about space junk and how it effects our admisphere and the rocketships in space in the article 'crash course he she talks about how two satellites crsh into one anouther and how it effects the atmosphere and how it will cause truble in the fouter for spaceships
23688,9,1,he starts with the first satellite being launched and how much space has changed since then
23689,9,1,the author organizes the article by giving the readers background information about the crashes in the past then it gives us information from the debris from the crashes between the satellites
23690,9,2,first the author gives an interesting statement that grabs the reader's attention then they explain what the space junk is they explain how space junk can become disabled objects and can circle the goble uncontrollably next they tell how these disabled objects can create crashes that disassemble the ojects into tiny fragments finally they state that the problem will continue and the space trash will increase causing harm that needs a solution
23691,9,2,the author starts with a introduction then the author describes what space junk is next the author talks about how space junk can be created finally the author talks about how important it is that we try to solve the space junk problem
23692,9,1,he organize by history first then tell about the course they take then its about trash in space last it give you information about space pollution
23693,9,0,the author organizes the article in how the outer space is and what is going wrong with it
23694,9,2,the way they organize this article is by explaning what space junk is to inform the reader then they explain the effect it has and why its a problem to our space program then at last they give deatils about how it dangours and why we should do something about this problem
23695,9,2,the author organizes the article by different concerns for example the first section 'what is space junk ' describes what 'space junk' is and how it negatively affects the environment the second section 'crash course' describes how the colliding of satellites affects the amount of microsatellites 'flying through space' which proposes a huge problem for astronauts trying to maneuver around them the last section 'little bits but a big deal' describes that while the space debris may be very small they can pose a lot of damage on other spacecrafts which could ultimately jeopardize the safety of astronauts
23696,9,0,he organizes it by first trying to get peoples attention with the type of sentences he uses in the begining then gets serious by trying to convince how important this actuall y is to him and the enviornment then continues that same importance through out the article
23697,9,1,he starts out with a senario where someone sees a tool bag in space then he goes on to list statistics and facts about space exploration along with this he gives some startling facts such as satellites crashed while going 20 000 miles per hour finally he rapped it up with a conclusion that this is a growing issue and has to be solved
23698,9,2,the author organizes this article by dividing it up into topics in order to capture the reader's attention the author starts by drawing in the reader's imagination and then informs him or her that this is a serious issue right after the introduction the author knows he or she has the reader's attention and starts informing them of space junk before all the information can bore the reader the author changes the topic to crash course this causes the reader to wonder if satellites really crash in space the author finishes off by telling the reader that this is a serious issue but keeps the mood light by saying there is a tool bag loose in space this keeps the reader interested and wanted to read more without getting too bored with all the information
23699,9,2,the author organize the article by brecking it down into peices by using the names orbiting junk what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal by using this like that it makes the reader wanna read this stuff so ya it makes it istering
23700,9,1,the author organizes the article by grabbing the readers attention at the begining paragraph using startling statistics after the author has got the readers attention they take the rest of the article into serious matter to explain the dangers of 'space junk'
23701,9,2,he organizes it in sub articles such as 'crash course'
23702,9,1,the author organizies his work by the smallest problem to the biggest problem for example in 'orbiting junk' it is explaining the facts about space junk in 'what is space junk ' it's telling you about space junk in 'crash course' it is explaining about the colliding of the two satelites with each other then in the last section 'little bits but a big deal ' it is showing how that is a serious problem to the other satellites in the air
23703,9,0,he goes from present tense to past tense to provide an example then goes to future tense to say what could hapen if space junk gets worse
23704,9,2,the author first has an attention grabber to get the interest of the reader the author then states a fact and states reason for the fact then the author explains about satellite crashes and free orbiting satellites the author then puts in the question 'so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash ' to get the author to think then the author ends the article by restating the problem and stating a fact about how people are trying to solve it
23705,9,1,it organize the article telling the readers what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal its letting readers know whats going on in outterspace most people believe that outterspace may not be as dangerous but the narrator is trying to persuade the readers outterspace is more dangerous than being on earth
23706,9,2,the author organizes the article in a simple yet structured way fortunately for a topic such as this the author seperates main ideas into their own sections such as crash course and little bits big problem this type of article is easy for anyone to read and especially easy to find the information you are looking for in a quicker way opposed to perhaps looking it up in an encyclopedia
23707,9,1,the author organizes the article by explaining what space junk is and what it can do to earth and surrounding satellites then the autho goes on to explain about why space junk is going to increase
23708,9,2,he puts it in groups or in indevidual sections like 'what is space junk'
23709,9,2,it gives me brief information about the article startng the article off with some hurmor 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor it's a tool bag ' then goes into the begining about how the 'soviet union launched the first artificial satellite the united states followed suit and thus began the human race's great space invasion ' it goes on about what happens when tools float off into space by itself and how it could be really dangerous the conclusion just states that hopefully in the future scientist can come up with a solution about how to solve the space pollution problem
23710,9,2,the author uses subtitles to tell the readers what the following infermation will be about the author has a funny or interesting subtitle for each section of information he uses these subtitles to orginize his article under the subtitle 'crash course' the author tells about a collision that happend these subtitles give the readers something to think about before the read that specific section of the article the author uses subtiles to help orginize the information in the article
23711,9,1,he made this article organized by labeling sections of this article so that what we need to find is by looking for the header for each paragraph
23712,9,0,it explains the dangers of the space junk
23713,9,1,the author puts certain information under certain titles
23714,9,0,the author organizes this article by drawing you in with personal anecdotes and then becoming serious with the matter at hand with 'space junk' by using facts and statements about it
23715,9,2,the author organizes the article by first defining what 'space junk' is and then saying what causes it and last by telling us how big of a deal it is and how much harm it can do the paragraphs are titled by what it is going to tell you in the third paragraph it explains how the objects crashing make debris and in the fourth it explains the damage they do
23716,9,0,they try to catch your attention by saying thing exiting and then it's a let down they are trying to get you to think about what it really is
23717,9,2,the author orginzes the article in to four catigories 'what is space junk' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal'
23718,9,2,the author organizes this article by explaining different problems with orbiting space junk in each section the author gives a section on what space junk is how satellites are in space and how microdebris can cause a big problem in space the author gives a sequential order and provides detail with each subject
23719,9,1,the author organizes the article by first introducing the reader to space junk and explaing what space junk is then the author describes cases where space junk can collide in crash courses and the dangers from this the author also explains how size can impact crash courses and then concludes the article with the bad effects of space junk and what can be done to fix the problem
23720,9,1,he rconizeses it but writing biout space junk
23721,9,1,the author organized this article by first grabbing the readers attention then he breifly explained the meaning of the article by telling the readers what 'space junk' is he then went on to explain how space junk is a problem
23722,9,1,the author organizes it so that 1 the basic information is first introduced 2 the knowledge of how the satellites get up there and what could happen to them is given 3 the reader knows what could happen between two or more malfunctioned satellites and 4 the reader knows what harm the debris of two crashed satellites could do
23723,9,1,he organizes this article by breaking it down into things of importance by first explaining what space junk is then how important it is and how much it can effect us then by breaking it down to the sizes of the space junk
23724,9,1,the auther organize the artical by putting a title for each parograph with all the right information to make it easyer for the readed to understand also the parograph is orgainized by the dates and what happend
23725,9,0,the author organizes it in a proper manner it was mostley in order and never of the topic or the paragraph
23726,9,0,he give goods examples and then he uses alot of facts to back up what he was talking about he also uses alot of information about past accendets that happend in space cause of debris
23727,9,2,the author organizes this article in a very intelligent way first he uses a rhetorical question to start the introduction then he uses sub headings for the next paragraphs the first one is called 'what is space junk ' this paragraph defines space junk and explains how it is formed the next paragraph is called 'crash course ' this paragraph presents an example of a collision of space junk and how it is dangerous the last paragraph is title 'little bits but a big deal ' in this paragraph the author is explaining that even though most of space junk is relativley small it can still be dangerous at high speeds
23728,9,1,the author first captures the reader with the introduction by using related terms after the introduction the author gives background facts about space junk in the past the author also describes the seriousness of space junk and debris in the following paragraphs at the resolution the author describes how space agencies must come together and fix this serious issue and shows that space junk is a continuous problem
23729,9,2,the author separates his different information into groups by content in the block under 'crash course' there is related information about space satellite crashes which create space junk he separated all his convincing information into three different blocks of information to keep make it easier to understand and stay on track
23730,9,0,it does not expalain way they did it in the first place but what they did must of be good for the space program
23731,9,2,the author organizes the article by catching the reader's attention then informing them what space junk is the next section titled 'crash corse' explains how space debris is made and it lists specific examples such as the american and russian satellites crashing into eachother in 2009 in the last section the author explains why space debris are harmful and what is being done to help solve the problem
23732,9,2,the author organizes the article in a 'opening support conclussion' format this meaning that the first section titled 'what is space junk ' is clearly going to talk about what space junk is which will create a nice segway to talk about 'little bits but a big deal'
23733,9,0,the author emphasizes that space junk is harmful to the space atmosphere and if we didnt put more junk up therein space it would be much better
23734,9,0,i would think he organized this article in a consequence of what has happened and then has explained what caused the consequence in the first place it then tells about some of the major stories of flaws in the 'dead satellites'
23735,9,0,he star the question first then he move to another step
23736,9,2,the author organizes the article in three sections the beginning is a introduction or attention grabber to get you ready to read the report story each section explains something to do with the title 'orbiting junk' what is space junk crash course little bits but a big deal i prefer this form of organization as it is easier to read and understand
23737,9,1,the author makes sections to point out different informatioon about space satellites the author expresses different possibilites of what might happen in a few years and what has already happened because of there free orbiting satellites
23738,9,2,the author organizes the article with titles the name of the title gives the reader an idea of what the passages will be about what is space junk gives the reader an idea of the junk that's in space
23739,9,1,he first explains the history of space exploration such as the space race between the soviet union and the united states then he goes on to describe how much of the space junk comes from and how it can be dangerous to the spacecraft and satellites that continue to move around our atmosphere
23740,9,1,he does it with an introduction twosupporting paragraphs and a conclusion
23741,9,1,he organizes it by first getting your attention with cool facts he then moves on to the history about space satellites before moving on to the incidents that occur with these space junk peices from there he moves on to the facts about space junk then finaly he go ons about trying to find a way to get rid of or protect from the space junk
23742,9,1,having four sections in the article all talking about interesting facts from past experiences or problems with atmospheric conditions helps the reader stay interested
23743,9,1,it's saying that orbiting junk is something that matters to you you have to do somthing about it space junk is soviet union launched the frist artifical satellite over they years variety of spacecraft that may things can come to the world in no time problems is a certain to persist in the amout of what they are talkina about is diffcult to handle by there self with anyone problems we have ma have may problems in the world but this one is most difently a tru one
23744,9,1,the author puts the article into different sections he uses a different section to tell a different story or give different information
23745,9,2,the author organizes the article well she starts off with interesting facts and then comes to the real importance of the matter of the 'space junk' in orbit which is becoming a big problem and ends it with telling people to become more aware because the problem is increasing
23746,9,1,he first has his introduction and opening senetence and paragraph to really grip the reader into reading his article about 'space junk' then the author spilts the article into 3 different part and through these 3 parts he goes on and explains what space junk is how space junk happened and the events that may have caused it to appear in space and last why as people we should take 'space junk' a little more seriously
23747,9,1,the author states what space junk is then how the space junks occurs lastly finishes off with how much effect the space junk can cause the author says that many things have been shifted off beyonds earth's atmosphere then the author says that when satellites become useless they become dead and will crash with another dead satillite which will cause some mess the auther also says that the little mess can cause some much damage for beinging so small
23748,9,0,he organizes it by diffrenet tips of things that happen in space or about the spacecraft
23749,9,1,the author seperates each topic and it all appears very organized even when you read it it all flows together and works good as an article also the author keeps the information seperated and doesn't repeat the same things over and over again
23750,9,1,he organizes things in a chronological order crash course explains what happens when two orbiting bodies collide with one another little bits but a big deal explains what happens after a collision has taken place
23751,9,1,the author shows how we got to this problem of space debris they seperate each paragraph using bold faced words that flow into eachother the author also uses factual information to show this problem we have in space
23752,9,1,the auther put the artical in chronological order in the introduction the auther is getting ready in the second section the auther discribes how the dibry comes about in the third section it is discribed at to what usually happens to the debre whenit is in the free flow orbit this continues to what the posibilities are to going out into space and what the dangers are
23753,9,1,the author organizes this article by sections of information the author provides separate sections for the history of space junk how satellites and other object become space debris and how the little bits of debris can cause major damage to the atomosphere and earth
23754,9,0,the author organizes the article in cornilogical order
23755,9,0,to inform us of the harmful things floating in outerspace free orbiting space junk that has came into our atmospere and can make things a little dangerous for incoming collisions to earth
23756,9,2,the author organizes the article into three specific sections 'what is space junk ' 'crash coarse' and 'little bits but a big deal' each section provides important statistics on the topic
23757,9,2,the article is organized into sections first the author defines the matter then goes on about what causes the debris and finishes up with saying that the debris is a big problem
23758,9,1,the author organized the article by making different sections in the article each section has a different heading that lets you know what you can find in the area it makes it easier to read the article this way
23759,9,1,the author organizes the article in a way that seperates the different topics the author does this by making new paragraphs for different topics and giving headings for each topic
23760,9,2,the author organizes the article into different aspects of 'space junk ' for example the author uses uses the subtitle 'what is space junk ' to describe what 'space junk' is he or she also uses subtitles such as 'crash course' to explain a few extraterrestrial crashes this type of organization helps the article to remain as fluent as possible and to focus the reader on the negative effects of 'space junk '
23761,9,1,the author organizes it by telling the readers what it is in space how all the satalites work and what happens when they crash its all in order from the time they are in space when they release the satalites and when they crash to produce debris
23762,9,1,the author does well on organizing the information by seperating it into sections the author starts off the article with an introduction to cath the readers eye and draw them in then states what space junk is and facts about it towards the end the article is summarized so the readers get the just of the article
23763,9,1,the author organized this article in a great way the author tells what space junk is and then goes in to why it can be dangerous when we go into outerspace and why it is a big deal
23764,9,0,he starts with a grabber then he talks about space junk then tells you what we can do to cut down how much garbage we put in the atmosphere
23765,9,1,the author organizes the article by giving each subject he is talking about a sub heading and staying on topic he also uses lots of statistics and supports them all
23766,9,2,the author organizes this article by like ideas the introduction has a clever beginning to draw readers in and then the rest becomes more serious the second section 'what is space junk ' defines the subject to the reader so that they fully understand the article the third section 'crash course' shows the magnitude of the space junk with a specific instance on how it came to be the forth and final section summarizes all the previous sections and makes the point that space junk orbiting the earth really is a dangerous issue overall the author organizes the article in an easy to comprehend bit sized manner
23767,9,1,he puts it in very understandable terms instead of making it complicated and what not he made it so that the last paragraph can sort of link on to the other one
23768,9,2,it starts off with a attention getter to grab the reader's attention the author than creates a short passage providing information on what is being meant to talk about in the passage the first thing he does is provides information about what space junk is and a little information about the history behind it the author explains that space junk is what the soviet
23769,9,0,in to two driffent sections so he can better expalne what he is talkieng about
23770,9,1,the author organize the article by tellin how the space junk can be harmful the author is telling how the satellites crashed into each other and how the tool bag fell out the man hand
23771,9,0,the arthur organized the articale by
23772,9,1,they start off by grabbing the readers attention by using exclamation points and then go into the history of space junks they tell the reader that it is a serious matter
23773,9,2,the author of this story organizes this story in different sections the author has an introduction section telling about bad things orbiting our planet to help pull in the reader he then in the middle sections tells us what the problem is and how we can help fix it in the final section he raps everything up

23775,9,2,he stars with an interdoction to get you intersetes in space so look at the sky then he lets you know how much space junk is in space like satellites then it tells you how satellites crash in space then how people need to learn about the junk that can damage the spacecraft in space while traveling
23776,9,2,the author first states the problem then he expalins what the problem is by breaking it down into three parts thats why he he has a section called what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
23777,9,2,the author organizes the article by starting out w a famous pop culture reference that catches your attention then they get to the serious stuff in the introduction explaining the timeline and statistics of space travel so that the reader gets the idea of what he or she is reading about following the introduction is the body of the article that explains the main idea further then comes the conclusion that gives the author's opinion on the topic of the 'space junk' crisis
23778,9,0,the author is trying to tell us that space junk is very bad and can do harm to us humans and the evironment it also can cause problems to the astronauts in outer space
23779,9,0,he starts out with something that grabs the readers attention and then goes into some statistics with telling people how some microdebris can be very dangerous to telling about the american and russian crashing into each other at speeds faster than 20 000 miles per hour the authors tells a lot of information and gives some statistics about space travel
23780,9,1,the author organizes this article in the manner of how events occur he starts off with an intriguing introduction proceeds to tell us what space junk is tells us how it got there and finishes by explaining the complexity of the problem of space junk
23781,9,0,the author organizes the article by making it lie a joke in the beggining paragraph but then makes it more serious
23782,9,1,the author starts with and introduction then a description followed by an incident and ends with a reason for the incident the introduction grabs the readers' attention then the desctiption sets up the article for a conflict and a reason for the conflict to have occured
23783,9,2,the author starts out trying to get your attention with what may in the sky then the author begins telling about space junk and how the government have great concern about space junk they talk about the variety of spacecrafts space capsules telescopes and satellites that have been sent out beyond earth's atmosphere they also talk about how many satellites end up crashing into eachother also how little paticles or space junk moves 5 miles per second
23784,9,0,he orginizes by the level he thinks is important he wants to get a point across that it is a big deal if satellites crash because they can break down into many little parts and soon come onto earth's surface if it comes on earth's surface it can harm people's health
23785,9,1,the author uses intresting staements at the beginning to grab the readers attention this is shown because of the statment of the tool bag then the author tells about space junk and history it gives information about space junk and why it occurs lastly the article tells of the importance of the junk the author tells intresting facts that proves it is serious
23786,9,0,he puts the main facts first then makes the other important facts follow after
23787,9,2,the author first tells you about orbiting junk around space then the author proceeds to tell you what space junk is the author then tells you about what can happen to sattelites and space junk colliding the author also tells you how the little peices of debris is a big deal
23788,9,0,the author organized this article like a magazine organizes its articles
23789,9,2,the author organizes the article by sections each section going into more detail about different 'space junk' topics the first section informs the reader a basic explanation of what space junk is the next section titled 'crash course' explains the affects of having free orbiting disabled satellites flying through space the last section of the article 'little bits but a big deal' goes into detail about how microdebris lays a big impact on spacecrafts
23790,9,0,he thinks there is a problem with junk invloved with space craft and there is a such thing as junk and trash in the space
23791,9,2,the author organizes the article so that it is easy to follow and understandable someone who doesn't know anything about space exploration can easily know what the author is talking about and what message the author is addressing because of the organization the author first draws the reader in with the introduction and addresses the problem he then explains what space junk is the next section explains how space junk occurs and the article concludes with how big of a problem the small bits of microdebris can cause
23792,9,1,he put different sections in it and caught the readers attention in the begining
23793,9,1,according to the article the author organizes the article by putting catchy phrases to attract the reader to read into more of the passage then after a catchy introduction the author talks about what space junk is and how it is harmful to our satellites and how the debris affects earth
23794,9,1,it started off with one thing then went to the next it told us how bad space junk was this was when the soviet first put a satellite in space the crash course told about the satellite the satellite ran the risk of colliding into each other the little bits but a big deal told us what was important and what was not it showed us the serious problem told us about the tiny fragments traveling thre space
23795,9,2,the author organizes the article by putting it in headings he has headings such as what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
23796,9,2,the author organizes the article into three sections following the introduction these are titled 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' these sections help separate the different types of facts and make the article easier to read
23797,9,1,he has a new tittle for everything he is about to talk about
23798,9,1,the author organizes the article with a hook that interest the reader with bold statements states the main point with background information on satellites history and strong conclusion warning the reader about the dangers of the 'increasing' amount of space junk and suggests a solution to the problem
23799,9,2,well first he starts what an attention grabbing introducting immediately following he gets serious about his topic and explains just exactly what 'space junk' is he then proceeds to explain how satetites crashing at hish speeds creates all sort of space junk lastly he expresses his concern for the growing problem and staes that nasa is looking for a solution
23800,9,0,the auther tells us how important the space stuff is used
23801,9,2,the author organizes this article in a text book form with sections having titles what is sapce junk and then having information under the section titles it has facts backing up they're statements
23802,9,2,the article is organized in a chronological way the 'lifespan' of debris so to say the author talks about how satellites are freely moving about the earths orbit and will soon enough crash into one another this creates hundreds of microsatellites otherwise known as debris these debris are flying over 20 000 miles per hour and present a serious risk for anything that comes into contact with it's path of travel the author then concludes with a sort of 'look to the future' with commercial space programs which will only worsen the space pollution issue
23803,9,1,first the author describes what space junk is then gives you a short history of space explorations second we learn about the satellites themselves and about what eventually happens to them the authour tells us about satellites colliding in space once they 'die' and when they hit each other pieces of space junk come off besides satellites the author gives us another example of a tool bag from an astronaut who was doing repairs on the iss finally we are told about how just the smallest pieces of space junk can be dangerous 'if you find that hard to believe compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a snadblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall 'this gives us an example of something on earth to compare to the debris in space
23804,9,2,the author organizes the article by starting out the introduction with something that grabs the readers attention by then identifying the flying object in the sky as 'a tool bag ' it makes the reader want to read the article the author goes on by explaining what the meaning of 'space junk' is and how it gets there followed by what happen to satellites when they 'die ' the author finishes his her article by notifying the reader that space junk is a big deal and is 'increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration '
23805,9,1,the author organizes the article by using bold headings to catch readers attention
23806,9,1,the author first catches your attention with the introduction the author then explains how space junk is formed and next why it poses a problem in space the last passage explains the seriousness of the space junk in order to drive the point home
23807,9,1,the author organizes this article by importance first he grabs the attention of the reader and then leads into background detail about space junk the author then provides a paragraph that explains the dangers of satellites lastly the author ties it all up and explains that there are many people who care about a serious problem
23808,9,1,there are many bold faces titles in the artical to show which each one is about
23809,9,1,he put it in year order he put a title above each section
23810,9,2,after the introduction the author starts by describing what this 'space junk' is by talking from when the first satellite was launched to the supposedly hundreds of little junk satellites scattered around orbit 'crash course' explains a story about a crash in space that left debris in space and that these accidents can happen at any time in space the last part talks about how this debris is dangerous despite its size
23811,9,2,the author oraganizes this artices very well he starts out by telling us what space junk really is and how it works next he would tell us about microsatellites and how they are used at last he talked about tiny bits of space trash so over all he did really well oragnizing this article
23812,9,0,the article is organized in a flowing manner it starts by giving a point goes through the body by describing what the narrator means by it and ends in a call to action
23813,9,1,the author organizes the article by first stateing what space junk is then gentally flows in to how it is a potentailly dangerous hazard for other space explorations and how this matter needs to be taken seriously
23814,9,0,when people think of space they don't think about all the junk that is in it when we look up into space we dont see all the junk that is in it either but what we don't see is a problem when they try to tell us that there is junk in space most people don't believe it and all the stuff falls down to earth nut most of it don't i think it's sad that there is a mess in space a place that should be untouched
23815,9,0,they tell us that we should look though a telescope and look thought it there is 33442 satellite the size of a baseball anything goes smaller this makes it difficult for spacecraft to steer clear of microdebris fields
23816,9,1,the author organizes the article from information of the past of space junk to information of the present and how dangerous it can be for example it starts off in the first part stating 'over the past 52 years earth's atmosphere ' this shows the variety and past of spacecraft the next part helps to better explain how dangerous satellites may become because of the risk they have of running into one another this part leads into the present then finally it shows that how serious space debris is by statating 'those bits of space debris present a very serious problem ' the way the article is wrote is to show the effects of space activity
23817,9,1,the author organizes the article very well the author starts with getting your attention he then gives background information on space next the author tells how the debris in space becomes uncontrolled finally the author says how small the debris can be and that this is a big problem
23818,9,2,the author first starts out with shocking statements to get the readers attention then the author gets serious with facts about how space exploration has cluttered space after that the author describes how satellites 'die' and crash into each other creating microdebris next the author goes to explain the how little pieces of debris known as microdebris can be just as harmful as big pieces of debris and finally the author proposes answers to the problem of cluttered space
23819,9,1,the author organizes the article first with a light engaging introduction followed by background information further explanation of risk and conclusive descriptions of the problems and what is being done about them
23820,9,0,the author organizes the article in chronological order starting with the introduction and background information followed by the current problem and then how the problem will most likely persist in the future
23821,9,1,the author organizes the articals by headings
23822,9,1,the author uses subtitles to make to article different from others
23823,9,1,he begins by telling us what 'space junk' is and then tells us why it is harmful and what harm it can cause in the end he tells us how scientist are working on a way to fix the 'space junk' problem
23824,9,2,at first the author gives a great explanation on what he or she is going to talk about he or she starts to explain that space junk is bad for the globe then the author starts to explain what the space junk is it is the human race's great space invasion of the soviet union and the united states satellites that have been launched in space the next set of information explains the crash course of the satellites if the satellites come near eash other then they will crash into each other and then our country would not be able to have that control anymore the next information the author talks about is the tiny bits of space trash or also called space junk that is in space floating around
23825,9,0,he organizes it by what is more important to them and they go from there
23826,9,0,the author starts with 'what is space junk' which tells of space missions and how we 'invaded' space then it tells of satellites and how they can crash then of microdebris
23827,9,0,he puts it together by telling one problem after another
23828,9,1,he puts it into interesting paragraphs and also puts it into interesting caterogies
23829,9,2,the author organizes this article in an easy to understand and well planned way the author has chosen to set it up by and seperate the paragraphs by sections not just spacing and indenting the author started with background information then transitioned into information about how free floating satellites and then concluded with statistics and information from nasa and other space agencies about how space exploration should be done in a more organized and clean way
23830,9,1,the authoe organizes this article in a series so titled paragraphs the fact that each section of paragraphs tells you what thoes will be talking about it gives you a little clue as to what you will be reading
23831,9,1,he puts the article into sections he is not just jumping around form subject to subject he gives a title and the article or the section follows it below the title
23832,9,2,the author organized it by getting your attention at the beginning by 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor it's a tool bag ' then the author told the reader about space junk and the risk it causes like dead satellites at the risk of colliding with each other then the author lets the reader know that space junk is a big deal and people do care about it
23833,9,1,in different paragraphs about different things
23834,9,1,the author put the article under three main topics after the introduction under each topic he describes that topic with a lot of useful information
23835,9,1,the author splits the article into groups of two to four paragraphs the author wants to make it easier to write the article and to help the audience find specific topics in the article there is a lot of information in this article that could easily make the author lost when he or she is writing and it can make the audience lost easily as well when they are reading the article the author also makes the organization of the article even easier when he makes the titles of the section in big and bold letters so the sections that somebody may be looking for may be easily found i think that the article would be confusing as a reader if there were no divisions and sections in this article
23836,9,0,he organizes it so you better understand the issue if space junk and little bits no big deal were switched you would have no idea what was being said
23837,9,2,the author organizes the article by putting titles or what is going to be talked about above the paragraph one example is 'little bits but a bid deal ' the author talks about how much people really care about the lost tool bags or the tiny bits of space trash
23838,9,0,by good details
23839,9,1,the author organizes the article by using a catchy way to bring in the attention of the reader lines 1 4 illistrate this then the author begins to use facts and statistics to show how serious this topic was this was the authors main goal it seemed to show the reader 'space junk' is a serious matter
23840,9,2,the author organizes this article he starts with the intoduction telling what it is about and then he gives a background on space junk and early space explorations the writer then proceeds to tell about how space juk becomes space junk and then goes on to tell why it is harmful and dangerous and why we should worry about it
23841,9,1,the author organizes the article by using subheadings to seperate the different main ideas that he has in each of the subheadings the author gives a different idea and gives additional information that will give support to the idea it gives the reader different categories that related information will fall under
23842,9,1,the author organizes the article by informing us of the dangers of space junk the author gives us details the hazards they briefly inform us of the history and provide us with a real life example the author states 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise' paragraph 11 this proves how dangerous space junk is
23843,9,0,he organizes it by what happened to the satellite during the colision what was going on before it happened and what will happen now after the colision
23844,9,1,the author breaks down the information in to multiple sections it says what each section is about and sets the tone
23845,9,0,how he organize the article was really good he did it like that to catch our attention and how he worded it
23846,9,2,he uses sub headings such as 'what is space junk' and 'crash course'
23847,9,0,they state alot of facts
23848,9,2,the author organize the article by using headings that tell what the section will be about like the heading 'crash course' that tells you that this section will be about something that is crashing into something
23849,9,1,the auhtor organizes this article in chronilogical order first comes discovery of such junk in space then comes the explaination of why stuff is in space after that comes the resaon why such junk is created then the article explains how a little piece of junkcan do alot of damage last but not least they give information on what nasa and the european space agency plans to do with the junk in space
23850,9,0,he organizes it by starting out with action statments to get the readers attention then he goes in and explaing what soace junk is as well with a few good stories
23851,9,2,the author organizes the article into three different sections the first one is to explain what space junk really is because some readers might not understand the concept of it 'crash course ' shows why space junk is important the author used many details like the collision between a russian and an american satellite in february 2009 to show that this is a serious problem the next section titled 'little bits but a big deal ' explains that small or large fragments floating uncontrollably in earth's orbit is a serious issue space junk should not be considered a minor matter
23852,9,1,the author organizes the article in a way that helps readers get the main idea and important aspects of each topic on a simple level
23853,9,1,the author organizes the article by separting each topic into sections and giving them a title this makes it easier to find information from the article and easier to read
23854,9,0,he organized it really surpeirior well the cool things he did in this subject story was that he orgainzed with amazing statistics and other great facts about how much danger can space junk be
23855,9,1,the author organizes the article with tittles for sections and details all organised together
23856,9,2,the authors organization of the paper is into clearly labeled pertinant sections each section relates to the main idea which is that there is waste orbiting in space the section labeled 'what is space junk ' describes where all the garbage orbiting the planet has come from 'crash course' describes the collisions of satelites in space and also a funny incident including an astronaut the final section talks about the size of the objects orbiting earth does not matter because the speed is what causes the most damage
23857,9,2,the authorstarts off the article by saying what space junk is then he goes into how it all began and how some satillites will collide into each other some time causing big collisions at the end the author supports how this is a big deal and that we need to start preventing these dangers
23858,9,0,the author organizes this article by usingbuilding the argument layout
23859,9,1,he puts a title over every paragraph he puts something else like in space junk he talks about how space junk got up there
23860,9,1,the author starts with an easy going introduction that gets the readers attention the author then goes on to tell the reader what kinds of space junk there is what is really orbiting in space next the author explains to the reader how the satellites crash and debris is formed the author concludes with telling us that although people care about space debris and it causes many problems the problem is only getting worse the way that the author organizes the article is that he or she starts with minimal importance to their words as the article goes on the words become more important
23861,9,1,the author organizes it by naming each of the articles a different name it makes it more easlier to find the certain article
23862,9,0,he starts out informational then gets more deep into his true topic of conversation about the space junk
23863,9,1,the author organizes the article by using headings or topics for he or she has a lot of different information throughout the article the author wants the information to be organized in a way that the reader can understand it he or she has made it so that it's easier to go from one topic of information to the next
23864,9,2,the author organizes the article by making the first body parragraph 'what is space junk ' in that paragraph he explains the meaning of space junk in the second body paragraph he explains how collisions of the satallites make and become space junk in the last paragrapgh he titled it 'little bits but a big deal' meaning that even the little pieces of space junk can be a big deal the pieces are so little but yet so powerful
23865,9,0,he gradually gets more in depth of what space junk can do no matter what the size
23866,9,1,first it explains about the topic 'space junk ' then provides evidence that convinces the reader that its dangerous and then explains the importance of it
23867,9,0,scientists are hard pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk both the national aeronautics and space agency nasa and the european space agency
23868,9,1,the author organizes the article by using different titles by doing this he made it easier for the reader to understand
23869,9,1,the autor starts out with an attetion getter to make the reader want to read it then he goes into a sort of chronological order he starts with what space junk is 'what is space junk ' how it is made 'crash course ' and then why is can be dangerous 'little bits but a big deal ' no one would know what space junk is if the author just started with why it was dangerous
23870,9,1,the author organizes this article by he tells details about everything he talks about how the space junk is hurting earth he talks about the past and life experiences how this all started out by that austronaunt that lost a tool bag in space when fixing something and how it damaged the earth how little tiny things can damage the earth how those two satellites had a collusion and 491 miles per hour causing everything to get destroyed
23871,9,2,he explains every topic in a different section he begins with space junk which tells about junk and satellites he then explains other topic like crash course and other little things that fly in the air
23872,9,1,the author tells about space junk floating around are satellites the author is mostly concerned about the satellites
23873,9,2,the author organizes the article by putting things in order by the title at first the tells us what the orbiting junk is then explains a little about how it can cause a crash and then how we need to get these out of space the is how the author organizes this article
23874,9,0,the author starts off the paragraph that is designed to catch the readers attention from the beginning and keep them interested the supporting paragraphs to the article help explain the harmful effects of space debris and the purpose to the whole article and the conclusion again just simply explains the purpose of the article in a different type of writing
23875,9,2,how the author organizes the article is he puts different information into a different catergory for example the category 'crash course' is a section that talks about satellites crashing into one another
23876,9,1,the author uses heading in alazised bold font seperate from the original reading that explain what the following words mean
23877,9,1,the author definitely gets our attention with the gripping introduction but after that he starts telling us the history of space junk when he is done telling us about the history he then begins to tell us facts and statistics about the revelations that scientists and astronauts have concluded throughout the years
23878,9,1,he separates them into different sub headings
23879,9,1,the author organizes the passage by sections the sections are very detailed and get their piont acrossed
23880,9,1,the author orginizes the article by using headings for each part
23881,9,2,the author organizes the article by first using an introduction to get the reader's attention and to introduce the topic that will be discussed he then has paragraphs explaining what space junk is and a history of space junk the author uses his next few paragraphs to tell about a real life story that occurred due to this topic this story occurred in februaru 2009 when two communication satellites crashed creating more debris he does this to show the reader that this truly does have a large impact his next paragraph is used to compare space junk to objects in real life which will help the reader understand better the author then explains what people are doing to overcome this challenge such as adding walls to spacecrafts the last paragraph is the conclusion which is used to sum up what was said and to state that space agencies hope to come up with a sollution
23882,9,2,obviously it is convenient to read under the four headings presented within this article he begins with an exciting introduction to his topic before establishing his thesis about the dangers of 'space junk ' he then goes on to describe the history of the world's journey into the galaxy and touch on the unpredicted ramifications of such an adventure toward the end the author focuses on the modern problems created by space exploration and how it is imperative for them to be solved before considering future risks of more exploration
23883,9,2,he states that at one point the orbital pathway was once clear but due to spaced exploration it has become cluttered then the author points out who discovered space junk finally he concludes his story by telling the real danger and serios problems of space junk effecting our planet futurespace explorations and even nasa itself
23884,9,1,he has the intro to the article then he talks about what space junk is and how it can be dangerous then in the next section it talks about how the satellites can crash into each other and how a tool bag fell out of an space station he also talks about how space debris is a bad problem and how we have a lot of it the space trash is increasing
23885,9,1,the author organizes this article by stating the problem of space junk and giving extra sets of information about each thing before the author leaves you with conclusion at the very end
23886,9,1,the author organizes this article by separting each paragraph into different topics
23887,9,0,the author has organized this article in a cause and effect type of organization the author gives an effect and then follows it with its cause then the whole part of the statement is supported with details to make it an informative article
23888,9,1,the author organizes the article by introducing the topic and describing what it is then the author describes the problems that the ddebris has caused and what people are trying to do to fix it
23889,9,1,the author organize the article by titles he does it this way to tell the reader what heis going to be talking about he uses dates to signify when the debris and satellites were put into space
23890,9,0,in this story to organize things they sorted all the stuff out that they needed to put together so it isn't all in random places and so it all makes sense and none of it is out of wack
23891,9,0,the author uses forshadowing in the second paragraph of the article to emphisize how a little tool box is actualy a big problem it is well organized by what happens to objects taken up into space
23892,9,1,the author organizes it so that they talk about what space junk is first and then what happens if it is left alone they also tell a brief history of space exploration first and gets into more recent times at the end they talk about how space junk is becoming more of a problem
23893,9,2,he organizes it by first getting the reader's attention by using shocking statements in the introduction then the author tells the readers about what spack junk is exactly and how it becomes space junk then the author tells about because of so many 'dead' satellites they can crash into each other cause they are freely orbiting the earth then he or she states that even though after crashes in space and all the little pieces of the satelillets can still harm the earth because of how much speed is being increased
23894,9,0,he went by what happend first
23895,9,1,the author organizes the articles by first saying what a space junk is the united states followed suit and thats when the human race begun the objects themselves however are positioned hundreds of miles above earth the second thing he talks about is cash course where dead stellites run the risk of coliding with eacht other like in february 2009 not only spectacular crashes that create debris he continues to the section little bits but a big deal were it gets really serious when a tiny fragment traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft the amount of trash increasing has taken over
23896,9,2,the author makes everything build upon each other first the aurthor grabbed the readers attention second the author got more serious and showed people actually care about space junk then the author ended the article by give statistics and statements that make the reader notice the severity of space junk
23897,9,2,the author uses an 'attention getter' at the beggining of the article to draw readers in he then changes his tone to that of a more formal one underneath the title 'what is space junk ' he familiarizes you with what exactly space junk is next he uses 'crash course' to desribe the possible dangers of space junk in outter space lastly he emphasizes the seriousness of the problems space junk can cause
23898,9,0,the author organizes the article where you can easily find the information needed
23899,9,0,i think the story is organized in a informational kind of way at the begining the author starts off with an insteresting facts and throughout it it just tells about information
23900,9,0,it explains how the outerspace is from beggining to end
23901,9,1,he put it in ways that people could understand he made it in different sections so people wouldn't get confused
23902,9,1,the author organizes it into sections
23903,9,1,the author organizes the article by splitting it up into sub sections and having the title of each section give the reader a idea of what the paragraph is about
23904,9,1,the author organize the article by the main reasons and then the conclusion statements abiut it i know this because when the first paragraph starts with what is space which kind of briefly talks bout space junk and then it talks about how more microdebris is made
23905,9,2,the author organizes this article with an introduction into the topic followed by explaining the subject and the effects it holds the author explains the subject through the paragraphs titled 'what is space junk ' throughout these paragraphs the author gives examples of what space junk is as well as an example of what happens if 'space junk' were in the earth's atmosphere the author follows with a description as to what happens after satellites become space junk the author makes these description in the paragraphs of 'crash course ' throughout the paragraphs 'little bits but a big deal ' the author then explains the effects the space junk has on the spacecrafts sent into orbit
23906,9,1,tells us the danger about things floating out into space
23907,9,0,the author organizes this article by putting all different things about space when the author does that it shows that the author knows what he or she is talking about
23908,9,1,the article is organized by explaining what the problem is what causes it and why it is so important the first section 'what is space junk ' emphasizes what space junk is the second section 'crash course' tells the reader about how the space junk is created it talks about the collsion between two satellites that resulted in space junk the third section 'little bits but a big deal' tells the reader the threat of space junk
23909,9,0,he organizes it by ideas and a sort of time table his ideas lead into each other he starts with what it is followed be how it gets there then what it can do once it is there
23910,9,2,the author organizes this article 'orbiting junk' into specific sections he goes through the order you need to know things he gives you the background or history of space junk then he went into crasc course which is talking about craches that has happened over the years finally he gets omtp little bits but a bif deal and this section talks about how small something can be but make a big problem
23911,9,0,the author organizes the atricle by importance first he explains what space junk is then he explains crash courses then last he explains little bits of pieces that are big deals
23912,9,0,about the bags fall from space and it called space junk it might hurt the earth
23913,9,2,he grabs the reader's attiention in the introduction then explains what space junk is then how it gets to be junk in space the author then shows the big deal in space junk and why it should be solved
23914,9,1,in sections titled with question
23915,9,1,he first tries grabbing your attention and draws you in with a personal anecdote then talks about the orbital pathaways then he talks about space and the history of space and material used to examine space the author goes on talking about other stuff but he makes subtitles throughout the essay to organize his essay
23916,9,2,the author organizes the article by putting them into subgroups we start of with the orbiting junk subgroup which is the opening paragraghs next we move on to what is space junk which explains the history of space exploration it also talks about the problems with this though and how when a satellite 'dies' it just keeps going in space that is how we get space junk next we have crash course which focuses on one important crash that occured between two satellites this is important because it talks about one main important moment when space junk really became a problem last they have little bits but a big deal this part is the conclusion and talks about all the problems space junk can cause it gives us examples like in paragragh 10 about the lost tool bag this is important because it gives us a idea of just how dangerous this is so that is how the author organizes this well written article it helps keep it organized and makes it easier as a reader to read
23917,9,1,that these are very dangerous for satellites and rockets they get a lot of damage if its the size of a baseball or even smaller it can still be dangerous
23918,9,1,the author started it off a little funny but then it started to get serious he started to talk about the problems he compared it to a sand blaster and how sand can mess up concrete walls it just depends on how fast it is going
23919,9,2,he organizes this article by breaking it up on diffrent topics of the same subject for example under 'what is space junk ' he talks about the malfunctions and how satellites were first used under 'crash course' he talks about satellites and their possibilities of crashing or becoming a free orbiting satellite but under 'little bits but a big deal' it meantions about how tiny debris can cause serious problems
23920,9,1,the author organizes the article by explaining what it is giving examples and telling why it's important
23921,9,0,he explains space really well and has tons of answers for his own qoustions
23922,9,2,the author first catches your attention using the introduction in the introduction the author says 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor it's a tool bag 'then the author explains what the item of the topic is and how it got there the author says 'over the past 52 years a variety of spacecraft have been sent beyond earth's atmosphere ' after that the author explains the consepuences of the item by saying 'with no one at the controls dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other ' the author follows up by saying 'tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft ' the author closes his article by explaining the way the situation is being taken care of the author says 'space agencies hope that the corporations and nations invelved can work together to come up eith a viable solution to space pollution '
23923,9,1,the author organize the article starting with action 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor he was trying to get the readers attencion there then he explained what is the space junk crash course and the little bits but a big deal so people knew what he was talking about
23924,9,0,the author organizses the article by taking the events of the of the colliuons
23925,9,2,the author organizes it by dividing it into sections that reflect the size of the different types of space junk in the second section crash course the author explains the dangers of the larger debris while in the third section little bits but a big deal the author explains the dangers of small particles and objects to spacecraft
23926,9,1,the author starts with the history of 'space junk ' it starts with back in the 1950's what happened with this so called space junk he or she then tells of the dangers of space junk and the harmful things it can do lastly he or she talks about the destruction it caused up in space saying that two simple satelites can crash into each other and then form many many little pieces from that explosion means they can crash more often and cause more danger
23927,9,1,he starts off with an exciting start saying little interesting things about how lots of things such as satelites can cause problems in space he then slows it down showing the serious parts of wehat it can do to our space and orbit
23928,9,0,the author hooks the reader with catchy statements and then goes into facts the author thengoes into what happens in space then into whats causing the problems in space
23929,9,1,first it talks about the launching of space crafts and what is space junk then it talks about the risk of the dead satalites running into each other and last they talk about the little peaces of trash or junk as being a big deal because they could damage the space crafts that are up there
23930,9,0,chronological order
23931,9,0,the author organizes this article in a way that someone who know nothin about the topic of 'space junk' will be able to follow the text all the way through it is in other words arranged in order of increasing detail
23932,9,1,the author organizes this article in a very educational way that flows smoothly also it shows how things happen in a sequensual order this happens by telling what space junk is then afterwards finding out how its created and the dangers of said space junk
23933,9,1,the author makes various titles to catch ur eye by giving out some proof
23934,9,2,they organize the article into sections that are important and give explanation the sections sre 'what is space junk' 'crash coruse' and 'little bits but a big deal '
23935,9,1,the author wanted to get the point that send space equipment into space is not a good idea but he explains how all the space junk is cluttering up all of the space outside our earth and it is comeing down back to earth
23936,9,0,in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite
23937,9,1,the author organizes the article by events that have occured the author first tells about the two satellites that crashed leaving debris in space then the author goes on and tells about the lost tool bag in space and how the debris from that is dangerous for space travel
23938,9,0,he organizes it in a manner in which liitle problems turn into bigger problems in space
23939,9,2,the author organizes the article using an introduction two body sections and then a conclusion in the introduction the author describes what the article is about by stating in paragraph 3 'orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions ' the author gives excellent examples of how the 'space junk' came to be and explained how and why these pieces of debris are not good the author concludes by taking the article a step forward and showing that we can solve the problem of 'space junk'
23940,9,1,they start by describing what space junk is then what happens to objects sent to space after some time and at last they tell what the big deal is with space junk
23941,9,2,the autor organizes the article very well the introduction is very integuing pulling the reader in to find out what is the problem the author then goes into detail about how the junk actually entered the atmosphere the section titled 'crash course' posses the problems that are radiating out of all the space junk this includes the problem of satelights running into each other the author then ends the article explaining how little bits of undetectable debrees can harm space equiptment
23942,9,2,in this article the author organizes the paragraphs into an introduction mentioning space junk with humor a paragraph explaining what space junk is specific details about crashes that bring to light what could happen in the future a section describing the harmful effects of tiny debris and finally a paragraph that explains how the effects are increasing and how nations are working together to come up with a 'viable solution to space polllution ' this organization technique is common in information essays first the problem is introduced and from there the problem is discussed with background information statistics comparisons analogies and inferences for example the author uses the comparison of sand 'shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall' in the section that describes the harmful effects of small debris
23943,9,1,the author in the story organizes it in a very good way not only do they have an introduction body and conclusion but the story is intriguing and makes you want to read more the author also does a good job at the way she tells it
23944,9,0,allright
23945,9,0,this chapter was talking about space and this explan as how biga nd how much the nasa are having problems in the futere
23946,9,1,the author organizes this with first explaining what space junk is and then supporting details he tells of how space junk comes about and how dangerous it is when he told about the instruments they use to study and how that could become dangerous he was providing details as to what space junk is
23947,9,2,the author organize's the article by headlines before talking about the article for example the very first paragraph after the introduction has a headline that says what is space junk then it goes on to tell us about space junk after paragraph five it has the headline that says crash course and it goes on to talk about that and lastly after paragraph seven it has the head line that says little bits but a big deal and they go on to discribe that
23948,9,2,the author organizes the article in a very logical way he begins by using an introduction that will get the attention of the reader he follows this up by giving us a brief history of space junk next he describes the severity of this topic lastly he concluds by proposing a sollution to this problem
23949,9,0,he goes from an exciting first paragraph to two more detailed paragraphs
23950,9,0,they organize it by telling you some facts about space and space junk then they tell you the problem it causes
23951,9,0,he organized from the least amount of damage to what can cause the most amount
23952,9,2,the organization of the article is simple yet very effective for the reader to truly understand the concept of space junk in the beginning with the article called 'orbiting junk' the author creates an intresting lead in to draw in the reader after that paragraph the author proceeds in the body paragraph to tell the leader about space junk and the dangers that causes to other satellites i especially liked how the author organized the paragraph called 'little bits but a big deal ' i liked this because i had no idea that a tool bag would be such a treat if it was free floating in space i like how it discussed the damages it caused by using a metaphor about sand and the dangers it held through this organization of introduction body and conclusion the reader was able to understand how space junk is a serious matter
23953,9,1,the author organizes this article by separating it up into different sections with different titles
23954,9,2,the author organizes the article by having an interesting introduction that catches the reader's attention next the author explains the danger of the main topic mentioned in the introduction throughout the article until the conclusion the author says how dangerous and improtant the issues can be lastly the author explains how scientists are trying to fix the space junk problem
23955,9,1,the author starts off with an introduction being excited about seeing something in the sky in outer space the author then talks about something at the end of the paragraph and then writes another paragraph explaining what that means and how it came about the author also gievs out information on what has happened in outer space when it happened and how it harmed us
23956,9,1,the author starts out by explaining how the space junk got into the earth's orbit then he explains the dangers that a little piece could cause on a spaceship then he explains how much space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is on the rise
23957,9,2,the author organizes the article by putting it in sections that are related to eachother first the author explains what space junk is then describes the dangers of the junk and finally explains why the junk is a big deal
23958,9,1,the author organizes the article in order from how the objects get into space and then how they can crash into other things and cause many problems in space the author rights it in sequented order to define the issue from start to finish
23959,9,2,he organizes it into sections to explain space junk what has happened from space junk and why they are dangerous
23960,9,2,they list the sections in order of importance to begin after they have the reader's attention from their introduction they explain what exactly causes the problem that they will later define next they use the section 'crash course' to show that this isn't just a rare occurence that we will never really have to worry about but that it is a very problematic situation that we must prepare for finally they show that as satellites colide and are smashed into smaller bits they become even more dangerous because there is a higher chance of them colliding because of their great numbers
23961,9,2,he or she starts off by informing the reader what space junk is setting the tone making sure the reader understands what's going on first second he or she talks about the satellites crashing third he or she talks about no matter how small the debri is it can still do heavy damage when going five miles per second
23962,9,0,because its about space junk and how it could cause things to happen in our world
23963,9,0,he organizes it by bits of information
23964,9,0,the author organizes the article by explaining what the problem actually is discussing what its doing to the space and that we need to find a way to fix it
23965,9,2,by catching the readers attention then explaining what space junk is it then gives examples of the consequences of space junk and emphasizes the dangers
23966,9,2,the author organize the article by opening it with a brief introduction about 'space junk' then he explain more clearly about 'space junk' in the 'what is space junk' next is the evidence of the danger 'sapce junk' can make in 'crash course' finally in 'little bits but a big deal' the author points out how serious it is and 'space junk' need to be solved by the corporation of nations
23967,9,2,the author starts out by telling the reader about past space explorations and how long ago and when the space race began he also goes along and talks about how small debris in space can make a big inpact on the earth and the damage it can do to the earth and the people on it the author then goes along and talks about recent problems witht he debris in space and the two satellites crashing into eachother and the impact it had on the planet
23968,9,1,he creates sections of information about different topics he starts by telling the viewer about early launches of sattelites and telescopes and other things into space and works his way down to when they collide together and ends with the importance danger of little pieces of material in space
23969,9,1,the aurther organizes the article by keeping certian articles separated 'what is space junk' deals with the information of space junk like like information of what happens to all of bits and pieces lost in space as for others like obiting junk just deals with a small novel that gets the readers attention
23970,9,1,labals the titles
23971,9,1,the author organizes it so that is is like sections of a chapter in a textboook it is all focusing on the same all around topic but the sections are there to make it more specific
23972,9,2,the author organizes the article with little articles in it the first one grabs the attention of the reader and gives you an idea on what the article is going to e about the second one is to help the reader understand the history of space exploration and how long people on earth have been doing it the thrid one is all about satellites colliding together and creating space junk the last little article tells the reader how small but still very dangerous the space junk is
23973,9,0,he says that theres getting more and more things up in space and eventually things will crash
23974,9,0,they organize by the dates and years
23975,9,0,he starts out by asking a question then he tells us the reader the answer and explains it and what it is then paragraph by paragraph he gives more information about it nand explains more and more about it and also gets into better detail
23976,9,1,the author organizes this article by importance for example he or she talked about space junk crash course and then talked about little bits but a big deal
23977,9,0,i think that he or she organized the atricle to be interesting but at the same time informing the reader about what is going on with space junk and other problems it can have
23978,9,1,the author gives the problem first then the author gives details about it and some examples then the author explains why its important and what should be done
23979,9,1,the author has alot of good information about 'space junk' and he states that in every paragraph he states it by saying statisics about the size of junk the collisions and what may happen in the future
23980,9,1,it gives a background a story then a future cause for concern
23981,9,2,the author starts off by getting the readers attention in the introduction then the author explains what space junk is after that the author explains how it happens finally the author wraps it up by explaining what damage little pieces of debris can do to a spacecraft
23982,9,1,the author organizes the article in a way to inform the reader about the subject generally then becoming more specific the author starts off by describing what the subjest is 'what is space junk ' then the author goes on talking about satellites crashing and making space junk the author later goes on to explain the big deal of space junk in 'little bits but a big deal
23983,9,1,the author organizes this article by section of what happened in those time periods each section has information on the topic of the section some section of the story are about certain things so if your looking for something important you can look in the certain section were you think youe can find it
23984,9,1,the author organizes this article by an intro duction that is fun and gets the readers attention and he also uses information to back up his research that he thinks is right he also talks about them loosing a tool bag in space like this quote ' the lost tool bag for example is listed as satellite 33442' the lost tool bag is in the article for humor they are trying to come up witha solution to space pollution
23985,9,0,the author organizes this article in an order that tells you what they are talking about what it is and the problems it causes it is a very cause and effect type of order an example being how they first tell you what space junk is and then go on to tell you how it is dangerous to have the junk floating around in outer space because they run the risk of coliding with eachother
23986,9,2,the author first tells you what 'space junk' is then the author gives examples of how debri can be dangerous by telling you two stories about satillites crashing at the end of the article the author tell the harmful effects space trash can cause
23987,9,2,the author arganizes the artical by separating the information into sections that best fit the category that they belong to 'orbiting junk ' the title of the artical clarifies how space junk is a concern to government space agencies around the globe 'what is space junk ' defines and gives history to what the term means and how it came to be just as how it sounds in the heading of the section
23988,9,1,the author put it in different catagories like what is space junk and he talks bout what it is
23989,9,1,the author starts off by explaining what his story is about and its defining what space junk is he then tells how it is made and how big of a threat it causes for us and other satellites he then tells about the destructive force of a little peice of sand
23990,9,1,scientists are hard pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk
23991,9,0,they organized it by stating the problem saying what is causeing the problem and how it got there
23992,9,2,first the writer grabs your attention with the introduction then the writer tells you about the space trash in the section titled 'what is space junk ' next he talks about how the satellites in orbit now can get smaller due to the fact that they could run into each other causing more debry in the section titled 'crash course ' and finally thewriter tells us how the little objects floating around there now are a big deal and the more that the satellites break the more debry their will be in the future that section is title 'little bits but a big deal '
23993,9,1,he organized this article by putting the facts of satellite in order and telling the reader about each section which is talkin about the satellites
23994,9,1,he starts with a attention getter then goes to statistics and facts then he states the problem he talks about a solution then he said that these little things are a big problem he also said that the solution is difficalt to find
23995,9,1,the author of 'orbiting junk' organizes the article by opening with an introduction following with background information supporting information and ending with a conclusion
23996,9,2,the author organizes this article into four main parts 'orbiting junk' 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' 'little bits but a big deal '
23997,9,1,the author organizes the article by first explaining what space junk is then explanes the crash course of the satellites and debris after that it explains they are little bits but a big deal the author uses all of them combined to explain the importance of space debris and there effect on space travel
23998,9,2,the author organizes this article into smaller subtopics which explain different aspects of space junk each subtopic such as 'orbiting junk' and 'crash course ' highlights an individaul aspect of the problems caused by space junk while supporting the authors statement that space junk is a serious problem
23999,9,1,he or she starts out with how the space race started an how countries started sending satellites one afte another like with soviet union an the united states the goes with how when the satillites die the may run into anothe satellite an that may cause tons of debris and how its harmful to earth an space
24000,9,1,the author organizes the article by catching the reader's attention in the introduction then the author does a history of space junk then the next paragraph the author talks about crashing satellites the eight paragraph talks about little pieces of space junk and how they can be dangerous and in the last paragraph the author states that the problem is increasing and the worries of space agencies
24001,9,1,the author of 'orbiting junk' organizes the text in a cause and effect manner the author begins with the beginning of the space race which began to cause debris to be left in outer space he then procceds to other ways to create space junk such as colliding satalites he then demonstrates the problem posed by the orbiting garbage which causes individuals to begin searching for a solution since most of the authors major topics are caused by the one before the author arranged his or her piece in a cause and effect pattern
24002,9,2,the author organizes the articles in a way that will make it easiest for us to understand first he introduces us into what the whole piece will be about and gives us the main idea then he explains what makes the 'space junk ' next he gives an example of how the problem becomes more serious finally he gives a lot of facts that describe how big of a deal this really is
24003,9,2,the author begins the article with a kidding tone the introduction is not nearly as serious as the rest of the sections 'what is space junk' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' are all have a much more serious tone 'what is space junk' gives a background of space exprlorations and explains what space junk is it also foreshadows the potential problems of space junk by asking 'what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfunctions ' 'crash course describes how space junk came to be and different situations it involves such as colliding satellites 'little bits but a big deal describes other bad situations of space junk and the very serious problems they can cuase problems like 'disastrous holes'
24004,9,1,the author starts off with something interesting to get the readers attention then he expalined the reason for his opening statement after that he told us what space junk a little background history and simpla facts about it then he closes with why it matters why they little tiny space debris or junk matter because it is harmful
24005,9,2,they organize it by making up sections for example 'what is space junk' and 'crash course ' having sections makes it easier to find the information you're looking for
24006,9,1,the author starts out by joking about space junk after that the author gives facts about what happens to object in space and how it effects us and lastly the author explains how important it is and how it needs to change
24007,9,1,the author organized the article in a pattern the pattern they used was weaker reasons to more effective reasons through out the article and the use of transitions to put an emphasis on the importance of certian topics
24008,9,2,i believe that the author did a good job of organizing this article an example of good orginaziton is that he dosn't get side tract they used good headings like what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
24009,9,0,they talk about certain things and make them relate with other things when they need to everything is in perfect place and nothing is run together
24010,9,2,the author organizes the article by writing about different topics in a section for example in the article little bits but a big deal the author talks about how even the smallest fragments in space can be dangerous the author organizes this article very well and it's easier to understand
24011,9,1,the author first gives you information about things floating in space and how it can be harmful then the author gives you specific examples of incidents that have actually occured
24012,9,2,first it starts off how every good essay starts off with a good hook to bring readers into it next comes the beginning statement the sentence that tells the audiance what the writer is writing about and where they stand after that you have the body which in this case is made up of the history of space travel the information of how much and what makes up the debris and finally the impact it has on our space explorers after these statements comes the closure of the article giving all of the well rounded information that it is steadily increasing
24013,9,2,the author organizes this article by having a strong attention grabbing introduction and three main topics that support his opinion on the harm of space junk orbiting earth his conclusion paragraph states that there is an awareness of need for a solution to the three suggested issues but no solutions have been drawn by any nation thus far
24014,9,1,the author organizes in a way that tells us what space junk is from there the author clearly explains what happens with that junk and then goes on to tell us how harmful it can be for future exploration when we cannot prevent tiny bits of debris from damaging the space craft
24015,9,1,first the author introduces the topic in a light heearted fashion then as the article progresses the author talks about past events that are crutial to know in order to under stand what 'space junk ' is after that the author tells the reader more about satellites and how serious the debris orbitting in space is the author starts off less serious and finishes on a very serious note
24016,9,2,the author starts with an attention getter next the author explains the main topic and what exactly space junk is further more the author segways into the risks of dead satelites which he finished speaking about at the end of the first section lastly the final section is about how space debris is dangerous and how it's a topic that many care about and it's not a small matter
24017,9,1,the author makes subtitles that lets the reader know what the paragraph is about
24018,9,0,the author organizes it from big space junk to small space junk from satilleite to micro junk
24019,9,1,it starts off with a funny take on a realistic situation which goes into an article about space junk the article then goes on to tell about what space junk is and how it has been accumulating it tells of crashes between two satellites and how the debris of the satellites can cause a lot of damage to spacecrafts
24020,9,1,the author organizes this article in different sections so the reader can know what the section is about
24021,9,0,in multiple short answer and questions
24022,9,0,by telling you what it is where it came from and what size it comes in
24023,9,0,the author organizes the article by going in the order of importance and explaining why space exploration can be a danger and describing how dangerous it can be
24024,9,1,the author provides an intro definition explanation of how serious the problem is and a short paragraph to highlight efforts to help end the microdebris menace
24025,9,0,the author organized the article by geological events
24026,9,0,by understanding what countries put satelittes up above our earths atmosphere causing one to malfunction making the other do the same by them colliding
24027,9,2,the author goes from telling what space junk is then to satilites crashing and finally to little debris in space that can harm you
24028,9,1,the author does a good job of organizing information in this article the opening paragraph grabs your attention then we get more of a background on how serious space junk is the author tells us how it is formed and how dangerous it is at the end of the article the author tells us that these small pieces of junk pose a big threat
24029,9,1,he organizes it be sections
24030,9,0,the author organize the article in the yaer it happen the way
24031,9,0,the author organizws the articles by how he explains them each article is explained in great detail
24032,9,2,the author organizes the article by first introducing the problem at the beginning and then explaining the matter then the article goes on to talking about how the space trash and satellites can crash and creating dozens of pieces and debris then from the crash the article explains how the little microdebris can also cause a huge bad impact also
24033,9,1,he talks about people seeing space junk the n he talks about the history of space junk after that he talks about satellites and how they can crash into one another then he talks abotu microdebris feilds and how they can cause a huge problem
24034,9,1,the author first explains what space junk is then describes how it can be a problem
24035,9,0,the author organizes the article with facts facts that have statitics in them
24036,9,2,the author organizes the article by having an introduction that grabs the readers attention then they going on to explain what the topic of space junk is finally they going into different section of how space junk is dangerous
24037,9,1,he organizes it first with a little information on what he is going to be talking about and explaining then tells you what space junk is and gives you facts about that then what the collision of what space junk could do
24038,9,0,first the author trys to grab your attion then he she explains what the problem is after that he she gives some examples of what has happened over the years which makes up these problems
24039,9,0,it is a serious problem today with space debris disastrous holes in objects moving through space there are 33442 satellites
24040,9,2,the author organizes the article in to diffrent sections so that we can learn about diffrent things about how space debre is formed the articles names are ' what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal'
24041,9,0,the author organizes the peace of righting by being simply in the begining talking about the simplest way possible that the once clear space has been filled with junk orbiting the earth then he gets more intence giving facts and solar system problems with the atmospheric conditions
24042,9,1,the author organizes this article by dividing it into sections and explaining what the title means
24043,9,1,he is explaining the importance of the space junk and that we have polluted our atmosphere with junk the earth will be in serious danger if the space junk keeps collecting
24044,9,1,the author organizes the article into logically divided sections there is an introduction an explanation an example and then a section where the author sums up his point these sections enable the reader to understand the problem of 'space junk' as they read the article
24045,9,2,the article talks about how the space junk got in to orbit 'over the past 52 years' then it talks about how it can be dangerous to us also how the tinest particles can cause damage
24046,9,1,the author organizes the article by first telling the reader what 'space junk' is then the author gives examplesof what 'space junk' can do in paragraphs 6 and 7 the author then goes on to tell the reader about how many people are concerned about the microdebris floating in space
24047,9,1,the author organizes the article by seperating the problems into their own section of the article the titles are in order how the debris happen
24048,9,2,the author organizes this article by grouping together similar topics and titling them in order of describing space junk to the solution of space junk it starts with 'what is space junk ' and ends with 'little bits but a big deal'
24049,9,2,the author organizes the article by heading each section with a title for example what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal then in each section the author gives details about the topic of the section given away in the titles this makes understanding the information easier
24050,9,0,the author organize the article by put the less importan to the most importan and then he puts the most importan like how many miles per hour and what had happened in the past year
24051,9,2,the author organizes the article by using the classic topical structure there is the introduction followed by the three subtitles 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' the author then supports the subtopics by details put in two to four paragraphs
24052,9,2,the author puts all the main points as his title in the article it says what is space junk then it has all of the information about space junk underneath it
24053,9,1,the author trying getting you into the story in the introduction and get you to follow it all the way through h etalkes about what is space junk and all the crash courses and all te little bits but a big deal stuff that goes on in space
24054,9,2,it tells you what space junk is the soviet union launched the first satellite then united states followed crash course what happens when the satellite die in space little bits but a big deal that some people care but other just don t now about what going on in space
24055,9,0,the author tells us how satellites and get into space and how they dont work anymore then what happens
24056,9,0,the author gives you details like over the past 52 years a variety of spacecrafts have been sent beyond earth's atmosphere not all of the satellites can still work because of all the junk that is foalting around most of the satellites have actually had problems and came back to earth
24057,9,1,this article is separated into sections or chapters each new chapter has a title the entire chapter sticks to the point this article is organized as if it was a book
24058,9,2,he organizes it by sections by 3 different parts one is 'what is space junk' 'crash crouse' and 'little bits but a big deal'
24059,9,1,intro beginning middle end first by using shocking statements to grab your attention then once the reader has your attention he she provides you which researched information and the hard facts after providing the facts he she explains the various problems space junk can create lastly he she leaves you with a few things to think about
24060,9,2,the author of this article organizes it in a very intelligent way first the author begins with an introduction that captures the attention of the reader other than the beginning title the author also includes subtitles or headings the author uses three different headings to divide the different pieces of information into the same categories the subtitles are organized in a way that helps grow on the seriousness of 'space junk ' this can simply be seen through the subtitles themselves what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
24061,9,1,the article is organized under different headings and the headings are explained also the years of different facts go in chronological order
24062,9,1,the author starts out with surprising statements to alarm the reader and to make them attentive the author also has the titles of each section titled appropriately and accuratly to help us understand the seriousness of trash in space we take space for granted most of the time and we have no idea of the dangers of the junk up there that can actually do harm to earth itself
24063,9,2,the author organizes the article by starting off with the question' 'what is space junk ' in the two paragraphs the author explains about history of going into space then there is another title 'crash course' those two paragraphs explain satellites crashing into each other then there is another titled' 'little bits but a big deal ' those three paragraphs explain the floating lost things in space
24064,9,2,the author organized the article 'orbiting junk' by adding different sections of reading in saying sections i am referring to the titles through out the article 'what is space junk ''crash course' 'little bits but a big deal'those titles are all examples of how the author organized his article
24065,9,2,the author organizes this article in a simple yet effective way they have chosen one main point which is space junk and created a few subtopics by doing this they have made it simple to stay on topic and still learn about different aspects of the problem the article begins by telling the audience what problem they are going to elaborate on which is orbiting junk next they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves what is space junk well after reading the second paragraph we know what that is after this we are educated on risks of crashes and collisions with the junk that is orbiting in our solar system last of all we read that no matter how small the object is it can have a large impact on other objects in the atmosphere because these smaller topics are separated from each other the reader can maintain their attention while reading of the many different factors of space junk
24066,9,1,the author writes this article so that the term 'space junk' is explained in the beginning the process of the object becoming a space junk is explained in the beginning followed by the dangers that occur because of it this article is organized so that the reader is informed about space debris little by little after being informed on how the 'dead' object can cause harm the reader then learns about why space pollution is becoming a major problem the way this article is organized helps the readers be informed on space pollution without recieving too many information at once the article is divided into sections then paragraphs allowing the reader to understand more easily the information that is being given to them
24067,9,2,he organizes the article by titling things in sections like 'what is space junk' and only talks about what is needed in that section and 'crash course' is another way the author broke up the article
24068,9,2,he oragnizes the article by catching the reader's attetion before explaining the serious issues of space junk he then explains what space junk is so we understand what he is talking about later on the article better after he explains what space junk is he talks about the history of us invading space and how stuff gets left behind then he explains how space junk is a serious matter to earth and the people heading to space
24069,9,2,the author starts out explaining what space junk is and how it got up in space then they talk about the dangers of it being in space and the impact of the space junk collisions 'both satellites traveling at more than 20 000 mph crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth' then they go into why this is all a big deal to us and the world
24070,9,0,he organizes through chronilogical order
24071,9,1,the author organized the article with different headings and sections
24072,9,1,the author starts out as if it's going to be a good story then the author goes into how dangrous the 'orbiting junk' can be under ' what is space junk' they tell you 'over the past 52 years a variety of spacecrafts' have been launched into space in ' crash course' the author tells you ' with no controls dead satellites ru n the riskk of colliding with eachother' last but not least in ' little bits but a big deal' the author tells you that 'scientists are hard pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk'
24073,9,2,the auther puts the article together in different sections first there is the hook and intro then there is some background info and then the statistics and current matters on this subject
24074,9,0,he organizes it on how much the reader will learn and how much the reader will read and comprend he doesn't want his reader getting bored after the first paragraph
24075,9,1,the author organizes the article by talking about a certain subject but then hinting to another subject this hint gives the reader a sense of knowing what is coming up for instance in the introduction she mentions space junk but then she moves into another paragraph explaining what it is at the end of that paragraph she mentions it 'circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit' this led into the 'crash course' paragraph and so on
24076,9,0,it is organized by how it happens in chronological order the satellites would have to crash before they would have junk fall off of them
24077,9,2,in this selection the author organizes his her main points into sections that relate and flow from one to the other for example he she use the transition form the main title 'orbiting junk ' to 'what is space junk ' these sections describe what 'space junk' is then he she transition into the dangfers of 'space junck ' by using titles such as 'crash course ' which transitions into 'little bits but a big deal ' these sections demenstrate the dangers of colliding sattilites the author organized his her selection in a way that flows from one point to the next
24078,9,2,the author begins the article with an attention grabber in order to make the reader interested in the topic giving the reader a little information regarding space junk the author clarifies the topic and gives details in the second section 'what is space junk ' describing the main topic to the reader gives the author an opportunity to discuss the problems with this increasing volume of junk the author ends the passage by describing the dangers of these pieces of debris stating that the objects in space are similar to ' sand shot from a sandblaster ' the author concludes his passage with a tone of resolution he hopes that solutions can be created to stop this growing problem
24079,9,2,they talk about the defintion of space junk that is in our outer space they give an example about when the soviet union launched the first satellite inter outerspace then in goes on and talks about the crash course which is when the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with other objects floating in space the problem is it can only see about the size of a baseball and their are smaller things floating around in space that can crash into the satelite that hurts the satalite because the objects are going at least five miles in space the space shuttle isn't moving that fast and is very delicate the amount of space trash is increasing because the commercial space travel is up because more nations have taken space explorations they are hopiong to come up with a solution to stop this pollution in space
24080,9,1,the author divides each different part about orbiting junk into their own sections the author doesn't fuse his or work together
24081,9,1,the author first draws the readers in by using an attention grabber then the author gives the reader some history about space then he processes on telling the reader about the harmful risks that are accurring in space
24082,9,1,first the author started talking about the basic information about the space junk and then he wrote what it is use for and also talked abour all rhe dangerous and safety thins about the space junk
24083,9,2,the author organizes the article in catagories as to help the reader understand the article better the article starts out with definition 'what is space junk ' goes to how some space junk is created 'crash course' and then goes to why space debris is a big deal in 'little bits but a big deal'
24084,9,2,the author organizes this article by true facts he first talks about the history and how satellites first started out in space then he goes into if the collide what would happen and how it would be harmful to space he lets you know how some of the satellites travel how fast they move per second he lets you know that when they do collide harmful things can come from it he organized it so that after you something benefitial he urges that something bad can also come from something good
24085,9,2,the author organizes the article by having headings for different topics this makes it easier for the reader to follow and stay on topic the author begins the article with a common phrase 'it's a bird it's a plane it's superman ' but with a unique spin the author then presents a heading 'what is space junk' to show that the fun friendly introduction is complete and the serious article is begninning from there the author uses a new heading ie crash course little bits but a big deal to show when he is about to begin a new topic
24086,9,1,he starts out with a more general topic then he gets into more specific topics like space junk then he goes on to say crash course and gives a example how a american space craft and a russian craft carshed then the auther talks about the debris in the orbit around the earth
24087,9,2,the author orgaizes the article in different sections by explaining the different aspects of space junk such as the categories of orbiting junk what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
24088,9,1,the author of this article organizes it into four different sections the author introduces a problem gives the history of this problem tells you how it occurs the finally tells you why it matters
24089,9,0,the author organizes this article into the past the current and our future lives the author organizes this article in a way that the atomosphere seems crucial to our planet
24090,9,1,the author organizes the artice in a simple way the author grabs the attention of the reader first the author does this by a comical statement then the author goes into how serious of a problem it is right when he grabbed your attention he gives you simple facts from history and just flat out tells you things so that you don't have to read between the lines he tells you the basics and then sums it up by saying how important and dangerous space trash is and leaves you to think with that
24091,9,1,the author begins by giving backround information explaining how common space junk is formed then leads into how tiny bits of space junk are formed and finally how these small debris are a big problem
24092,9,0,the author organizes the article by putting it in order of what is space junk to why it effects us in the article it mostly states all of the problems people have had going into space their problem all talk about getting hit or crashing into something floating in space
24093,9,2,the author started off by telling us what space junk is then went into the different catergories 'what is space junk' is the title for the first couple of paragraphs
24094,9,2,the interduction gets your attion to read the artical and tells you what its going to be about what is space junk gives more information on the objects in our atmosphere and what they are doing there crash course tells a story about how some space junk gets in the atmospher and the last paragraph tell how all this is really a big deal and something should be done about it
24095,9,2,they break it into sections which allows the reading to get a better understaning for example in the introduction 'grab your telescope ' allows the reader to jump on bord in a sence in the what is space junk section 'in 1957 the soviet union lunched the first artificial satellite ' this give the reader facts and ideas of what is going on in crash course 'with no one at the controls dead satellites run the risk of colliding wih each other ' this shows risks and what could happen little bits but a big deal 'those bits of space debris present a very serious problem ' shows why we should be worried
24096,9,0,the aticle goes from attention getting to informational then it is jus importance of space junk
24097,9,1,the author orginizes the article by putting things together for example 'crash course' has information about satellies and other things that crash into other things they put like information together so its easier to go through and find things
24098,9,1,it starts with an introduction then it gives subheadings with facts about the subheading
24099,9,2,the author organizes the artical into groups he explans all of the groops what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal e explanse what will happen or what could happen in space if something runs into each other or if an astronaut droped something wile working
24100,9,2,he organizes it by making the introduction telling you that space junk might just fall on you then he tells you what space junk is basically after that he tells you how they collide and form into microdebris and how they might crash onto earth little bits but a big deal shows you that some people might not really care about those tiny forms of debris but you actually should if they go at a very fast speed
24101,9,2,he organizes the article from history to crashes tothe problems that concern micro debris and what is being done to stop it
24102,9,0,by telling facts about satellites in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite
24103,9,2,the author first starts out with the introduction which explains what it is about the next paragraph is 'what is space junk' which is telling us what space junk is which is the cause for all the debri and junk in space the next paragraph is called 'crash course' which tells us what the space junk has caused in space the last section is 'little bits but a big deal and it tells how people feel about the junk and what is going to happen to it all
24104,9,0,the author organizes this artical of how these project help the earth but can also harm the earth
24105,9,1,like the way he starts it of gets you in it then he start to describe them in sections and certain parts to make the article good and didn't stick on one sublect but speard it out and also had facts in the article some of the things they do when they are in space and the oblects they use
24106,9,1,from talking about what is space junk then the author talks about the most serious concepts of what space junk can do to spacecrafts in orbit
24107,9,2,the author organizes the article with specific titles for each section for instance one of the titles is called 'crash course ' this section of the article explains how satelites and other debris floating in space can potentially collide and screw up satelites with will affect global communication
24108,9,1,the author organizes this article by beginning with an introduction leading into 3 main paragraphs and ending with a conclusion
24109,9,1,he breaks the topics into differnt sections so they can be read and understood more clearly

24111,9,0,he organizes it by detail
24112,9,1,the author starts with a great attention getter that is a concerning statement then he goes into the history of when the human race first did something with space the russians launch a satellite then the auther goes into how debris can get into the orbit by telling us that satellites do crash into eachother then he goes into how these little peices of deebris are a big deal because they can be caught and pulled down to the earth at enormous speeds
24113,9,1,by putting them in order and using titles of his story to catch yur eye and make u want to read how inportant it is
24114,9,1,the author organizes this article by putting headings at the top of the page and keeps adding new ones when he changes subjects it lets you know the good about space junk and the bad about space junk then it goes into the sizes of stuff how even the little pice of sand is a big deal and could really hurt your space craft
24115,9,2,the author organizes the article into sections that explain what it is what is couses and how we are affected each section is wsell informed and organized such as the two satellites colliding in the section titled crash course
24116,9,2,the author organizes the article with an introduction and three body paragraphs paragraph one gives a brief history of the 'great space invasion' and poses the question of what happens to the damaged satellites telescopes and space capsules that cannot be repaired paragraph two begins with what may happen if two unmanned satellites were to collide in space resulting in hundreds of 'microsatellites' finally paragraph three expresses the seriousness of the matter stating that at extreme speeds small objects can create huge wholes and damgae other space equpiment a solution is difficult but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space it also emphasizes the growing number of satellites capsules telescopes etc being sent into space and how therefore space trash is increasing
24117,9,1,this author organizes the article first with an introduction to grab the reader's attention the introduction introduces us to what the rest of the paper is going to be about the author then is able to explain exactly what the paper is about with 'what is space junk ' he then gives us an example of what is going on with the problem and then why it is important and what is being done to help it
24118,9,2,the author starts out the article with an introduction the will grab the readers attention and make them keep reading he also catorgorises each section with a title like 'what is space junk' 'crash course' and 'little bits but big deal' to let the reader know what each paragraph is about the author insures the reader by using true information instead of his or hers own openions
24119,9,2,the author organizes the article by first grabbing the readers attention then describing what space junk really is then how space junk is formed and lastly why we should care about it and what we can do to reduce space junk
24120,9,0,the author used organized paragraphs
24121,9,1,the author organizes the article into groups
24122,9,1,the author organizes the articles by splitting them up into different sections and they all have different titles on what the paragraph is about
24123,9,2,the author orgnize the article by putting everything in its own section of the article for example in the first paragraph the author puts a part about space junk then in the second paragraph he talks about what space junk is and how it comes to be at the end of the article he says how space junk is becoming a really big problem for everyone that is how he organizes the article
24124,9,2,they organize it into subject matter 'what is space junk ' 'crash cource' and 'little bits bit a big deal ' they also try to catch the readers attention with the titles of the sections
24125,9,1,the author organizes this article in a interesting format for example he introduces us with dialouge between two people then he changes his tone into a serious matter and explains what he is going to talk about also he divides his paragraphs into topics so we know what the next paragraph is about this shows that he is very organized and wants to keep us organized as well while we are reading it
24126,9,1,the author organizes the article about aspects of space exploration in a specific way the author first gives the reader an attention grabber in the introduction then the author informs the reader about a brief history about space exploration and space 'junk' from there the author talks about satellites and how space junk can be harmful to the surface of the earth
24127,9,1,the author organizes the story by first explaining where and when the space junk first started and where it came frm then the story later explains how these little problems can became a very serious matter
24128,9,0,grab your telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor
24129,9,1,the author put this articke in different collums and explains what each of the headings mean
24130,9,2,he starts off by giving information on the history of satellites then goes into detail on how satellites can collide with eachother that is when he then explains why space trash is bad
24131,9,1,in this article the author does a great job at organizing all of his information i think that it was good that the author had a main title and an introduction that explained all that he or she was going to talk about and then the author had subtitles when they were going on a new topic i know that when the questions came up it was very easy for me to find the answers because the subtitles organized it very well
24132,9,1,the author shows good organizational skills with the way he or she wrote the article he or she started out with suspence then went into some history then ended with a warning about the dangers of space junk
24133,9,2,the first part of the artice he uses the word space junk then in paragrphs 4 and 5 he explains what it is and how they circle the earth in there own orbit in paragraphs 6 and 7he talks about what happens if two of the satelites collide together then it forms tiny peice of material that cant be seen from earth also in the last paragraph he tells how the tiny peices of debris still plays a big part in space
24134,9,2,the author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction and three sub topics i agree that 'space junk' could become a big problem i feel this way because the qoute 'if you find that hard to believe compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall ' that qoute shows that even small subtances can cause a lot of harm if it has enough force and something falling back to earth from space would have a ton of force
24135,9,2,the author organizes the article by giving information about space junk then talking about dead satellites and there risk of colliding with each other the ending talks about how these small peices of spacejunk are actually a dangerous problem there are even titles to go along with the clasifications including what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
24136,9,1,the author organize the article in a way that allows the reader to easily comprehend what the paragraph is describing by telling what each topic pertaines to it also allow the reader to go back and review a certian section quickly
24137,9,2,the author organizes the article into four major groups the introduction 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal'
24138,9,1,the author starts back in the day when space came to the attentions of the u s and the u s s r and how over the years things have progressed and how we have left jusk in outer space that could mean a threat to us at some point
24139,9,1,the author organizes his articles by bolding the new topic paragraphs he makes it stick out and be readable for the reader to catch the eye or attention of the reader and it informs the reader that he is switching topics within the story
24140,9,2,the author organizes this article by putting it into four main sections the first section is just the opening that catches one's attention the second section is explaining what the space just is without this section one may be confused as to what the author is talking about the third section is about times when objects in space have collided and made lots of debris that is still floating around today finally the last section is talking about how even though there are just tiny bits of debris it is still very dangerous this is a very good way for the author to present their information
24141,9,1,the article is in catagories of what happens
24142,9,1,the auother organizes this article by first wexplaing what space junk is thengiving examples of how its a proble then how its such a big deal
24143,9,1,they organize thisw artical by putting main headings and under heading the talk about the subject that the heading is referring to then they chosse many diffrent topics and do the same thing for alll the other topics and the write about the topic
24144,9,0,the author organize the article by showing the most importants ideas around the article also in the begiining of the article he started with an catching idea so therefore he basically know where he was going to put it in
24145,9,0,he put the important pats first
24146,9,1,the author organize the article he says in the frist article what is space junk in 1957 the soviet union launhed the frist artificial satellite the author organize the article evey well
24147,9,2,the author starts with 'orbiting junk' and 'what is space junk' to describe exactly what space junk is and what it is caused by the author then follows with 'crash course' and uses this section to explain what the problems are that space junk can cause finally the author ends with 'little bits but a big deal' and describes what can be done to prevent the problems that space junk causes and what space centers are doing to help the cause
24148,9,2,the author organizes the article into multiple sections divided by headings the author does this to help the reader get a better understanding about what he she is learning about first you learn about the history of space travel then you are given information on a real collision that occured a couple of years ago following this the information is then put into perspective by talking about a sandblaster finally the call to action takes place to conclude this article
24149,9,2,the author organizes the article by first explaining the origins of the microdebris that litters the solar system then going into explaining the harmful problem that this debris is creating for the earth's surface
24150,9,2,the author organizes this article into diffrent categories in the categorie called 'what is space junk ' it goes to describe the diffrent types of debris and how they become lost on our atmosphere in the article called 'crash course' it describes two satelite crashes that happened in 2009 and 2008
24151,9,1,it is organized in different sections to make it easier to understand
24152,9,2,the author organized this article very well after introducing the piece he went straight to informing educating his readers about how space junk came to exist he then moves on to tell the readers about how satellites can be great contributors to space junk followed by the importance of awarness and concerns of space junk he informs his readers how the various pieces of junk can be harmful to machinery that scientists send into space but alo how the damage from the collisions of space junk to said machines is unavoidable the author then ties up the peice with how space agencies are hoping to work with other coroporations and even nations to come up with a solution to the 'space pollution'
24153,9,1,the author seperates it into sections and in eaach section he she puts some very interesting facts in there for the reader
24154,9,1,he first draws in the readers attention then informs them of what space junk is third he informs them of how space junk is caused fourth he informs the reader of how even the space junk pieces may be small they can also be very dangerous
24155,9,1,he starts out with a introduction next he defines what the problem is after that he tells the reader why its a problem the last paragraph is his conclusion and why it needs to be stopped
24156,9,2,the author organizes the article by first giving a story in the introduction along with a paragraph about orbital pathways and space junk then he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph the ending paragraph in that section talking about dead satellites circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit leads to the next main point crash course that talks about the american and russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path also it says that accidents do happen and gives an example on an astronaut loosing grip of a tool bag while doing repairs on the international space station this leads into little bits but a big deal in this paragraph it says so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash this leads into the subject that many people do infact care it then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion
24157,9,1,the author organized this article in a very neat way by dividing the categories up into iindividual sections it is very easy to read it's rather refreshing
24158,9,1,the author describes how space junk is prodused and what causes it to become small bits of space junk the artical starts with satellites and works his way down to what microdebris is made of
24159,9,0,he get information and tells it how it is bad and dangers to the world and in space
24160,9,2,he organize his article in the way he is talking about what is space junk in one seccion crash course in other seccion and little bits but a big deal in other seccion so we can understand better because everything is not together
24161,9,1,the author talks about different space topics ever part of the artcle have it's own topic an whats it's about like the different parts of the article
24162,9,2,this article is organized with a fairly common format first is a small shocking anecdote which serves to grab the attention of the reader then are a few sections highlighting the necessary details the reader needs to know to fully understand the problem such as an explanation of how space junk comes to be and how space junk is so dangerous these are followed by a conclusion paragraph highlighting the most important information to help the message sink in one last time
24163,9,2,the author organizes this article from begining to end the author starts with simple factas and attention getters then makes the way down towards the imoportant facts the author has three major facts and he supports them with detail and then give their overall veiw of their oppion on the article
24164,9,2,the author organizes this article by first catching the reader's attention with lines 1 and 2 in the introduction with an unbelievable statement that seems false next the author wants to tell you about the history of sattelites and other objects we have sent in to space and how they are still orbiting this earth this lets the reader know there is a ton of waste in our atmosphere crash course and little bits but a big deal tell us how dangerous all of these large and small bits are to astronauts and sattelites at the end of the last paragraph the author concludes that scientists are trying to find a way to clear or avoid these bits of matter therefore that is how the author organizes this article
24165,9,2,the author organizes this article by having headings the heading 'what is space junk' lets you know this passage will be about space junk and what it is each heading helps the reader know exactly what they will be reading about this is a good way of keeping an article organized
24166,9,1,the author first starts out by explaining how space junk got there and the growing knowledge we have of space and its history then he explains how and why satellites are colliding with eachother in every paragraph there is a different explanation of the effects of space junk and debris
24167,9,1,sections
24168,9,0,space travel from 1957 union launched the first space satellite to go to the moon
24169,9,1,the authot begins by catching the reader's attention with several shocking statements once the reader has learned the subject of the article the reader then goes on to explain a simplified history of the subject of space debris after explaining how so many satellites have been put into orbit by multiple nations the author gives a few examples of colisions that have occured in the recent past followed by the damage that can be caused from these crashes the author concludes by highlighting the importance of the subject refering to examples previously stated in the article such as that concerning the lost tool bag
24170,9,0,he organizes like from harmless to harmful saying that it is getting worse and worse over time
24171,9,0,the author starts with shocking statements to grab the readers attention the author then follows by defining the meaning of the articles topic the author uses facts and statistics to suppport his opinion on the dangers of space junk
24172,9,2,the author first uses a funny statement then uses a more serious passage about the begining of satelites then to how these satilites can sometimes crash causing debri to scatter then finally how these little peices of debri can become lethal
24173,9,2,the author of 'orbiting junk' effectively organizes his piece to inform the reader of the dangers of space trash he begins with an introduction and gives the reader interest along with the basic background needed to understand the purpose of the article the author then moves into the section of 'what is space junk ' where he proceeds to the story of the great space invasion he tells the reader of the many satellites within our atmosphere from this race and introduces the idea of the satellite malfunctioning and creating 'space junk ' in 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' the author uses strong language unknown problems with space junk and a real life example to convince the reader of how harmful space junk is to the human race he ends with a conclusive paragraph that the dangers of space junk are actually increasing leaving with the small hope that there is a solution in the works to stop the space pollution
24174,9,2,the author organizes this article so that it is easy for the reader to understand the author starts by explaining what the problem is in the section 'what is space junk ' he then explains in 'crash course' what happens and then in the last section 'little bits but a big deal' the author explains to the reader why this problem is such a big deal
24175,9,2,the author starts out with a humorous exploration of a toolbag which is later explained the tone is switched to a more serious one and talks about how the space junk is dangerous the author brings in some history which is needed to explain a few things afterwards the article tells how the microdebris can destroy things launched into space and gives an analogy to give a picture then ends with how the pollution in space is increasing and how it is a huge problem
24176,9,1,the author organized the article by havinf four different things about space and naming each paragraph with a different title
24177,9,0,from year to year
24178,9,1,the author starts off with questions and then he goes on to talk about things and objects that are out in space next he is talking about collisions and more then even though some things are small that they can still cause a great deal of damage
24179,9,2,he explains what he is talking about by saying he sees some space junk in the sky next he explains what it is and gives some background information on it then he explains how it causes satellites to collide into each other objects in space are considered orbiting satellites which is dangerous for astronauts finally he explaines exactly how it is dangerous and what he can do
24180,9,2,the author organize the article by what is space junk in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite the next section is about crash course with no one at the controls dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other the last section is about little bits but a big deal actually many people do those bits of space debris present a very serious problem
24181,9,0,he organizes it by 'spac junk'
24182,9,1,he starts by creating an introduction which explains the problem in the next paragraph he tells the reader how the problem got there then in the third paragraph he tells you what happened the final paragraph explains the danger ther problem has caused
24183,9,0,he organizes this article in finding the problem providing a reason for that problem and then he demonstraits how people are trying to fix this problem
24184,9,0,orbiting junk over the 52 years he a variety of spacecrft includ space capsules telescope and satelites
24185,9,2,the author organizes the article by headlines he uses the headlines 'what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal' to seperate information
24186,9,2,the author organizes the article by using headings the different headings talk about some of the topics that have to do with space junk under the section titled 'what is space junk ' the author explains how the engines used to power spaceships are disintegrated under 'crash course' the author explains how sattelites colide into eachother finally the in 'little bits but big deals' the author explains how the little things that are inspace can potentially cause great problems
24187,9,2,first the author starts out very enthusiastic and wanting to actually tell you about the topic he wants to express the author uses a very catchy introduction and it really got me hooked from the first time i read it then he gets serious and starts telling about how 'space junk' is really a harmfull thing and we are under estimating what it can do then he starts talking about crash course which tells you how people cant control dead satellites but they are still a major threat
24188,9,2,the author breaks the article up into four parts orbiting junk what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
24189,9,0,to help the readers understand whats going on around them
24190,9,1,the author broke the article up into parts in order by explaining what one matter was about and then moving along to the next growing more and more in depth with each passage
24191,9,0,well the author says space junk can become bad and sometimes end up really goood but on the other hand space can always mean damage to other thing that our out in space
24192,9,1,their have been lots of sattilest launched into space in the last 52 years most of them are orbiting the earth over time the sateillite breaks apart due to the lack of maintness
24193,9,2,the author first begins with an introduction to what the article will be about they then move on to overviewing what 'space junk' consists of and how it came to be after that they deliver information about satellites crashing into one another and how that forms debris that orbits around our earth finally they discuss how big of an impact this debris can have on our atmosphere and earth's surface
24194,9,1,he divides the article into smaller subarticles so it is easier to organize what information goes where he has headlines that tell you what he is going to talk about before he begins
24195,9,0,the author organizes this article by problems to how it effects our planets and solar systems this is shown by the 9 through 11th paragragh
24196,9,2,the author organizes the article by explaining what the article is about and then telling how dangerous it can be even if it is only a small piece 'what is space junk ' tells about what it is and how long it has been up there and when they figured out what it was the section 'crash course ' tells about how the little particles in space can damage the satellites even if they are small pieces the last section 'little bits but a big deal ' tells about what the fragments can do to a satellite it also tells how the spacecraft is designed to try to avoid the little particles but sometimes can not avoid them all this article explains what 'space junk' is and how it affects the satellites it also explains how much damage something so little can do
24197,9,1,the author puts the information in sections and titles them so that the reader can better underdstand the importance of what he is trying to get across
24198,9,2,the author organizes the article by putting a title on each different matter that they are addressing 'what is space junk ' describes what it is they are talking about and informing the reader 'crash course' is all about collisions with satellites and other space junk that is orbiting the earth last but not least 'little bits but a big deal' states various instintances where tiny debris can harm the biggest of objects due to the speed that it is traveling and the dangers of having space junk the author let's the reader know what each part will be about
24199,9,1,by labeling what section of the story and what it is going to be about and he keeps it too were he dont jump off of the topic or anything
24200,9,2,the author organizes the article by first introducing the topic and that it poses a threat the author then goes on to give background information about how alot of the debris gets into orbit in the next section section the author describes what happens to the debris when it is outer space and how it can pose major problems finally the author explains the threat of the debris to humans and what is being done to counteract the space pollution
24201,9,1,the author starts out with his thesis statement paragragh then sums everything that he or she wanted us to know in his supporting paragraphs lastly he gave us an introduction and some final facts in the end of his article
24202,9,0,he organizes the article by putting the educational facts in one paragraph and the interesting facts in another he separates all the different things and tells you about them induvidually
24203,9,1,in this article the author organizes the story by arranging it in a good way and not using too much facts starting with descirbing the space debris at the begining was very good because it allowed the reader to know what it is and how it is created also i liked how he ended by putting in a lot of facts and telling us that we are working hard to get rid of the space debris
24204,9,1,the author organizes the article by putting the main topics in seperate paragraphs and explains them throughly each topic is explained and has lots of information about them theres diffferent information in the text but its all refers to orbiting junk
24205,9,2,the author organizes the article in small sections with only a few paragraphs to explain the subtopic in each section the subtopic what is space junk consists of two paragraphs it is all under the main topic orbiting junk
24206,9,1,they organize it in sections explaining space junk and how it all got there they also give history behind it all
24207,9,1,the author organizes this article to put in different important information they also do this so people will not get so confused when they are reading the author also put in the different sections so if you want to read the diiferent parts in a defferent order that they come in the author organizes the article so it has chapters when you read the article it is easier for someone to remember where or what they were reading about
24208,9,0,the auther writes this artical as if he were writing a newsletter
24209,9,2,the author separates the article in 4 different categories the order of the article is the introduction explaining what space junk is explaining what happens in space with the space junk and lastely explaining the dangers of space junk
24210,9,2,the author organizes this article by starting out with a general idea then focusing into details of that idea as you continue on in the section in the introduction the idea of space junk is first introduced in a catchy way next in the first section space junk is defined for the reader and it is explained why space junk is in space then in the next section crash course some problems with space junk are introduced as well as some more details finally in the last section the idea that space junk can be problematic is introduced supporting details are added to the section and then the author wraps up the article the author has organized this article by starting with a general topic of space junk then adding more detail and ideas to that topic as the article continues
24211,9,2,the author starts off by giving background information about junk that orbits in the 'orbiting junk' headline the author then proceeds to give the reader background information on space junk in the 'what is space junk ' headline the author then goes on to talk about spack junk and its path and possible collision course after that the author shows how little pieces of junk can have a huge and costly impact on the space inviornment the passage is written like an essay with an introduction body and a conclusion
24212,9,1,he orgainizes it in many different paragraphs to maybe break down each sudject like he put it in different titles to tell you just the main things about that topic and maybe if its broke down you will understand it more
24213,9,0,the author organize this article form what he now about space and finds information on space the information he finds is that the soviet union had launched the first satellite in space than years later the united states launched there first satellite
24214,9,0,in smaller articles to get the most detail in with the smallest amount of work possible in the most understandable way
24215,9,0,the author organizes the article in a way that allows the reader to understand what is happening most readers do not know what 'space junk' is and the author uses their organization skills to tell the readers how the junk came to be and how dangerous 'space junk' can be
24216,9,1,the author organizes this article in different sections he first starts off with an intro he then has a paragraph about the history of space junk and satellites finally he talks about the importants of dead satellites and small space junk
24217,9,2,the author starts out by telling the reader that a tool bag is floating in space the next section entitled 'what is space junk ' explains how disabled satellites can become junk orbiting the earth the next section entitled 'crash course' explains how satellites can collide with each other and create many more dangerous free orbiting satellites the final section entitled 'little bits but a big deal' expalins how the smallest space junk can create problems such as damage to space craft
24218,9,2,the author put titles about pargraphs that descibe something about space junk the begining of each new section tells you facts about debris or history that gets you interested on reading more what is space junk tells you about how junk got there in the first place talking about the first launch and the space race in the cold war crash course tells you about some of the recent collisions among satelites and what people have left behind little bits but a big deal talks about how even the smallest items can damaged a space craft it also tells about how it is increasing and becoming more of a problem
24219,9,1,the author organizes the article by using a title for each paragraph telling the reader what each section is about
24220,9,0,he explains all the stuff in space and all the things that could happen
24221,9,2,the author organizes the article in discriptive paragraphs the subtitle 'what is space junk' describes the history of space travel and how space junk is created the subtitle 'crash course' provides a specific example of space debris being created the subtitle 'little bits but a big deal' describes the harmful effects of space junk
24222,9,1,like starting off on asking what is all the junk in are space second off crash course they are meaning that are ssatellites are colliding into each other third they put little bits but a big dearl they mean that there anly little pieces of rubbel that is coming back down to are earths surface but there could possible bigger pieces later on that could come back down at us
24223,9,1,the author organizes the article by first starting out with an explanation of spacecrafts first going into space then the author talks about the satellites and when they're broken how much of an impact they have on the earth also the author explains how the space junk and microdebris fields are made and how they cause problems for spacecrafts
24224,9,2,the author first starts off with an interesting introduction by providing rhetorical statements like 'it's a tool bad then the author gives the reader a background on space junk and what it can do out in outer space the author then concludes that this 'debris' or 'junk' can collide in space and the little fragments can cause damage as well as big fragments
24225,9,1,the author organized this article with different tabs he split every paragraph up into different topics
24226,9,2,the author organizes the article by putting it in sections each title foreshadows what the section will most likely be about in the lines ' orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions ' is under the title orbiting junk which fits the title perfectly
24227,9,2,the author begins with an attention grabbing introduction next they explain what caused the 'space junk' to accumulate then the author warns us of what may happen if we continue to pollute space finally the author states facts that support their statement
24228,9,1,the author begins by grabbing the reader's attention with a startling statement he continues to define the terms that will be used later on in the passage while also explaining some of the history behind the subject then the author offers more facts and support for his claims the author ends with a look at how the subject can alter the world around us
24229,9,0,good not to bad
24230,9,0,what the author is saying is that when we send up a satellite eventully they will brake and they wont get fixed so we send another one up their and some times they will crash into one another and that is how we get space trash
24231,9,0,he puts all the most important information at the beginning
24232,9,0,it provides a question and then provides information
24233,9,1,he first starts with an attention getter then he explains to the reader what space junk is when is started and how he uses an example of space junk by talking about serious collisons with unsed satellites he then describes how fast things are really going in space by using sand as an example
24234,9,2,he begins with a simple introduction which catches the readers attention then he to a serious point where the author starts explaining about space junk once he gets to his point he starts explaining on how useful satillites become space junk over time on how it becomes space junk and dont get taken out and stay there orbitting the earth and end up crashing with each other and become more of a problem
24235,9,1,the author organizes the article in catagories
24236,9,1,the author organizes this article by highlighting the headings of each topic allowing it to stand out the author also uses rhetorical questions
24237,9,2,the author organizes this artical very well they get your attewntion with mutipal thing that draw your attention the author breaks all the important information up into paragraphs so the readers knows whats going on and can learn as much as possible for example the crash cource has nothing aboutnspace junk the author does a good job putting all the information that goes together into one paragraph they dont mix it up and confuse the reraders they make it easy to read and packed full with good information
24238,9,0,they oraganize this artical by what happends for time to time
24239,9,2,the author organized this article by using subtitles like 'what is space junk ' first the author grabed the attention of the reader than began to make the article
24240,9,0,they organize the story by date and years the past events and events that happen now
24241,9,0,the author organizes the article in chronological order he or she stated that in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite in paragraph 6 they stated that in february 2009 two satellites collided into each other finally in 2008 they wrote about how a tool bag escaped from the international space station iss
24242,9,2,the author organizes this article by an attention grabber then telling us what space junk is netx telling us about the collision of satellites in space then lastly the author explains the dangers of space junk in space no matter how small the space junk is it is dangerous
24243,9,0,the author tell us what happens in space and how space agenices work to keep satellites from crashing to each other
24244,9,2,to begin with the author organizes the article in which he gets the readers attention by saying 'grab your telescope look up at the sky its a comet it's a meteor ' next the author tells the reader all of the background information about the space junk in this section it says 'in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite ' then the article tells about the crash course finally it tells about how the little pieces in space are a big deal when they are moving fast these small pieces can cause damage because of the rate of speed that they are moving
24245,9,1,the author opens this article atracting the reader then the author gives us facts about why sapce junk is a serious matter and its increasing so we should work together to make a solution
24246,9,2,the author organizes this article in sections the first paragraph the introduction introduces the topic of the article the second section 'what is space junk ' provides an explanation of what the topic is exactly the third section 'crash course' shows how the problem began the forth section 'little bits but a big deal' shows how important the topic really is in regard to the pollution of the earth
24247,9,2,the author organizes the article into three sections he talks about three very important probles in space one section talks about and describes what is space junk for example it talks about satellites in space and staying there becoming junk the next section talks about space junk crashing into space objects causing harm to space ships the last section talks about a little objects in space can be a big deal
24248,9,2,first theres an introduction and that gets you to want to read and figure out what the purpose of the story is then it explains what space junk is and gives history of how it has been made and some history about satellites after that it gives and example of a time in which an occurance has happened when two satellites collided then the story goes on about what precautions and how dangerous it is when they launch space missions or satellites i thought it was a good way to organize it all
24249,9,0,the author does a very good job of doing the article he tells it step by step so people know what he is saying
24250,9,1,the author organizes this article by putting a hook first 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor ' then he proceeds to tell a breif hisory than he moves to talking about the actual topic of space junk
24251,9,2,the author organizes the article by dividing it into short sections that build upon each other the introduction serves to catch the reader's attention 'what is space junk' informs the reader about what exactly space junk is and the final two sections inform us of the author's opinions on space junk
24252,9,1,the aurthor organize the article by putting the information about when we start to first put satillites into space and then starts talking about other things about the satillites and ends it with they hope that the space agencies will come together and clear up space junk
24253,9,1,in cadigories
24254,9,1,he seperates different tpoics into different paragraphs in each paragraph he describes the topic and gives examples
24255,9,2,the author organizes the article by breaking it up into smaller bits of information that all have to do with one another subject wise the sections in the article are arranged in a way that is easy to understand and gives information so you understand the next article this is obvious because if the author didnt give you the 'what is space junk ' part you wouldn't understand what space junk is in the next two sections
24256,9,1,in sections to support the authors ideas
24257,9,0,he organize it by putting it in a order where you would understand it better
24258,9,2,the author organizes the article by providing an example of space junk why it is occuring and just how dangerous space junk can be in the first section the writer tells about the tool bag and how orbitals for stalites are cluttered in the second and third sections the writer is explaining what space junk is and how it occurs in the last section the writer talk about the problems space junk is posing and how it is more important than people think this organization is effective because the reader wants to continue reading for explanations and examples
24259,9,1,the arthor gives many details why space junk is not good at all some people don't care when others do the author also puts the details in sections and all the information that they are talking about all in one paragraph and they don't skip around they tell us that some people take it seriously and some people don't play around with things like space junk
24260,9,1,the author puts the information into categories
24261,9,0,he he is careful on how he describes the way space jumk is made
24262,9,2,the author starts on a somewhat fast pace trying to grab the reader's attention it starts with how space junk got there and where it all came from and what they put in space then it goes to 'crash course' which tells about how all them satellites and other space debris collide at speeds that are very fast and finally 'little bits' which is about how the little debris can do a lot of damage to orbiting satellites
24263,9,1,he seperates it into different parts
24264,9,1,the author organizes this article by putting the information in different sections he puts the headings as interesting titles so the reader will be interseted before reading the article at the begging of the stroy he uses a retorical question to grab your attention
24265,9,1,the author has organize the paper from introduction which hooks people to the story then the next paragraph he put the informatiom of the begin of the space and the space junk
24266,9,1,the author organizes the article in a way for you to understand the seriousness of space junk it starts out funny but then goes into seriousness and then ends with satistics overall the author just wants to inform the reader on the seriousness and the dangers of space junk
24267,9,0,aneye catching first line thats works its way into the article while using some unique words to catch your eye
24268,9,2,the author starts off by telling us what space junk is which is debrie from satelittes and tools then he tells us how space junk is created he tells us about the collission of two satellites and about and astronaut dropping a tool box next the author says that even the smallest bits of the space junk is harmfull and can do serious damage finally the author comes up with ways to prevent space junk from harming space crafts
24269,9,1,the author oraganized this article with three different titles that are important about space and what people put out there
24270,9,2,the author uses different titles and descriptions for each of the paragraphs that are used he describes many of the passages by showing what can happen for example in 'crash course' he tells about how satellites can come to collide with each other and cause serious damage and make more space debris also in the passage 'little bits but a big deal' the author shows what can happen to an object whenever it gets hit by debris by noting what a sandblaster can do to a concrete wall
24271,9,1,the auther organizes this pasage vary well in my retrospect the way he or she is trying to orginize the fallowing artical is into littel sections of diffrent paraphrase to help the reader orginize the diffrent information in there head so it makes it well writin
24272,9,0,the article was about how a orbiting junk they talked about tool bag space junk is currently of great
24273,9,0,the author organizes this article with the facts first then alll the supporting details then what hes trying to get across witch would be the space junk can be very harmfull to anyone or anything travling through space
24274,9,2,the author breaks the article into three parts which are what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal the author does this so he can get the point of each section across in an easier way to understand
24275,9,2,the author begins with an introduction intended to catch the reader's attention he then explores the topic in more detail using three different sections the first one entitled 'what is space junk ' explains how space junk comes to orbit the earth the next section 'crash course ' describes what happens when multiple pieces of space junk collide finally 'little bits but a big deal ' explains why space junk is a problem and why it is important to find a solution
24276,9,2,the author organizes the article by breaking down the main points into sessions instead of just reading it with no explanation it starts off with a problem the problem is explained the problem happens then finally it says how the problem can be taken care of the introduction is riveting and makes makes people want to read more of the article it holds attention by starting off with seeing something up in the sky the next two paragraphs explian what space junk is it tells what is happening in space and how many problems arrived in space they raise the awarness of what is happening in space and how it could be a problem in the future the section titled crash cousrse tells us the problem it says how it is not safe and how an accident happend in space with all the debris flying around finally the last section tells us how we can care clean up is possible but it is still dangerous in space many fragments float around that cannot be detected it also says that space agencies are working together to make space debris free the article is organized chronoligically they state a problem and throughout the paragraph they say what happens and how efforts are being amde to make it better
24277,9,0,the author gets us thinking about space and the things that go on then gives us the history about the space exploration and the dangers there are in space the author tells us about all the space junk especially that can be seriously dangerous all the information lead up to the fact that there is a lot of junk floating around in space thats dangerous and that the satellites could collide because it has happened before
24278,9,1,he orders the passge by what space junk is how it gets there and the problem it is causing
24279,9,0,this article is based on the organization of things in space such as bad things good things and historical things this article has information about trash in space collision of satellites and junk throughout space
24280,9,1,he puts the article in different sections to organize the main points in each section for example space junk can be anything released into space
24281,9,1,it starts off with startling statements to pull the reader in then goes over a brief history about space junk then explains how dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other and then talks about the importance of space junk in the paragraph 'little bits but a big deal '
24282,9,2,'what is space junk ' is kind of like an introduction to the seriousness of the passage it tells us some starter facts and other things 'crash course' explains a couple starter facts that introduce us to 'little bits but a big deal' 'little bits but a big deal' kind of wraps up the entire passage and explains into more detail what space junk really is and the dangers of it it explains that it's not going like five miles and hour but thousands
24283,9,0,the author organized the article by stating the problem then telling what they are gives information about how serious this situation is
24284,9,2,the author divides the article into 3 sections and an introduction each section has a main focus but is still an idea within the main topic of space debris the introduction is used to draw the reader in with odd statements that one does not usually here then in the first section the author introduces the topic of space debris and gives a brief explaination the following section explains collisions involving space debris the last section explains the severity of space debris and sumarizes the article
24285,9,2,the author organizes the article by putting the information into catagories they give a brief summary in the introduction and go straight into the first section 'what is space junk ' the author explains what space junk is and how it is formed next they go into what happens if two space satellites collide with each other in the 'crash course' section of the article they give examples about this topic and finally they end the article with the 'little bits but a big deal' section this talks about the seriousness of space junk so overall the author chooses to organize the article by sorting the information into subjects based on the different topics of space junk this makes the article very easy to read and to understand
24286,9,2,the aurthor organizes the article by using headers the author has an introduction and then information on the space junk itself what the space junk does and how big of a deal it is
24287,9,2,the author organizes the article by catching the readers attention with the introduction and then give the reader son historical facts about how the space junk got into space the author then states that the satilites are at a higher risk of coliding with each other and causeing more debry the last section the author mentions is that the smallest debri can cause massive damage to a space craft that is in orbit
24288,9,1,he organizes it by atracting the reader then he goes into telling about the history and other facts about satallites next he tells about the importance of space junk and how it effects us
24289,9,1,he organize the article in section of title
24290,9,2,the author organizes the article in sections furst the author opens with an introduction to grab the readers attention then the author gives some background information about what space junk really is the author than staes an instance where space junsk acused an accident finally the author ends the article by telling of the dangers of space kunk and what it can do to effect the earth
24291,9,1,the author for this article organizes it by first having an interesting hook to draw readers in such as 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor it's a toolbag ' he then gives readers a little background information on the subject by explaining how space junk came about and how it affects astronauts finally the author ends this article by explaining to readers why space debris is such a huge problem
24292,9,1,the author keeps this article organized by starting out with 'what is space junk' telling and informing the reader about what space junk is and the history of space junk then it goes to the next section going into detail in the 'crash course' artice where it talkes about how space junk is always colliding and in a crash course finially it talks about how the smaller pieces of junk could be the works parts of the junk in the little bits but a big deal' section
24293,9,2,the author organizes the artical by subtitles some of the subtitles they used are what is space junk and crash course
24294,9,2,the author first introduces the idea of space junk and the government's concern with it he then writes of how the 'junk' gets into the atmosphere and who has caused this issue he tells of the variety as well next he points out the danger of dead satellite collisions and again specifies some of the reasons that such debri occur in space he goes on to make sure that all realize that this is dangerous to themselves so that they do not blatantly disregard the article he emphasizes the danger of small particles at high speeds to those on earth and those in space he also writes of the increase in space junk that is occurring due to commercial space travel he also reveals the hope that corporations and nations have to come up with viable solutions to space pollution this organization is done to make sure to hold the interest of the reader until the end so that they will finish reading the article to educate themselves on the issue of space junk and how it pertains to them
24295,9,2,the author organizes the article by giving information about space junk then providing the dangers of it they then explain how space junk is created by space capsules telescopes satellites and even astronauts themselves at the end of the article the author explains ways scientists are trying to solve the problem but will not be able to fully do so this shows how serious the problem is
24296,9,0,it is a great concern to the government around the globe
24297,9,2,he puts it into sections first he tells what space junk is next he tells how it is created last he tells how cares about this and tells that nasa is looking for a solution for space junk
24298,9,1,the author divides them into three catagories to show as much information as possible in the first section he talks aabout the history then in the last two sections he talks about the serious risk of space junk
24299,9,1,i think the author organizes the article very well the author organized it so you know when you are changing subjects and so you will know the different things the author is talking about everything you need to know about space junk is divided into different areas so you won't have to learn about too much at one time
24300,9,2,the author organizes this article by starting it off with an interesting scenario then after he gains our attention he explains what space junk is after that he tells us how even space junk is small it can still provide a large amount of damage because of the speed it is traveling at the author then closes the article by giving in detail how the different space agencies planned to solve the problem of space debris this article was organized to give facts to the reader but at the same time make it easy to understand and interesting
24301,9,1,the article is very well organized it starts out with an introduction that grabs the reader's attention then it gives a definition of the subject of the article it then tells introduces the problems associated and why there needs to be a solution this set up works well because it gives a lot of information but it is easy to understand
24302,9,0,he starts offtalking about the the history then he goes in to more depth about how dangerous they can be and the problems they can cause
24303,9,2,the author organizes this article by explaining what space junk is what space junk can cause and the harm that it can do to the expensive material in space and it also shows how even the smallest material orbiting the earth can be a large hazzard to satellites
24304,9,0,he starts out with a quston and then anssars it
24305,9,2,the author organizees the article in an easy to understand way first the author catches your attention and states the problem then in the section 'what is space junk ' they quickly describe what space junk is and how it is created in the section titled 'crash course' the author shows evidence of satellites colliding and how they produced more microdebris in the final section they explain how the space garbage can cause complications for spacecraft overall the article was assembled in a simple way that made it easy to understand for any reader
24306,9,2,the author organized the article by using an introduction what an attention getter to get the reader's interest he she then uses facts about the history of earth's space invasion which caused the mess of space junk afterwards the author explains that space junk can collide into one another lastly he she explains why it is a big deal to many people why space junk is dangerous
24307,9,0,he puts each peice that goes togather in the same paragraph and is good about it by not leaving antything out
24308,9,0,tolf reder somr happen
24309,9,2,the author organizes the article into four different sections the author first starts the article with an introduction paragraph about space junk that foreshadows what the rest of the article contains then the article has a section that gives background infromation about how space junk came to life the next section gives actual examples of what can happen when random space junk is orbiting the earth finally the last section tells the reader how dangerous space junk can be at high speeds and how this space pollution is still affecting space travel today
24310,9,1,the author does not mix around his information in one paragraph he is telling you about things up in space in another paragraph he may be saying something like how satelittes are controled so there are no crashes
24311,9,0,he organizes the articles by importance
24312,9,0,he puts what matters first like what is space junk and then goes on too things that happen in the 1900's and how space junk in polluting
24313,9,1,they first start off with somthing to get your atecntion then they inform you about what space junk it then they tell what it can do to hurt space traveling then they tell you how much damage can be done by the debris then last they tell you the problem is increasing and that the world needs to work together to figure out how to fix it
24314,9,1,the author dreate subtitles for each section when he changes what he is talking about
24315,9,0,the organization of this article tells you little by little to show how it can be a big deal from the beginning to the end
24316,9,1,the author organizes the article by using an introductory paragraph that catches the readers attention the author then moves on in the next paragraph and talks about the dangers that space exploration puts on the earth by leaving behind debrie as the article goes on it discusses how dangerous collisons from these debries are too
24317,9,1,the author organizes this article by having rhetorical questions to get the reader's attention and then he gets serious and tells some historical facts about the space debris after he states that he tells more about the satellites and other machines in space used for world communication
24318,9,2,he begins with an introduction and then goes on the describe what space junk is then talks about a crashing of satellites and then finally why such small pieces are such a big deal
24319,9,0,the article is organized by giving definition asking questions and giving examples an example is 'what is space junk ' and it tells definition and how it effects astronauts
24320,9,1,at first the author let's us know what they will be talking about after that they tell us and give examples of what 'space junk' is then they argue there point on how dangerous and harmful it is
24321,9,2,the author starts out in the introduction by really getting you ready for what is to come in the fourth to fifth paragraph she explains what the space junk is and what it means for us in the crash course section she talks about satellites and how they have failed to work before and how that affects things in the last section she explains why that space junk is harmful and what it does for space exploration
24322,9,0,the author orders the article in chronoligical order in paragrah for its starts off with 1957 then in paragrapgh 5 its states over the pas 52 years
24323,9,1,he uses title for each part it he is talking about that way the reader can find what he is looking for very easier
24324,9,2,the author organizes the aritcle by topic such as the titles 'what is space junk ' and 'crash course' these titles help us understand the things the author is trying to explain
24325,9,0,the author organizes the article by importance to the universe he starts with the most important things then goes down to stuff that's not as important he gives details on everything to help you better understand what it is used for
24326,9,0,the author starts out drawing the reader into the article then he starts with the history of space accidents and starts to describe the harmfulness of orbiting junk
24327,9,2,it begins with a humorous surprising hook followed by explaining what 'space junk' is after it tells readers about examples of said 'space junk' and ends with why people should care about it the titles of the section and article 'orbiting junk' 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' do a good job at summing up what the sections and article is about
24328,9,2,the author has organized this article by asking questions or stating a subtitle for the next paragraph to answer one subtitle is named 'crash course' the paragraph then explains how the crash coarse in made and how it is dangerous
24329,9,1,he starts off by telling the reader about what 'space junk' is an tells the reader about its effects on spaceships and what not he tells the reader that even little things can have a big impact
24330,9,1,he buts the article into diffenert group so you can read about the one group at a time
24331,9,0,taco
24332,9,2,the author organizes his article by using different sections that each describe different aspects of space junk the first section describes what space junk is and what happens to it the second section describes how some of the trash is generated through dead satellite collisions or small things like a lost tool bag the last section describes why space debris can cause serious problems for spacecraft and reseach stations the debris can be undecectable by military radar and travel at such speeds to the point of being highly dangerous
24333,9,2,in this article the author has organized it in a unique way the author has used the providing information to contrast the harmful dangers of space junk the article is seperated in different categories where that topic is explained the author tries to emphasize the importance of the outcome we will have if people ignore this situation with no one to control the dead satellites they run with great risks of 'colliding with each other ' this can cause a harmful effect and is what happened in february 2009 this impact caused hundreds of pieces of debris each assuming its own orbital path
24334,9,2,the author organizes this article by putting similar information together and leading up to the conclusion he starts with the introduction by introducing 'space junk' then he provides the audience with information about what space junk is the author then gives the audience information on how effective crashes can be in space he finishes off by telling the audience how these small things in space can make a huge impact
24335,9,2,the author follows the introduction with background information on the history of space exploration and introduces the urge of different countries to begin researching space the author than transitions from speaking about satellites that begin orbiting into the dangers involving collisions between objects in space to add credibility a actual account is stated that relates how serious this problem of space junk can be finally the importance of safety is again stressed and it is said that the problem has not yet been solved
24336,9,1,the author organizes the problem by starting at the beggining when we first started exploring space then the author goes in order from there and tells us how so much debri gets into the orbit around earth then the author tells us how dangerous it is and how we can detect it but there is nothing we can do about it
24337,9,0,the author organizes this article in a smart and strategic way at the beginning he catches the reader's eye by making an exctining sentence and it goes like this 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a ' and so forth that is exciting on my part and made me want to read this after the exctining part the author got serious about his article and started to state the dangers about 'space junk'
24338,9,1,the auther organizes this article by order of importance the auther tells about launching space crafts then moves into the importance of space junk and how space junk creates crash courses
24339,9,1,the author organizes the artical with a title and subheadings he uses three subheadings to organize it
24340,9,1,he organizes it with history then more current events what is space junk crash course little bits but a big deal
24341,9,1,the author organizes the article in order of importance he first introduces the idea of space junk posing a problem describes how it has occurred and closes with startling information about how space pollution is a very large threat to space exploration
24342,9,1,he organizes it by putting sections and paragraphs in it also by naming everything
24343,9,2,the author organizest the article very well the author uses the introduction to get the point across he then does a good job in explaining what space junk really is and how it is increasing as we are now doing more and more space research this is followed by the section crash course which explains how space junk causes collisions in orbit the next section emphasizes the damage this space junk can cause to space crafts and other research satellites the ending is also very well thought out restatign the problem and showing how it is an increasing problem i liked this article and thought it was very well organized by the author
24344,9,2,the author organizes the article by addressing a brief history of space travel and a brief description of what exactly space junk is then it gives us some examples of what caused some space junk to accumulate and make microdebris fields lastly they address what they have tried to do to reduce the amount of space junk that is orbitting our planet
24345,9,2,the author organizes this article by using different sections the article uses the section 'what is space juck ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal ' the cause for this is to have everything more organized
24346,9,1,her organizes the story by using pargraphs that contain a specific topic these pargraphs have titles above to give you and idea of the point about to be made
24347,9,1,the author organizes the article as orbiting junk explains what space junk is the crash course and why little bits are a big deal
24348,9,0,they organize it by the data in 'what is spave junk' they stick to just describing certain things and then when they wanted to go to a new subject they went into 'crash course ' they kept all of the same ideas together instead of running them all together
24349,9,2,the author organizes this article in sequential order the article starts by telling you what 'space junk' is then the author tells you what affects it has on satellites finally the author explains how the debris is small and it makes it hard for astronauts to see it this article is in sequential order because it shows the sequence in which the events happen
24350,9,0,he organizes the article from most dangerous to the solutions or what we are working on to be our solutions
24351,9,1,the author starts the article with a fun attention getter and then swtiches to a more serious organized fashion of writing it is split into 4 detailed topics that explain space junk
24352,9,2,the author organizes this piece very well do to the fact that everything is titled and is in there own little section for example when they talk about the debres crashing into things they placed that in the crash course section of the piece
24353,9,2,in the article 'orbiting junk' the author arranges the artcile in a logical sense he starts out with the introduction which uses rhetorical questions and well known phrases to grab your attention he then moves on to inform you of the main problem of 'space junk' with his primary thesis the next section the author writes is 'what is space junk ' and this section has one major goal to inform us readers with the definition of space junk in addition the author provides use with facts that show the length of time space 'junk' can exist in orbit 'the objects themselves however are positioned hundreds of miles above earth far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up' the next section is crash course this section shows how space junk gets into the atmosphere through the examples of american russian satellites colliding with each other or an astronaut accidently releasing a tool bag the next section 'little bits but a big deal' focuses on the hard hitting truth that space debris can cause severe damage to space shuttles and astronauts the author shows how undetectable pieces of debris also known as microdebris can cause sigfnifigant damage through the comparison to the sand particles used in a sandblaster the author closes his article with his conclusion that space trash is increasing in volumn and size because of commerical space travel and how we need to undertake a solution to space pollution
24354,9,2,the author seperates the article into a build up introduction and then different potential issues that can arise from space junk the introduction goes along with 'what is space junk ' build up and the other sections are issues arisin due to space junk
24355,9,1,the author organizes the article by splitting up the diffrent sections of the diffrent serious matters there's the space junk and the reasons for it being there and how unnecessary it is
24356,9,1,the author organize the article in sections with headers the headers tell us what the sections are about
24357,9,2,the author organizes the article by first grabbing the reader's attention with the sentence 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor it's a tool bag ' this passage is interesting and makes the reader want to read more then the reader is told that this can actually happen and that this article is going to be about space junk next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there the article explains how the space junk is the stuff that doesn't fall back to earth so it isn't burned up in the atmosphere instead it floats around in space the article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk in the next section crash course we are told why satellites can be considered space junk and what happens when they collide we also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space but by now the reader is wondering why this matters and what problems could come from these little bits of debris the author brings us to the answer with the section little bits but a big deal this section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems a useful metaphor of sand and sandblasters is used here to put this problem into a perspective that can be understood easier by the general public lastly the article explains what is being done about this problem so in a more general form we are hooked into the story then given a problem then the problem is explained in more detail then we are told why it's a problem and lastly what solutions are out there and what is being done to solve this problem this method of organization ensures that the reader is never confused and is given the information in a logical order answering the reader's questions directly as they come
24358,9,0,the author starts this article in a playful mood and then gets serious they start of with comments and then start withthe facts in the beginning the author says 'grab you telescope look up in the sky it's a meteor ' then they go on to list facts like ' in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial stellite '
24359,9,1,the author gives informative statements that are directly connected to each topic every topic or paragraph fit together and make sense as a whole thought the article flows and is easy to understand each topic is supported with greatly explained examples
24360,9,1,he starts off with exclamatory sentences to grab the reader's attention he then goes into a paragraph that informs the reader of what he is going to be talking about then he talks a little bit about space junk and the harmful effects of it then he lets the readers know that objects in space travel a very high speeds and dont have to be very big to pose a problem
24361,9,1,first he uses short anektot to get readers attantion then he uses historical information so that it would be easyer for reader to understand the problem afterwards he is using some modern facts to put more emphesis on the problem then he conludes the artical by stating that problem won't be solved if people won't get involved
24362,9,2,the author organizes this article by separating the information into different sections each focusing on one aspect of the main subject with each individual section leading into the next in the first section for example the main idea is introduced through a creative opening that grabs the reader's attention and provokes interest in the topic the next section then offers a more elaborate explanation of the topic of the article and a short history of how the problem of 'space junk' began the author then goes on to explain what happens to the debris and how collisions occur the last section then explains why the collisions are a problem despite the small size of the debris in this way the information from each section builds upon what was presented in the preceding section but each has its own specific topic as this is an informational article it is arranged in a logical order to provide the best understanding of the facts
24363,9,0,the author organizes the article by starting out by grabbing the readers attention then tells historical fact and how it effects this article and finally the author tells other important facts related to the situation of 'space junk'
24364,9,2,the author starts out with a little background story of the 'great space race' and how the effects when it comes into earth atmosphere in crash course the author gives a story of what happen in february 2009 between two dead satellites and introing the paragraph into the next paragraph in little bits but a big deal explain the affects of sapce juck once the tiny fragments hits any spacecraft or satillites they could cause serious damage like and affect space obervations in the future
24365,9,2,he organizes this article by first talking about what space junk is during that paragraph he talks about satellites and what happens when they die or malfunction he then tells people about the satellites and what happens to them then he goes into what space trash and space junk is
24366,9,0,he makes you interested in the story right away then he gives a lot of statistcs and facts
24367,9,0,such an observation isn't as strange as it seems orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions this space junk is currently of great concern to governmet space agencies around the globe
24368,9,0,some people lke stuff about like about space than other people do because commercial space travelis on the rise and more nations have undertaken space explortion
24369,9,2,the author organizes the article by talking about the least important things to the most important things he first talks about space junk which is not all that important except that it does effect space then he talks about crashes that have happened and the importance of what happened finaly he then talks about space microdebris which realy affects the space which could destroy astronauts spaceships whenever they go up to space

24403,9,2,the author organizes this article by seperating the information into different catagories he begins with a simple introduction to hook the reader then he goes on to explain what space junk is and how it is formed the third section describes the dangerous collisions that take place in space between the different satellites and such the very last section states that even small bits of space debris can cause a big problem overall the author did a great job of informing the reader about his point of view
24404,9,2,the author organizes the articles by putting them in categories for instance they are what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal they help the reader by telling them what the paragraph is mostly going to be about that way they are not confused for what is going on
24405,9,0,the author oraganized the passage starting about orbiting junk
24406,9,2,first the author gives an introduction informing the readers what the article will be about then the next section explains what space junk is the explanation includes the background of it and how it happens after that section the author writes about different occurances and the details of space junk the final section talks about the power of space junk falling from the atmosphere it also explains why it is a problem and how the problem is being fixed
24407,9,2,the author organize the article by using subheading and a strong intro one of the subheadings is what is space junk the author also uses varies fact throughout the article

24413,9,2,the author organizes the article by first stating that space junk can be dangerous after that he explains what space junk is and where it comes from in the section 'crash course' the author shows how free roaming space equipment can be dangerous and hurt an astronaut or a satellite at the end of the article the author states how nasa is trying to fix the problem to make it more safe for people and spacecrafts
24414,9,2,the author organizes this article into paragraphs of each topis with a title that sums up the main idea of the paragraph in the paragraph 'what is space junk' the author talks about the history of space travel and things going and getting stuck in space 'crash course' was given a clever title because it talks about space collisions and the last paragraph 'little bits but a big deal' explains why space debris is so important do this time of set up is very good to organize the article and make it simple
24415,9,1,he talks about the 'orbiting junk' and how it goes around the earth he talks about 'what is space junk' and how much trash there is in space he talks about 'crash course' and how there is almost always crashes in space then he talks about 'little bits but a big deal' and how much trash goes into space
24416,9,2,the author organizes this article in an effective way it is easy to find what information that you will find in the different sections the author starts the article with a statement that grabs the readers attnetion then moves into explaining what space junk is and giving some back gournd information then the article moves into explaining the dangers of space junk and the potential that it has to affect earthly beings
24417,9,2,the author organized the article using topic headlines he or she chose to introduce the idea of space junk initially and called it 'what is space junk ' the second section was about what happens when satellites collide 'crash course' the third and final topic addresses the gravity of the situation expressing how consequential the microdebris actually is in 'little bits but a big deal'
24418,9,1,orbiting junk is about looking in the sky to find 'junk' what is space junk is about different satellites crash course is about satellites crashing in with each other little bits but a big deal is saying space junk is harmful
24419,9,1,the author organizes the article in a good sequence for example the author starts by telling you what is space junk then goes on to crash course and finally goes and tells you about little bits but a big deal
24420,9,2,the author organizes this article into four main sections the first of these sections is the introduction where he grabs the reader's attention with an observation and the problem we are facing in the second section of this article the author goes on to further explain the problem and how the problem is caused the author begins with the first time a satellite was sent into space and how the satellite may eventually become another piece of space junk by malfunctioning in the third section titled 'crash course' the author explains how the problem is progressively becoming worse he says that if two of these malfunctioning satellites collide with each other they would create hundreds of pieces of debris in the fourth and final section of the article the author states that many people are concerned about this problem and how it will affect us spaceships could be seriously damaged by these pieces of microdebris that is undetectable by our current technology
24421,9,2,the author organizes the article by firstly creating a good 'hook' to get the reader interested in the rest of his her article from here the author explains the beginnings of space exploration and how space junk has been emerging as a growing problem since then paragraph 5 after this the author further explains and provides reasoning for the growing amount of space junk in the atmosphere and the problems it poses after this the author explains why even the smallest objects can be the most dangerous and hazardous to spacecraft finally the author wraps up the article by restating the problem increasing amounts of space pollution and by concluding the article
24422,9,0,he puts his matters in a groups of his ideas then goes on to the next topic he has to talk about
24423,9,2,firstly the author grabs the readers attention then author jumpss right into details as two what is 'space junk' is and how it got into space thirdly the author explains how satellites collide in space and become 'space junk' lastly the author imposes on the danger and importance of preventing space pollution
24424,9,0,the author organizes this article by representing facts and statements the author explains and tries to come up with a solution
24425,9,0,the author organize the article by going straight in to 1957 the soviet union the first artificial satellite telling us the readers that they have been around for a long time and make sure you dont miss anything then the author goes in to 2009 telling us that the same thing happened dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other he also tell us about the future and what might happen if were not carefull

24432,9,2,in the introduction the author tries to hook the reader in about 'space junk ' then he tries to explain what 'space junk' is and that it is a great concern around the globe for example in the article it stated that microdebris fields are so small that they cannot be detected and if it hits a spacecraft it can be damaged the author also states that if space agencies help then maybe space pollution will decrease
24433,9,1,the author organizes tis artical by starting wih history and what is space junk then continues on explaining how junk gets smaller also how small it is and the problem if poses
24434,9,0,hahaha this school expects me to do this lol how funny dumb school
24435,9,0,space junk is basiclly like littering satelites are trying to connect to these problems by reducing so much space junk even the military and nasa were trying to find out the whole situation the aurthor trying to tell the reader that space junk could lead to many problems to the universe the only way they can do that is to reduce many space junk to decrease less astroids taking over the universe
24436,9,1,tey lay it out from what what is space junk which expalins what is space junk then crash course expalins how space junk is deadly when passed and can run risk and lastly how does effect a spacecraft when space junk is passed and how it must bemade stronger
24437,9,1,the author tells us about the many things that have happened in up in space and haow to prevent everythimg

24441,9,1,he has the introduction then he goes into details about what the space junk really is the actual harmful ways it has and that even though the garbage maybe small it is effective
24442,9,1,the author first gets you interested with an entertaining introduction after this they must explain hwhat exactly space junk is so the reader is not confused the the author shows some real world examples of space junk finally the auther discusses the real dangers of space junk it is in sort of a level of importance order
24443,9,2,the author organizes this article intofour smaller articles that all have an overlying topic that is 'space junk' this allows the reader to take in as mcuh information as possible it also allows the reader to know where specific details come from and find them very quickly
24444,9,2,frist he give a introduction leting you know what the article is about then he gives you what is space junk and goes on to explin what its chrash coures explains the dangers of space junk
24445,9,0,the author tell it in peaces doesnt just cram it all in on thing he tell how it happens when it happens and were it happens

24448,9,2,he starts out by explaining to the reader what space junk is he talks about things that have gone wrong in space to cause the space junk to be orbiting around in space then he proceeds to talk about crash course which is when something is in space and it shouldn't be there it causes a threat to astronaunts in space finally he talks about little bits but a big deal in this paragraph he is explaining that even though it may seeem like a small thing to us here on earth but in space it is a big deal and it could cause serious problems for future space travel
24449,9,2,the author organizes the article by first explaining what the problem is they then highlight what is causing this problem and give many examples of satellites that have turned into 'space junk' next they talk about how harmful these tiny fragments can be finally they offer a positive note by stating that 'space agencies hope that the corporations and nations involved can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution'
24450,9,0,the author organized the article by having different passages of his story
24451,9,2,the author starts by explaining to us about the concern of space junk then he tells us that dead satellites have the risk of crashing into each other creating hundreds of pieces of dedris lastly he tells us that little bits of space junk can have a big impact on spacecraft
24452,9,0,in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite
24453,9,0,he organize it good
24454,9,1,the author organizes the article by separating it into different topics
24455,9,2,the auther orabizes the article in sections diffrent sections depending on what the paragaph was about the first was space junk that described what space junk is and how it came about the second was 'little bits but a big bit' witch described how even small peces of space junk affect the space ships
24456,9,1,the author puts this artictle in such a way that it gives you the most important things near the end and just some of the minor facts in the begining of the article
24457,9,1,the author organizes the article into chapters each section has a title and covers a subtopic from the main idea
24458,9,2,the author organizes the article in a way that is almost like a timeline he or she first starts out by saying that you see something fall from space that is unusual to see he or she then tells you what space junk is then the author tells you why this is a problem by saying that space junk can crash into other space junk and space ships he or she finally tells you that people care about what is happening in space and that they would like to do something about it in the future
24459,9,0,the author catigorizes different topics filled with evidence to proove to the readers that it is harmful in many different ways

24461,9,2,the author organizes the article well by putting information in certain sections the author for example talks about an american and russian satellite colliding into each other the author puts thihs information under a section called crash course the author puts the information into specificly titled sections which makes this a very organized passage
24462,9,2,the author organizes the article by putting it into specific sections the introduction which was to get the reader interested 'what is space junk' which was to describe the debris and the effect it's having on earth 'crash course which was to provide details about how satellies have crashed due to this debris and last the closer paragraph 'little bits but a big deal' which describes that just the littlest of space debris can be harmful
24463,9,0,facts
24464,9,2,the author organizes the article by seperating different topics into different sections for example when the author wants to inform readers about what space junk actually is the author titles that section 'what is space junk '
24465,9,0,he she write different fact about the different way of space like in 1957 the soviet union and in february 2009
24466,9,2,the author organizes this article in a very organized way the article begins with an enticing introduction curious readers will want to continue reading the article to learn about what 'space junk' is and what it does the next section explains to readers what space junk is it explains how space junk got into the atmosphere where it is located and how space junk came about in the atmosphere the third section descirbes a specific event that led to space junk the final section explains the dangers of space junk it also informs readers of how scientists are trying to overcome the issue of space junk
24467,9,1,the author organizes the article in chronological order first is the introduction paragraph to let you know of the subject or situation then is the first p2 where they explain exactly what space junk is after that they talk about a situation where space junk problems have occurred then they signify how space junk is a problem
24468,9,2,at first he starts out saying things to catch your attention then he goes into giving informatin at history of junk in the atmosphere once the author is done with that he talks about how dangerous the tiny particles of space junk can be very harmful to the astronaunts that go into space
24469,9,0,he organizes his article with the most important facts to the least important by explaining why things are more important then others
24470,9,2,the author sorted the article into four main sections these are the introduction a section titled 'what is space junk ' a section called 'crash course' and the conclusion titled 'little bits but a big deal' he or she included a variety of information in each of these sections in the introduction the author opens with a surprising statement of a toolbag in space then the article goes on to say that space junk is becoming a problem the body paragraphs in the next two sections expand on this problem by explaining what space junk actually is and what other challenges it poses in the conclusion section the author wraps up the article with the main problems space junk poses
24471,9,1,the author first starts with the shocking realization that there is 'space junk' floationg in space the author then organizes each paragraph into importance in 'what is space junk ' the author explains what the whole article is about then in 'crash course' the author explains how the debris and 'space junk' happen lastly the author explains the importance and the real impact that 'space junk' has on the space envirioment
24472,9,1,the author organizes the article into different sections explaining space junk he also is organizing the facts of article into past present and future tense
24473,9,2,the author organizes the article in different titled sections the introduction to draw you into the article the second section to describe the space junk the third to show what happens when space junk collides and the last section to show that very small space junk is a large problem for space crafts
24474,9,2,the author organizes the article by breaking it down in four sections each section is a a little more detailed and serious than the last section one is the explaination of the story section two talks about what space junk is section three explains the dangers of orbiting satellites and section four explains the way scientists are trying to find solutions to the space junk problem sections one is the introductory it grabs the readers attention and keeps them interested section two describles a little bit about the history of space exploration it also explains what happens to satellites over time when they are orbiting in space for a long period section three explains the dangers of satellites crashing in outerspace it also gives an example of two satellites colliding with one another and spreading tiny debris all over space section four explains the seriousness of this debris and explains what nasa and the european space agency are trying to do in each of these paragraphs it explains the importance of cleaning up our space system i have learned that space is a dangerous and sometimes life threatening place
24475,9,0,the author organized the article to avoid giving to much information about one subject he wants the article to give simpler information
24476,9,1,the author starts with the larger objects that float around in space and end with the smaller ones that are just as dangerous
24477,9,1,starts with wondering whats floating around in space then gives a lot of facts about why junk floating around in space is such a big deal junk floating around in space has an affect on the earths surface
24478,9,1,to begin the author introduces the topic of space junk then the author describes how space junk enters earth's orbit and poses problems by describing these occurances in chronological order first the satellites are introduced to earth's orbit then they begin to crash into each other and create microdebris and after that point virtually nothing can be done to eliminate their threat
24479,9,2,the author organizes the article with different sections that go in a logical order according to what the artilce is talking about the different sections the authour uses are 'orbiting junk' as the introduction 'what is space junk ' as a body part of the body 'crash course' as another part of the body and 'little bits but a big deal' as the conclusion
24480,9,1,he organizes this article by putting titles above each of his new subjects
24481,9,0,he gives it in order of what he feels is important
24482,9,2,the author organize his artivle very well he starts off with a quite commical introduction but then changes tone and become very serious when talking about the next section 'what is space junk ' then he continues and talk about the section 'crash crouse' next he then explain his next section 'little bits but a big deal' he was very organize and got his point across
24483,9,0,the author organizes his article to make it simplistic enough for all readers young and old
24484,9,2,the author organizes this article by splitting it up into several sections with each section informing a different subtopic while staying relevant to the overall subject at hand he begins with a general definition of space junk in the introduction to warm up the readers for what is to come then in the next section he begins to change his tone as he starts the discussion on pollution in space in crash course he explains that satellites will also collide with each other and make the problem bigger becoming even more serious yet in tone he then concludes with his last section by stating the severity of the subject and implying that something needs to be done about the problem
24485,9,2,the author begins by grabbing your attention with a snappy little anecdote after that he goes into a short explaination of how orbital pathways around our planet are becoming more cluttered then he explains what the 'space junk' actually is then he talks about how satellites can colide with space junk and be destroyed lastly the author explains how dangerous a small piece of debris traveling at a high rate of speed can greatly affect the structural integrity of manned space craft and satellites alike
24486,9,1,the author puts the article by putting the information in separate categories by doing this they can give more details about the specifics of space junk
24487,9,1,the article is organized in a way that helps the reader understand more and more about the topic as the information is presented the author starts off by stating the topic and summarizing the rest of the article ths second paragraph explains what created the problem the third paragraph shares what the problem has already caused in the recent years finally the last paragraph addresses the problem one last time explaining why it is so serious the author also tries to give some solutions but ends with an optimistic thought that corporations and nations will hopefully come up with a solution soon
24488,9,2,the author organizes the article very effectively the article's introduction is very simple but provides a small sense of suspense and expectation the reader knows where the article is headed but isn't quite sure of the minute details the author then switches to a more serious tone to convey the facts and statistics trying to prove a point the middle paragraphs were organized effectively to provide background information to the problem at hand the author then closes with informing the reader of how the problem is being dealt with and how hard it is to deal with
24489,9,1,he oranizes it well he starts with space junk which tell you about what happens with the degraded or burned up earth elements then it goes to crash course and talks about satellites then they talk about what people think of space junk and satellites
24490,9,0,the author organized t he aticle in different paragraphs that each hit a certion point
24491,9,1,it starts by telling us what space junk is and how its got started in paragragh four titled 'what is space junk ' then is goes on to tell us in 'crash course' it tells us about accidents that have happened and how dead satellites can hit each other and cause problems lastly 'little bits but a big deal' show how they can be a deal danger and why the problem should be fixed
24492,9,0,author want the reader to read the article then the author tell the reader about what is space junk like in 1657 the soviet union luanuched an artificial satellite and over 52 years there has been a vartiy of space carft
24493,9,0,the author organized the article very well and in order
24494,9,2,the author first's gets your attention with an allusion from superman he then starts telling us a little more on what he's talking about and actually defines 'space junk' in a pretty lengthy paragraph finally he tells us of incidents dealing with space junk and the problems that will keep occuring if we don't do something about it
24495,9,1,the author has chapters in between each different topic
24496,9,2,the organization of the article begins with an introduction that catches the attention of the reader these opening statements are commonly said before a spectacle in the sky that are rarely seen but always beautiful the author continues with background information the next paragraphs gives a definition of space junk we also get a briefing on the space race and satellites in outer space the author shows the importance of these things when he refers to communication satellites by making this reference readers feel more personal to the subject because our generation are so absorbed by communication devices the next paragraphs describe the effect of the crashes of space junk it describes the debris left in space by satellites and space shuttles the next section shows the importance of speed in the crashes just a little bit of speed is able to cause lethal damage to space shuttles in closing the author tells about the efforts of space agencies that are trying to reduce the problem though space junk is increasing the author is hopeful for a solution
24497,9,2,the author organizes the article into three condenced topics about orbitting junk the three topics are 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and little bits but a big deal' the author provides facts and opinions in each subtopic to enlighten the reader about space
24498,9,2,at first the author gives a little bit of backround on what is sent up to space and all the varitety of objects that are sent then he or she starts to explain how the objects have an effect on space and the dangers it comes with the author also organizes it by the titles of the paragraphs

24504,9,1,the author organizes the article in a way that breaks up the material into different sections it makes the article easier to follow and helps the reader understand one subject while the author goes onto another in the introduction and throughout the article the author uses rheotorical questions to keep a reader interested
24505,9,2,the author organizes the article in different sections for example the first section is named what is space junk and the last one is little bits but a big deal by doing this he shows the differnet topices
24506,9,0,its all about how the great invenshons work in ower everyday life and the dangers of spaces and all the trash on the outer rim of the atmosphere
24507,9,0,they have specific facts and little details in certian catagories of his paper
24508,9,0,first he captures your interest with his rhetorical question 'it's a tool bag ' then he gives the reader historical information leading up to our present time
24509,9,2,first the author presents the problem space junk next he explains what space junk is after that he explains how space junk is created which is by free orbiting satellites crashing into each other finally he explains what organizations like nasa and esa are doing to solve the problem the sub paragraphs give it away such as what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
24510,9,0,thw author organizes this article very well he started with explaining what everything was and then went on too explain what it was and how we can maybe stop it from happening
24511,9,0,he goes step by steps he tells us what each thing is like and it really helps out alot

24513,9,1,the author organizes this artile by beginning with information about the history of satellites and space junk in paragraph five the sentence begins with the statement 'over the past 52 years ' this is stating that explaing the history of spacecrafts the next topic is of crashes dead satellites in the past and how the crash effects the future the next topic is of how 'scientists are hard pressed for an easy solution ' in this topic it also explains how the problem still exsists this article is very well oranized
24514,9,2,the author has organized the article by using headers and titles to sort the information for example the header stating 'what is space junk ' has all the information about how space junk has gotten into our atmosphere and what it is the header stating 'crash course' has the information about what happens when two satellites collide
24515,9,0,the author organizes the article in a simple way the author gives you thanking at first than using statistics and makes you thank bout what is gonna happen to all that space junk
24516,9,2,the author organizes the article one step at a time they start off with an introduction that catches the reader's eye then they explain to the reader what space junk is and that it is dangerous after that they tell why space junk is harmful and dangerous finally they end with saying that nasa is trying to fix this problem
24517,9,0,the author organizes the article by putting important facts about space debris amd the affect it could have on the astronauts in space and the atmosphere of earth which can be an harmful thing to the environment around and on earth
24518,9,2,the author begins his article with an attention grabbing introduction with the shocking exclamations then he gives a short introduction saying his story will be about the rising issue of 'space junk ' from this he begins explaining exactly what space junk is and when it first appeared in the atmosphere above space after that he gives a past event from february 2009 and in 2008 as examples of how space junk occurs next he describes the severity of these space crashes by using details such as comparing 'grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall ' this comparison was used very well because it helps create an image of how bad it is when two satelites in space collide finally the author closes his article by telling the reader how big of a problem space junk is becoming and how space agencies are beginning to work together to put a stop to it
24519,9,1,the author starts off with telling us what space junk is then he tells us about history and how two satellites crashed into each other and last but not least he tells us about microdebris who cares about space dust no one controls dead satellites disabled objects in space becomes pieces of high tech junk
24520,9,0,the authors tone is a big attention grabber at the beginning as the story goes on the details increase and get deeper
24521,9,0,the author tells whoever is reading this actual stories of what has happened and dangers of space junk
24522,9,2,the author started with an opening paragraph explaining what the article is going to be discussing the author then gives an explanation for what he or she is writing about the author then writes about how it is harmful to space and our environment the author ends the article giving his or hers opinion about what the artivle is discussing
24523,9,2,they put what things are in space and what they do for space matters then they told what they do to help out and what is all the danger stuff they put little bit of informattion about space and equitmit they use up there they put things that are made to be up there and things that are not sopse to be they put them all in there own catagorie so people can find out simple facts about them very easy without haveing to look around for the information
24524,9,1,he organizes it into different storys with different titles
24525,9,1,i believe is in chronological order according to years in the very section after the introduction it says in 1957 after that it gradually progresses to present day the author also would explain the major problems in the past and work his way up to explaining our modern day problems for example the author talked about 'space junk' in 1957 and later in the article about satellites crashing into one another in 2009
24526,9,2,the author uses many different sections that split up all that he has to say if he didn't conduct the article this way then he would have trouble trying to meld all of his writing together such as the part about orbiting junk and crash course the two of them would not go together very well without the seperation of the sections
24527,9,0,that there is too much junk up in space and the more and more they get is just going to make everything go wrong and soon everything will start to crash
24528,9,2,the author puts the story in different sections for example one section is 'what is space junk ' and the next section is 'crash course'
24529,9,2,at first the author brings you in with starting sentence after that he explains how serious space junk really is then goes on and tells about the space invansion between the countries but the last and maybe most important thing is the microdebris fields the military can not detect anything smaller then a baseball while people may thing a baseball is small and can still hurt our spacecrafts and put our sattelites in danger
24530,9,2,the author starts out with an introduction paragraph that was written in a way to grab the reader's attention and get them to keep reading it's written in an almost comical way by using a phrase that many people have heard before which is the first sentence in reference to the famous 'superman' line then it goes on to paragraph to that is used to explain to the reader just what the rest of the article is going to be about and give a little background information on it it gives facts about how satellites were started and how space junk is formed then it moves on to explain the dangers of this space junk in paragraph 6 7 titled 'crash course ' it explains that anything left up in space can become a danger for other satellites the risks and dangers are further explained in 'little bits but a big deal ' this part explains how even though something can be so small and may be thought of as not a very big deal it can still cause a lot of damage it gives the sand example that says that something going at very high speeds can still cause a lot of damage it concludes by saying that there are ways to prevent space junk by countries working together to come up with a soluting to this problem
24531,9,1,the author first defines what satelittes and space crafts are and why they are launched into space then explains how the microdebri effect them the author backs it up with detail and specific information and findings
24532,9,1,the organize them in a way that grabs the authors attention each time about each subjest of space junk it is in order by the least dangerous to the most dangerous thing just by the last title little bits but a big deal
24533,9,1,the author first starts off by telling what the problem is the problem is space junk the author explains exactly what this 'junk' is the author then gives a history of space exploration i think that is important because it shows that after 50 years there could be a lot of junk built up the important thing is they realize its a problem that is explained in the last section they're trying to find ways to solve this problem
24534,9,2,the author organizes the article by telling what space junk is first by doing that you know what it is and how it got up there in the first place after that they tell you about the crash course in that it tells you how and why the space junk crashes into one another then after they tell you about that they tell you how unsafe little bits are within that it tells you how even the smallest thing can cause a big problem out in space
24535,9,1,the author organizes this article by title names for each topic in the article to break down each topic so it is easier to read
24536,9,2,he organizes it into paragraphs with headings of different topics like what is space junk this paragraph talks about the history of when it started with launching satellites into space crash course this paragraph talks about how satellites haved crash in space little bits but a big deal this talks about how little thing that get lost in space like tools from astronauts get lost in space and which can cause a lot of damage
24537,9,1,the author starts his article with a joke then it turns to serious the author moves to the dates to satellite crashes and other dates of space on the last section the author talks about how space junk is dangerous and why we need to stop sending excess substances into outerspace
24538,9,2,he organizes it in different catogories suck as what space junk is what happens when stuff crashes and how it affects and how tose peices may be small but they can still affect in a huge way
24539,9,1,the author begins the article with strange sentences to gain the attention of the reader then the author begins inform the reader of the dangers of debris in space first by giving a brief history of space exploration the article is then divided into sections which talk about different types of debris such as satellites and small bits of space trash in each section the author describes the danger of each the article ends by the author describing efforts being made by nasa and the european space agency to maintain catalouges of space debris and to help reduce space debris
24540,9,0,people think that space is junk and noone like this earth
24541,9,0,the author organizes the imformation in this text in a chronological order the author goes from telling about the history of the great invasion to the present and how the debri from even way back then could be effecting astronauts and satelittes of today
24542,9,0,scitentists are hard pressed for an easy soulution to the problem of space junk and both national aeronautics and space agency nasa

24545,9,2,the author organizes this article by beginning with a attention getter such as 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor ' then moves onto explaining in the first part of the body what exactly space junk is and how it can affect us an example would be 'what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired ' of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high tech junk circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit the second part of the body it is described that if a satellite is malfunctioning it has the risk of colliding with another satellite from paragraph six it explains that two communication satellites one american and one russian both traveling more than 20 000 mph crashed into each other 491 mi above the earth the main purpose of the next and final part of this author's article is tiny bits of space debris and how it can be a serious problem tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts here is an example form paragraph nine that supports this statement 'if you find that hard to believe compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall ' all in all the author explains in paragraph eleven that the problem still persists and that the amount of space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is rising
24546,9,2,the article is a well organized piece it starts out with grabbing the attention of the reader and then presents the problem that 'space junk' is a serious matter that needs to be brought to more people's attention it then goes in to defining what 'space junk' is as well as the 'great space invasion ' in the third section it gives examples of how it is harmful to our planet and what really goes on when we send satellites in to outer space finally in the last section it states that they are again a serious problem and reitterates everything that the article is about it also presents a solution

24605,9,2,the author puts orbiting junk in to sections to show what is space junk talking about what it is how it comes bout what the out come is crash course talks about how space junk may interfer with spacecrafts and other object litlle bits but big deal talks about how it does cause a problem for the arstronauts and spacecraft how tiny debris can be a big deal and cause a mission to fail
24606,9,0,the author organize the article by putting things in order as he know
24607,9,2,the author organizes the article by breaking down the introduction and three other paragraphs into a section those sections are their own topic and are titled with bolded letters to state that you are about to read a new important sections about orbiting junk
24608,9,1,the author organized the article from the history of space junk is really dangerous the next is on how the space junk can crash into anything and anyone the next one after that is little bits can distoy anything
24609,9,2,first the author starts with an introduction to get your attention the author then gives a breif history on 'space junk' the author then talks about satellites and how they can become dead and just float freely in space the author finishes with telling the reader about objects in space can be very small but still cause massive amounts of damage
24610,9,1,the authors article is organized in topic order
24611,9,1,the author first gets the readers attention then tells them the problem and what it is they should do about it warning us that orbiting junk is dangerous
24612,9,1,he first tells us that it is a problem then tells us what space junk is then tells us what happens when they collide then tells us why it is dangerous
24613,9,1,the author organizes this article by putting headings on each subject to tell you what it is going to be about the headings are also in a bigger font and bolded
24614,9,1,the author organize the article by introducing firstwhat space junk is it tells thats space junk is space trash
24615,9,2,the author organizes the article by starting off with a very clear introduction that captures the reader's attention in the body of the article the author explains what space junk is how it got into space and why the junk stays in space then the author gives an account of what happened when two satellites crashed into each other and produces hundreds of smaller satellites after that the reader is informed of how dangerous microfragments of space junk really are and how different space agencies such as nasa are dealing with the issue in the article's conclusion the author shares with the reader that the amount of space trash is increasing rapidly and that space agencies hope to work alongside nations and corporations to stop space pollution
24616,9,1,the author starts off telling you what space junk is space junk is the unused or broken satellites in space and other smaller things then the author tells you about dead satellites running the risk of colliding with each other dead satellites colliding has happened before lastly the author talks about how little bits of satellite pieces are a big deal smaller satellite pieces go faster and therefor can crash into other satellites and destroy them very easily she organizes her article by order of importance
24617,9,1,the author organizes the article in some what of a chart telling what space junk is and then the course that it is on and last but not least what little bits but big deals like what would happen if this little piece of space junk came flying at us and then tore a huge hole in the side of our space craft
24618,9,1,in this article the author origanizes it by indroducing an important topic with something catchy that will pull the reader in his sentence that states 'look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor it's a tool bag ' introduces the paragraph well by catching the readers attention with a phrase that you have heard before only with different word then the author after he has you attention goes into statitics which makes you believe that the author knows what he or she is talking about it gives a certain creditiblity he aslo compares it to things that make it easy to relate to however he sticks to getting the point across
24619,9,2,he breaks it down into different topics the first main section titled 'what is space junk ' is about the cluttered solar system because of satellite debris 'crash course' is about satellites crashing into each other and the debris that it can cause 'little bits but a big deal' is about how tiny bits of debris may seem harmless but they can still do damage
24620,9,0,by placing examples of the things that have been lost at space and what they some timew do like two bad satalites crashing into each other then going to what needs to happen
24621,9,0,the author first states his opinion and the reasons behind it then they give the reader some details ad facts to back up his observation they gave examples of past experiences involving cluttered space the rest of the article is information and examples surrounding the problem
24622,9,1,the author organizes the article to show what space junk is and the dangers of it
24623,9,1,he want to anyone knows about the space junk this is a first artificial satellite og the u s the author organize the article first he explain what is a junk and what function have how many kinds of junk we have on the space and he said too the variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and the satellites have been sent beyond earth's atmosphere he talk about the dead satellites run the risk of colling with each other and any objects released in to space become free orbiting satellites and how the scientists are hard pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk
24624,9,0,yet the problem is certain to persist
24625,9,0,the author organizes the article in a logical order he grabs your attention and then tells you the facts he then tells history and why space debris is a problem
24626,9,1,the author organizes the articles by starting off with a little humor then going into details such as explaing what 'space junk' is and going into details about it his tone changes to inform the readers on how important and dangerous this is
24627,9,2,the author organizes the article by seperating it and breaking it into sections like 'orbiting junk' talks explains what space junk is then tells the reader it is a great concern to the government of space agencies around the globe then there's 'what is space junk ' which explains whats happen over the past 52 years then 'crash course' tells the reader about the risk of colliding satellites with eachother then the reader goes to 'little bits but a big deal' which explains how bits of space debris present a very serious problem how tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the carefully designed spacecraft the articel being organized helps the reader stay interested and understand better
24628,9,0,organizes it good
24629,9,2,the author categorizes this article for example he puts information about space junk in 'what is space junk'
24630,9,1,the author of this article organizes this article like a professional informative article he includes an attention getting introduction along with informative sections teeming with facts he also uses subtitles in the article to organize details and information
24631,9,2,the author organized this article by making every section have a diferent topic for example he she had titles sucha as ' what is sapce junk crach course little bits but a big deal'
24632,9,2,the author starts off with an exciting introduction that very much grabbed my attention next he or she defines space junk third the author discusses how satellites collide with each other lastly he or she talks about small issues that are a big deal
24633,9,1,the author explains about space junk and tells what it is and what it does also it explains why it's harmful and dangerous the crash cource explains what happens when there is to much junk so that is how the artlicle is explained
24634,9,2,the author organizes the reading into an easy to read article he starts off with grabbing the readers attention he then continues on with giving facts and statements about the space junk and how it got into orbit around the earth the article is finished with connecting the reader with the world and giving the reader the ability to help out
24635,9,1,he makes it organized by telling the reader information they will need to read the next section
24636,9,2,the author organizes the article by topic in the first section 'what is space junk ' the author basically explains what space junk is and gives a few examples of space junk the author talks about satellite crashes and the results of them in the second section in the last section the author explains how even though some debris is very small it still poses a huge problem
24637,9,1,the author organizes this article with everything going in order of how the space stuff got there it talks about how it is bad for space and it sholdn't be there then it finishes with talking about how everything above it all affects us
24638,9,0,the author supporting details uses 'what is space junk' and others to describe what he or she is talking about
24639,9,1,the author organizes the article by the importance of the text for one the first paragraph what is space junk is a pretty serious matter then after that text is still important but the way the article is set up is like the paragraphs are organized based on the importance of the information in them
24640,9,1,the author orginizes the article by titles so that the reader could look for specifice information on the subject of there choice
24641,9,1,he asks questions in the beginning he goes into a history lesson and then he closes with a thought that there needs to be a solution
24642,9,1,he starts with the begining middle and to end duh
24643,9,1,the author begins with an exclamation to grab attention of the reader he then begins telling the reader about microdebris and that it is becoming a very serious hazard he then tells the reader about small objects the size of baseballs and smaller being left in space and how much damage they can cause to a well crafted spacecraft getting hit by a baseball sized object he also gives a sandblaster example how sand doesnt hurt if they wind blows it but they also use sand to remove paint with a sandblaster showing the power change for the same object just different speeds
24644,9,2,to organize the article the author breaks up the information into different categories they have the introduction then they have a section about space junk after that there is a section about how the satelites crash and lastly there is a section about how much of an impact the space junk has on people in space and on earth
24645,9,0,the author organizes the article by matter of importence
24646,9,1,the article has different segments in it with different information all the articles talk about microdebris so the whole article is talking about the samething in different segments
24647,9,1,the author organizes the article in a fair manner he explains how the 'space junk' is really a serious matter he states how some people might not care about this space junk but they're are a great amount of people who care about what is exposed to outside of the earth not only is that junk but it is things to give us and nasa information it also gives a good example of how the junk is released which they created a paragraph 'crash course' the paragraph 'little bits but a big deal' also explains how people don care about this junk
24648,9,1,the author organizes the article by giving each new subject a title
24649,9,2,the author organizes the article by the different topics she wants to cover the first topic is all about space junk while the second is all about the crash course and the third is about little the space trash
24650,9,2,he starts out telling what space junk is then he goes and tells how satellites crash and make tiny debris after that he talks about how the little debris can be a bid deal he organizes it all by using the headings what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
24651,9,2,the author organizes this article in a particular order that it all ties together he or she begins with a creative introduction to engage the reader then proceeds to lead right into the main idea space junk he mentions the objects that have been sent into eath's atmosphere and branches off the problem of satellites and what happens when it malfunctions he concludes this with the fact that this object will become space junk this leads into the next paragraph where he explains problems that 'dead' satellites cause and so on the author continues to tie eveything together in this particular order throughout the entire passage
24652,9,1,he arranges the article into seperate topics by title the main subject of the sections are used in the title to give the reader an idea of what the purpose of that section is he does not clutter alot of different topics together yet he organizes them to help understand how 'space junk' poses a problem to spaceships and satellites
24653,9,1,the author organizes this article by grouping different information together under 'what is space junk ' an explanation is given of what it is under 'crash course' the author talks about examples of when space debris has become a problem to space exploration
24654,9,2,the author of the article organizes the writing in a logical way they first describe what space junk is in 'what is space junk ' they do this by giving a short history on the space invasion and a short explanation on how a satellite can 'die' and hurtle uncontrolably through space then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section 'crash course' they explain how satelittes can collide and create massive amounts of microdebris that continue to orbit the earth at incredible speeds they also show how some astronauts can make mistakes such as losing the grip on their tool bag and causing the bag to begin orbiting the earth in the final section 'little bits big deal' the author shows how dangerous this debris can be if it is traveling at a high rate of speed the author provides startling evidence that microdebris can puch holes in spacecraft to inform the reader on the dangers of space junk
24655,9,1,the author divides the article into different sections to make it easier to read and to organize the topics
24656,9,1,the author starts their introduction by making a fun eye catching statement then they put in a historical time in their article the author decided to divide the article into sections to make it easier and more organized to undertstand
24657,9,0,the author organize this
24658,9,1,the author organizes the article by breaking up the information into seperate headings and paragraphs this helps myself and other readers to understand the information better without getting bored
24659,9,2,the author organizes the artical from history to present he she lists things for the matters they are in like say crash course they explain that the satilites crash from the course they are on then say what is space junk they tell you what space junk is and how it happend way back when the person lets you know what the sections are about
24660,9,1,the author supports this article by giving a good and stronge reason and in diffrent areas to help and break down the problem in a simple way such as puting it in diffrent forms of phragraphs so that the read can better understand what the author is tring to tell the readers reading this although it is very long it toke a very complicated matter and put it into a simple form fo readers that are at a young age to fully understane the importance in space junk
24661,9,1,it is organized into sections on the junk in outer space they are telling you that it can be a very dangerous matter each section is about different things space trash is still increasing these days without anyone at the controls dead satellites could collide with each other
24662,9,0,the author does ok the author's reference to the tool bag in the first paragraph isn't talked about again untill about two paragraphs later i as the reader had no clue what the author meant by tool bag untill the end of the second topic
24663,9,2,the author of this article starts with an introduction that states once clear space is 'now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions ' the author then goes on to explain precisely what space junk is and how it has formed in the seciton entitled 'what is space junk ' the next section entitled 'crash course' goes on to explain the harm that space debris can cause to spacecraft 'little bits but a big deal' concludes the article by telling why we should care about space debris the section also includes techniques that engineers are using to try and minimize damage done by the debris
24664,9,0,he explains it when gives examples of things that have gotten lose in space
24665,9,2,the author organizes the article from most important to the least important the author goes form 'what is space junk' to 'crash course' and finally to 'little bits but a big deal' he goes this way because to understand what the reader is talking about you must first understand what space junk is and to understand why is it important you have to know how dangerous space junk is by knowing that the space junk has crashed into and destroyed many spaceships
24666,9,0,howdoestheauthororganizethearticale supportyourresponsewith detailsfromthearticlepleasetypeyouranswerintheboxbelow
24667,9,1,the author organizes the article in different ways such as what is space junk talks about all of the different things that do get sent out and lost or 'dies' crash course talks about how the dead satellites run into eachother also little bits but its a big deal explains that even though they can be little bitty pieces of the 'space junk' they do matter
24668,9,1,the author organizes the article by talking about the junk that is orbiting space now then explaning space junk to people who dont know what it is and then after that explaining the harm and or problems that the junk could have on earth and even the people who travel out to space
24669,9,0,the author organized this article with a attention getter and than some starlting facts after the fact you have been pulled in than the author gives some really startling facts that are really interesting the author informs you how far away the junk is and how fast it can come back to earth and do some serious damage
24670,9,2,the author organizes the article much like one would see in a magazine it includes headings with short paragraghes under them the point of the article is made very clear in a short amount of space with many imperative facts and details they make it interesting by giving each heading an apealing name such as 'crash course ' and 'little bits but a big deal '
24671,9,1,the author breaks up the artical into three different parts he does that so that you can understand what the artical is talking about if he mixed it all into one many people would be very confused so he simplifies it so that the already hard topic he is bringing forward is much easier to understand by the people reading the aritical
24672,9,2,the author organizes the article as a cause and effect article the author first talks about satellites being launched into orbit 'over the past 52 years a variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and satellites have been sent beyond earth's atmosphere ' then describes how these satellites can malfunction or become damaged then the author descirbes how these malfunctioned and damaged satellites can collide and produce space junk 'now instead of two disabled satellites there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space '
24673,9,1,he gets the tittle on what he want to wright about then he goes and tittles the story haedings
24674,9,1,i would say that the author organized this passage in a way of most important and which came first in the passage 'what is space junk' it talks about how satelites began and the last passage 'little bits but a big deal'
24675,9,1,the author organizes this article great he drew me in by the introdtuction the author also had very good detail on space junk and he had had an excellent body the author really did a great job on organizing his article
24676,9,0,the author organizes this article in a very unique way in the introduction he grabs your attention by stating 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor ' by saying that the author has automatically grabbed your attention and you are now hooked in on reading the article then the author writes a series of important facts that can be useful for you to know
24677,9,0,by puting the stories in the right order on how it would happen first
24678,9,1,he organizes the article with telling us what spacejunk is what it does and how its dangerous
24679,9,0,he gives lots of information throughout the article
24680,9,1,the author organizes the article by building up information he starts off with how it all started by explaining what space junk is then he tells us how sattelites will eventually crash into each other finally he axplains how the results of those crashes will create debris that can cause a big problem with the earth
24681,9,2,the author organizes this article in three different sections they start off by explaining what they are going to be talking about space junk then they go on to give one way that space junk is effective and what it does to our outer space finally the author tells us about how even though space junk is very small and not many know about it or realize it is very effective
24682,9,1,the author organizes this article by events that lead up to what his main topic is he starts with the first artificial satellite and end with all the space trash in outer space now
24683,9,2,the author organizes the article by first grabbing our attention in an artful playful manner lines 1 2 the author then goes on to explain how space junk is created although in a much more serious manner once the reader is clear on the causes of 'space junk' the author goes in depth on what happens to these unwanted fragments in the way of collissions and free orbiting satellites eventually the author concludes how these little pieces of 'space trash' become dangerous to future foreys into the field of space travel and advises that we seek a 'viable sollution'
24684,9,1,the author explains a story first for an example then he goes to his point he tells wat space junk is then he tells why it is harfull even if we think it is not he does this when he talks about stuff hitting each other in there orbit and when a simple toolbag could cause a problem
24685,9,0,first the author tills you what the article is all about then the author tills you the dangers of it
24686,9,1,the author starts out interseting then they give us statistics about what has happened in the past years around the sixth paragraph they give us examples by the eighth and ninth paragraphs they are talking about the bag which was mentioned in the introduction the conclusion of this passage is saying that they hope to one day come up with a sollution to this
24687,9,2,the just use thing they know and but things where they belong like 'what is space junk' it explains to you what it is tells you everything they know baout the topic writen about the statements they always look to make sure the things they have out in the passage makes sence with the topic it is under they never put things that makes no sence in a passage like if they but and there was a bananas are monkey favorite food in there under 'what is space junk' it just dosent fit they only use things that are clear and you help you to understand about the thing they are writing about
24688,9,1,it begins with a humorous statement meant to entertain the reader and lead him or her inot the next paragraph which tells the reader what the passage is going to be about the next heading defines the subject and how it gets there the next two paragraphs give specific examples of encounters with the subject then it explains why we should care about this subject
24689,9,0,because it gives you a lead in what happenend or what it that
24690,9,2,the auther sets up the article in sections from describing what space junk is and how harmful it can be
24691,9,1,in sections so if you are looking for a specific answer to a question you just look under the topic it may be under
24692,9,2,the article is organized by first giving a history about space exploration an example being when the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite and how the united states followed along behind them next you are told about how things in an uncontrolled orbit collide with each other functioning satellites and even space ships in the last section 'little bits but a big deal' you are informed that even though the space debris is small is can be dangerous for example even an object small than a baseball traveling at high speeds can cause large amounts of damage to satellites and space crafts the overall organization of this starts off to tell you a history give you examples and detail problems that 'space junk' can cause
24693,9,1,he organize it in diffrent topics in the story like one topic is 'orbiting junk' and the next one is 'what space is' so he switchis off on diffrent topics witch i think keeps you more intested in the story cause theres diffrent topics
24694,9,0,by telling what each topic is talking about and how those topics explain all the things about space
24695,9,0,the author believes that there needs to be less material in space eventualy they will all break down and fall into the earths atmosphere poluting it
24696,9,1,he begins with shocking statments to get the reader interested then he begins with the history behind all spacecrafts and how they were created and what purpose they were used for
24697,9,2,the article starts off with a childish realization through a telescope then it gives a brief history of space exploration and a couple incidents of space debris including the 2009 satellite crash and the toolbag it then comes out and tells you how big of a problem things from a toolbag to destroyed satellites by telling you about a sandblaster and how it works and using it as a larger scale for objects in orbit
24698,9,0,he tells people how their is junk from the satelites hitting each other and that their is junk every where in the orbits
24699,9,2,the author organizes the article by sepreating the article into sections the first section is called orbiting junk the second is called what is space junk the third is called crash course the fourth is called little bits but a big deal they break up these articles to seperate the different points of the article so its not all in one combination
24700,9,0,he organizes the article by what happened in the past first and then talks about what is going to happened or what could happen
24701,9,1,the author organized his writing by sectioning his writing off
24702,9,2,he starts out as describing space junk than he goes to crash course and tells the reader if something extremely bad happens this is the approch than last he talks about space trash he describes the outter space with all of the trash floating around in it from previous astronotes he goes into great detail about everything that he talks about but also its not drawn out to where you fall asleep reading it the author did a really good job of writing this article
24703,9,1,the author organizes the article by seperating the facts of everything the facts that he talked about include the clutter in space and when they launched the first artificial satellite and space junk got started and who is going to take responsibility for the space trash
24704,9,2,the author organized the article with an introduction to the subject of the articles comes first then the author gives background information about the subject by talking about space programs and how space debris is created it also presents some of the problems caused by space junk the second to last section talks about the details of how some other forms of space junk occur as well as how hard it is to prevent space junk from occuring the final paragraph explains how space junk can damage ships and how ships cannot avoid it easily the article ends with a call to corporations to help solve the problem of space junk
24705,9,2,the first paragraph is to get the readers attention and make them want to read the story then the tone changes in the section 'what is space junk ' and because more serious this section tells the reader what space junk is and how it got to be where it it the next section is called 'crash course' and it tells about what happens when two pieces of space junk collide and it gives example of this happening in february 2009 with two communication satellites section 'little bits but a big deal' is the last section and it tells about how space junk is harmful and why this is such a serious matter the section discusses how harmful little pices of junk can be for astronauts and our space crafts that we send into space the last paragraph tells about how spacejunk is increasing and is still a problem all nations are trying to work together to find a solution to the problem
24706,9,0,the author organizes the article by the development of space technology and the dates in which the statistics of space junk staelites telescopes and ect are reconized
24707,9,1,the author uses titles before it opens up new information for example one of the titles is orbiting junk after that the author explains with information
24708,9,1,the author first used a hook to catch the reader's attention by using a question then he explained what space junk was how satellites can crash into each other how space debris is a big deal how space debris is harmful and how they are trying to come up with a solution for it
24709,9,1,the author organizes the article by giving you information about the junk and a time when an actual space invasion occured then the article goes into how people might think its not a big deal but it is
24710,9,2,the author organized the article by separating information into several different sections first he she explained what space debris is in 'what is space junk ' secondly he she used an example of the negative effects that space debris has caused to space in ' crash course' then finally they use information from space agencies around the world to show the effects on the countries on earth in 'little bits but a big deal'
24711,9,0,it was not organized well
24712,9,1,my opinion of this article is that it is well organized and well written why i say that is because it grabbed my atttention expecially in the introduction as i followed along and continued to read the facts and concerns of this article made me want to read it
24713,9,1,the author oraginizes the article in varies ways he first gets our attention by using questions and loud statements to get our attnetion then he shows us the harm in space junk and gives us facts about the way we are taking care of the atmosphere then he leads us to the end where he tells us what we can do to avooid harmful situations and gives us tips on how to improve our wasteful tendencies
24714,9,1,the author organizes the article by first informing the reader about the topic of space junk history is used to give an accurate example of space junk after some background information is given the author uses statistics and facts to show the reader how dangerous space junk can be lastly the author ties up the last paragraph emphasizing the damage space junk can do and what a threat it can be in the future the author end the article with a concerned tone and uses the organization of the article to fully inform the reader
24715,9,2,the other orginizes this article by starting off with a introduction that gets you attention then is gives a brief history entitled 'what is space junk ' after that secton it moves onto a more recent accident with space junk and finishes the article off with the dangers of the little debri
24716,9,2,the author of 'orbiting junk' organizes his article into several subtopics so that the reader can clearly see the change of subjects in the article making it easier to read the subtopic 'what is space junk' talks about and defines what space junk really is while 'little bits but a big deal' talks about the relavence of space junk and its effect on space travel
24717,9,1,he grabs your attention with a little action then he explains what space junk is and it can damage space things how little things make a big deal
24718,9,2,the author organizes the article in such a way the reader can follow along easily without much confusion before he she goes on to inform you about the trouble space junk is causing they inform you what space junk is then they inform you of some of the things that are happening because of space junk as in satellites crashing together and they conclude by telling how big of a problem space junk has been and will be because 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing '
24719,9,1,the author organizes it into different subsections based of what the subject of the section is
24720,9,2,first the author talks about space junk and tells wehen the first artificial satellite was launched then the author talks about how this ''space junk'' is currently of great concern to the government agencies
24721,9,1,the author puts this article in a weird way he or she starts by a eye catching introduction and then goes to a boring history lesson about satelittes and space junk then the author takes us into another exciting paragraph about satelittes crashing into each other and it just goes on and on until the article is over but somehow at the end of it all i still wanted to know more
24722,9,2,at first the author uses a suprising statement to grab the readers attention and bring them into the article itself next the author discusses the seriousness of space junk circling our planet the author than defines what space junk is and than gives a brief history on where space junk came from the author than talks about the dangers of space junk colliding with other objects such as functional sattalites and human being who are workign outside of their spacecraft finally the author talks about how dangerous even the smallest pieces of space debris can be extremely harmful and how scientists and entire nation are working together to solve the problem of 'space junk'
24723,9,1,the author organizes the article but making side headings of the more important things about space and space junk and orginizing information to go into those areas
24724,9,2,the organization of the article is information in each section while collectively the sections map out a situation that could cause 'space junk ' the introduction which obviously introduces the topic and provides a summary of the sections yet to come is followed by 'what is space junk' immediately afterword before defining space junk a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced the idea of an object malfunctioning is given and an actual example of the space junk causing problems is conceived while still keeping a linear outline of the mostly informative article following the history of the satellites in space and their possible malfunctioning 'crash course' provides an example from february 2009 shows how two satellites could collide and created hundreds of pieces of smaller debris which is elaborated in the final section 'little bits but a big deal' the small pieces of debris or the example given in 'crash course' of a tool bag are shown to be problematic and with both facts and descripitive paragraphs the informative article becomes somewhat of a story by saying 'tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft ' this section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful the organization of the article is both informative in some paragraphs but simultaneously follows a linear yet non descript situational plot
24725,9,1,the author organizes the artical but putting stictics in first before try to persuade the readres what really happen i think it is really good becuase people need to know the true facts
24726,9,2,the author seperates the article into different sections that have information that goes along with cooresponding information in each of the sections for example in the section crash course there is a detailed explanation of how two satellites collided in 2009 in the section it first tells the reader what could possibly happen and then gives an example or a possible scenario in another example the author titles a section 'what is space junk ' the author tells of how 52 years of space exploration has polluted the space just outside earth's atmosphere then the author describes what the kinds of 'junk' are found in space from these previous space missions
24727,9,1,the author organized this to where he could draw attention to the passage starting with the rehtorical questions then describing space junk telling the reader how it got there and what peoples reaction is to the space junk
24728,9,2,the author seems to organize the article with a clearly defined introduction that is titled 'orbiting junk' that is used to introduce the subject the author then uses two sections to explain what 'space junk' is and why it is such a big danger he then proceeds to have a conclusion section titled 'little bits but a big deal' which explains why such small pieces of debris can prove to be very harmful
24729,9,2,the introduction of this article grabs your attention and makes you want to read more about it 'what is space junk ' describes the events that have occured overtime with the mircodebris and satelliates in space 'crash course' tells about how two satellites collided into each other in an orbit around the earth's orbit it also tells that not only is it spectacular crashes that create this debris it's any object 'little bits but a big deal' tell about how much people truly care about what's going on in space it also tells about how dangerous microdebris can be if not avoided
24730,9,1,the author begins the article with fun interesting words that grab the reader and then he jumps into the seriuous matter of the story
24731,9,1,the author organizes the article in a way were the reader first recieves information on what space junk really is then the harmful consequences earth could face when two satellites do collide
24732,9,1,the author organizes the article by putting the same subjects together into paragraphs and different topics in different paragraphs
24733,9,0,from fun news to really bad information about today outter space
24734,9,2,the author starts off the passage with a comical line 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor it's a tool bag ' from their the author begins explaining the term 'space junk' and some space travel history as to how space debris came to be further on the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be he provides an exapmle of when two satellites one russian and one american collided in space and created hundreds of pieces that now helplessly oribit earth then he makes a comparison with how dangerous and affective sand can be when shot at such a fast rate he does this to prove that even the smallest fo space junk can pose a threat to space ships entering space
24735,9,1,he first explains what is beyond the earth's atmospere and how it got there then explains that the things that are beyond the earth's atmospere do break and become an issue after that he explains how they have a big effect on things
24736,9,1,he organizes it by getting the readers attention by starting it with a shocking sentence then he casually starts explaining how dangerous space junk really is
24737,9,2,the author does an excellent job at ordering the information of this article they begin with an attention getter in the opening paragraph to grab the reader's attention 'grab your telescope look up in the sky ' then move into describing the topic of their article space junk more clearly 'the disabled object becomes a piece of high tech junk ' the following paragraphs explain how space junk comes to be 'with no one at the controls dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other' and the article closes with the dangers of space junk 'those bits of space debris present a very serious problem '
24738,9,2,the author of 'orbiting junk' organizes the article into four sections the introduction brings up the idea of space junk and explains that it is causing a global governmental concern the author goes on to explain what space junk is and transitions into why it is a problem in the next two paragraphs finally the author wants to raise awareness that the volume of space trash is in fact increasing and that it is difficult to avoid
24739,9,1,they organize it by using ancadotes as the introductions then breaking down the article into sections that discuss the different topics
24740,9,0,to make it sound like its a big deal that space junk is a big problem so he gets peoples attention
24741,9,0,the author organizes the article by lining up the statistics well and providing alot of useful information in the article the reader is very educated by the end of the article
24742,9,2,the author organizes the article in multiple sections they have a section titled 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal'
24743,9,2,the author seperates the article into different parts there are four main parts there are three main parts each with a different topic on space junk in the first the author uses a humerous appraoch like 'it's a tool bag ' but then moves to a more serious tone the author explains that it is a serious issue the author presents the dangers and problems in the later sections finally at the end he says how many nations contribute to the problem and it must be solved so first he gets your attention then the next section explains what it is and the last two present the issues and the seriousness of it while concluding the paper
24744,9,0,by giving insight on the problem then giving solutions
24745,9,1,he talks about the history of space and how we have satellites then talks about the importance of saellite debris and how it can be very dangerous
24746,9,0,the author starts out gentle and says the facts straight out the author starts to get very harsh and starts to state that this is a serious matter the organization of this artical not only helps keep a eye on it but it helps to tell us about this and what will happen to stuff in the atmosphere from going to gentle and easing us into the more painful facts was a great way to write this artical
24747,9,1,he starts of with a attention getter and goes into the seriousness of the essay then he explains how thesse things happen and shows just because they are small doesnt mean they are not effective
24748,9,0,he puts it impportanc
24749,9,2,the author organizes the article into several sections the intro 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' the first section defines 'space junk' for the reader section two explains how debris can be formed by colliding satellites and section three explains why space junk is a problem
25949,10,2,black black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog iknow this because in the resul ts black got the hottest
25950,10,1,white white because you wouldn't want the dog to ge t to hot
25951,10,2,white the color white will reflect the suns rays of f of it because in the lab the color white had the lowest tempeture and black absorbed the heat so it was hotter and if they had the doghouse pai nted black the dog would get to hot and die so white
25952,10,1,white this color will keep the dog house cooler ins ide because it doesn't heat up as fast the average time for the glass to heat up was 42 degrees in 10 minutes
25953,10,2,white i would use a light color like white in this case because if its 95 degrees outside and you have a black dog house the dog house is going to be hot like in the experiment they used they used a black lid because it would make the jar the hotest
25954,10,0,light gray the darker of color the the hoter it g ets
25955,10,1,light gray i think it will affect it by the doghou se atrackting heat and if neede they could paint it another color when it gets colder of warmer
25956,10,1,black the color would absorb more heat from the sun making it hotter in the doghouse
25957,10,1,light gray i chose light gray because i was thinking of temperatures of the seasons in summer the light gray will reflect some o f the heat while keeping it alittle warm inside in winter the ligh t gray will absorb alittle of the sun light making it alittle warm inside
25958,10,2,white it will kepp the dog house cool and not to ho t because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the w hite lid had an averge of 42 degrees there for if the dog house was pain ted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside
25959,10,2,black the black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside the average temperature with the black lid was 53 deg the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48 deg the average temp erature for the light gray was 45 deg and for the white it was 42 deg there is a 11 deg difference between the black and white colored lid so the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside
25960,10,0,white the color white will reflect the sunlight just like the white lid reflected the light from the lamp in the experiment
25961,10,1,white it would reflect a lot of the light and heat making it cooler inside the doghouse
25962,10,1,white it will give the dog more cool air because li ghter colors absorb cool air instead of heat
25963,10,1,black well the darker the lid is the more tempayure goes into the jar and the avarege of the black lid was 53 deg c
25964,10,0,white they would want to choose white for the summer because it wont attract alot of heat they would want to use black for the winter to attract more heat
25965,10,0,dark gray all choosable colors are waht you might call a 'double edged sword' because altough the dark colors will keep the dog warm in winter it'll make him to hot in summer and while the light col ors will keep him cool in summer they wont do much for him in winter
25966,10,1,black it will keep the inside of the dog house warm er
25967,10,1,light gray light gray is the best color to use because i tself is that dark of a color so the dog wont burn up darker color increa se in heat tempeture and not that light that the dog would be cold
25968,10,2,white brandi and jerry should use white paint becau se in the experiment the jar with the white lid increased the least in t emperature it increased 18 deg c while the black lid made the temperatu re increase 29 deg c therefore the white paint should be used so that the dog house doesn't overheat
25969,10,1,white the color white would affect the doghouse it so it may be cooler inside because of the lack in absorbing energy
25970,10,0,light gray on cold days the light gray absorbs the hotte r temp and on hot days it douse not absorb as much
25971,10,2,white the best color to paint the dog house would b e white white reflects more light than black this would keep the inside temperature of the dog house cooler than it would if the dog house were painted black in the experiment the white lid was at an average of 11 deg c cooler than the jar with the black lid therefore the white would be the bes t color to paint the dog house
25972,10,1,light gray the doghouse should be light gray because it does not absorb to much heat or to little heat so the dog won't be to hot or to cold it will be just right
25973,10,2,white if they colored the doghouse white then it wi ll be cool inside and not so hot like it would be if it was black because when the jar lid was black the inside of the jar was 53 deg c an d when it was white the inside of the jar was 42 deg c
25974,10,1,dark gray the air inside will be hotter than it would b e with the light gray and white as the roof color so the dog can stay war m at night but it also be colder than if the black was the roof color so the dog won't get too hot during the day
25975,10,1,white the color might affect the dog house just a l ittle bit because the white color had the lowest temp compared to the b lack wich its average was 53 thats a n 11 deg c diferanc an the dark grey was a n 6 deg c differance also the light gray was a n 3 deg c differance
25976,10,2,black it will effect the dog house by it being more hot cause on the chart it showed black was the hottest
25977,10,2,light gray the light gray color would reflect some of th e light energy but also absorb a little so the doghouse would not get to o hot or cold the white color had an average of 42 deg c after 10 minut es which might be too cold the dark gray had an average of 48 deg c w hich might be too hot
25978,10,0,black no color will affect the doghouse
25979,10,1,dark gray dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use because it would not be too hot inside if you were to do black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat in every trial for dark gray it created 48 deg c this seems like a pretty good temperature for a dog house
25980,10,1,black black is my choice because if it kept the jar warm for ten minutes then black would be able to keep a doghouse warm for longer
25981,10,0,black i chose black because the sun wont reflect th e color black and it wont effect inside the dog house
25982,10,1,white it will make the dog house cooler
25983,10,0,black because it's so string
25984,10,1,white it should be white the white lid average was 42 deg c and it was the lowest average of temperature for the experimen t
25985,10,1,white the white color reflected the most thermal en ergy and will keep the dog cool
25986,10,1,dark gray it will make it warmer than a light grey or w hite doghouse but cooler than a black doghouse this is better because d ogs generally use a doghouse to hide from the rain in winter and my colo r will keep it warmer however they are also used in summer and as such should not be black as that would make it unusable during summer
25987,10,1,black the black doghouse would keep you warmer in t he winter but it would be really hot in the summer
25988,10,1,white the color will keep the dog house cool on the inside so on hot summer days the dogs can be nice and cool
25989,10,2,black black paint would affect the doghouse by making it the warmest because according to the data black had the highest average of temperature which was 53 deg c which is warmer than the other 3 tested colors so to me i think black would be the best color
25990,10,0,light gray i chose light gray becasue it won't make the dog feel sad
25991,10,2,light gray the light gray color would keep the doghouse mild and warm on average the light gray colored lid went from 24 deg c to 42 deg c a difference of 21 deg c compared to the black color ed lid which went from 24 deg c to 53 deg c a difference of 29 deg c which is too hot or the white colored lid which went from 24 deg c to 4 2 deg c a difference of 18 deg c therefore a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse
25992,10,2,white white will keep the dog house nice and cool s ince according to there data the white lid kept the air in the jar cooles t
25993,10,2,black the black one will have a good heat for the d og because in the trial the black lid was average was 53 deg c
25994,10,1,white the color of the dog house will affect the te mperature of the inside of the dog house the color white will keep the t emerature lower than the other colors
25995,10,2,light gray i think white would be the best color for the doghouse becuase according to the experiment it was the coldest so in th e summer when it is hot outside the doghouse will not be to hot
25996,10,1,white brandi and jerry should paint their doghouse white because the color absorbs less heat so it will keep it cool and no t too hot for the doggy
25997,10,1,light gray it wont be to hot on sunny days and it wont be to cold on cloudy days
25998,10,2,white white would be the best color for the doghous e because it would keep the dog cooler white would absorb less solar and thermal energy therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse in the experiment the air temperature in the jar with the white lid aver aged 42 deg c while the black lid jar averaged 53 deg c the light g ray lid produced and air temperature of 45 deg c and the dark gray lid made the air temperature in the jar 48 deg c
25999,10,2,black black will make the dog house warmer inside b ecause darker colors absorb more energy and in air temperature the average temp for black was 53 deg while the average for white was 42 deg every starting temperature started at 24 deg therfore black would be the best color to choose for the dog house
26000,10,2,black black will be the based color for the dog hou es because in the chart lid color vs air temperture inside glass ja r black hade 54 in trial 1and52 in trial 2 and 53 in trail 3 dark gr ay light gyay and white where in the low to high 40's black will keep the dog house warm or cool when needed
26001,10,1,light gray the color light gray will affect the inside o f the dog house because it will get warm but not too hot because if you h ave a dog house that is way to hot the dog might die and since dog houses are always out in the sun the dog house will become extremely hot becaus e in the experiment the lid colors were only left under a lamp for about only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly
26002,10,2,white using white paint would be a great paint colo r for the doghouse because if its white it won't recieve that much sunlig ht and so it would be cooler if you look at the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45 deg c so white would be a great doghouse color
26003,10,1,white because white does not asborb as much energy so it would be cooler in the dog house
26004,10,2,black if brandi and jerry use black then the tempe rature will be warmer because it has the highest average temperature at 53 deg c if they use white then it will bne colder because the average when white was 42 deg c therefore the darker the doghouse the warmer i t will be because black was 11 deg c more than white
26005,10,1,white the white colored paint might make the inside o the dog house colder than out side on a hot day s ohe or she dont get way to hot
26006,10,1,light gray it would be a good color because it wouldnt b e too cold or too hot for the dog it would be just right
26007,10,2,white on a hot summer day it's easy for dogs to ge t overheated harming them and even killing them therefore white is the best color of paint to use because the air inside of it only increases b y 18 deg c after ten minutes of exposure to light and heat with black p aint it increases by 29 deg c which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health
26008,10,1,black because the doghouse will have a higher tempe rature because black absorbs more solar energy which will transform into thermal energy
26009,10,1,white i think the dog house should be white because it would keep the dog cool in the hot summer sun
26010,10,1,dark gray i chose a darker color like dark gray becasu e it will absorb more energy so the dog will hopefully much warmer in the winter however another reason i chose a dark gray instead of black is that it's also lighter in color compared to the black and will hopefully not get too hot in the summer
26011,10,0,white because the lighter the colors are the least heat energy is going to be absorbed
26012,10,2,light gray this would affect the doghouse because some l ight would be attracted to the house but not too much in their experimen t the light gray lids tempature was 45 deg this would be a good tempat ure for the dog house because in the summer the dog would have enough sha de so that it would not over heat but in the winter it would be warm eno ugh so that the dog would not be cold
26013,10,2,white white would keep the dog house cooler white does attract heat like the color black does when started at 24 deg c t he black lidded jar went up to an average of 53 deg c and the white lid ded jar which also started at 24 deg c only went up to an average of 42 deg c
26014,10,1,white i would use white paint because it would keep the doghouse cooler the doghouse will be cooler because the white paint will reflect the light and keep the doghouse cooler
26015,10,0,white it will afect the dog house by the temp in si de becaes the wight atracks less height
26016,10,1,white i chose white so it would be cool in the summ er
26017,10,2,white the best color to choose would be white becau se on average white had the lowest temperature of all the colors meeaning the inside of the doghouse would be cooler
26018,10,1,light gray light gray will be that color because you cou ld actually what color you are doing like when you paint that house and m aybe in the hot summer it wont be as hot if you paint the house bla ck
26019,10,2,white according to the experiment in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature the color white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler because white does not absorb lig ht
26020,10,1,white it well allow it to be coler then bieng hot
26021,10,2,white it might affect the temperature inside the do ghouse the data shows that the white lid has the lowest temperature the refore making it the best color to build the doghouse with
26022,10,1,white the color white would keep the dog house nice and cool inside in a hot summer day
26023,10,2,white the white paint should keep the inside temper ature of the doghouse cooler on a hot day than say black paint for examp le when comparing the average temperatures of all the lid colors the whi te lid kept the glass jar at a cooler temperature on average about 6 6 deg c cooler compared with the averages for the other lids so therefore white pa int is the better choice especially if you are looking to keep the insid e of the dog house cool for your dog on a hot day
26024,10,2,white in the expirement is stated that light er col ors are cooler than darker colors white is a very light color and light c olors don't absorb very much jeat so that means that the dog house won't be to hot
26025,10,2,light gray light gray would be best because it would absorb a little heat but not to much its average temperature was 45 degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog and in the summer it wo uld keep some of the heat out to keep the dog cool
26026,10,2,white if the dog house was white then when it is ho t the dog house would be cooler in the experiment it showed that the aver age tempature for the air was 43 celcius and all the other colors made it hotter like the black lid was 53 celcius
26027,10,2,white white will affect the dog house by making it cooler in the trials the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as
26028,10,1,dark gray dark grey because in the summer it wont be to hot and in the winter it wont be to cold
26029,10,2,black black would be a good color for the doghouse because black absorbs more heat black absorbs more heat because it is made of no color so it does not reflect any color of light which means it absorbs all the light in the experiment the black held an average of 53 deg c after being under the lamp for ten minutes the white lid had an average inside temperature of 42 deg c after beign under the lamp for ten minutes this is a difference of 11 deg c and is because white is made up of all the colors so it reflects all colors of light whereas the black relfects no light
26030,10,1,black black will affect the doghouse by makeing it hotter
26031,10,1,white the color i chose white would affect the te mperature because white absorbs less light making the doghouse not as hig h in temperature
26032,10,1,white the color of the dog house being white wil ca use the doghouse to stay cooler under sunlight this is beacuse the color white reflects the light away from the doghouse and the light will not be absorbed and turned into heat energy inside the doghouse
26033,10,2,black the black would be better to use for a paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer for the dog because in the experiment black made the jar the warmest
26034,10,1,black if you use the black then the doghouse would stay warm when ever the sun is out beacause the sun would get more light because it is darker
26035,10,1,dark gray brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse dark gray because the temperature according to their data is 48 deg c and it's perfect temperature not too cold nor hot and it barely changes temperature
26036,10,1,white the best color to choos for a dog house is wh it because it will keep the dog cooler and it will not get dehidrated th e dog will stay cooler inside the white doghouse
26037,10,1,white lighter color means cooler house
26038,10,2,black the best paint color for the house would be b lack because it would keep the dog warmer than other colors would the bl ack lid was 53 deg and all others were between 42 and 48 deg
26039,10,1,light gray this color would effect the doghouse because it would not be to hot or to cold
26040,10,1,white the color black tends to make things hotter a nd so if u used a white lid it would keep the tempature down if it was a sunny day for the black lid in the experiment the tempature increased t emp 54 and for the white it decresed temp 42 this is because the energ y is sucked out from the dark colors also dogs have alot of fur so it wo uld be best to have a cooler house
26041,10,2,white i would paint the dog house white the highes t temperature was 53 deg for the black lid which would cause the dog t o overheat while the lowest temperature was 42 deg for the white lid which would help the dog stay cool so i would paint my dog house white b ecause it is 11 deg cooler than painting it black
26042,10,1,white the white is better for the dog house because it wont get to hot inside and not to cold the hotest it would get in the house is 43 and the coldest it would get is 41
26043,10,0,dark gray i dont think it will efect it because it has the same number for each trial
26044,10,0,white i think white is the best coler out of all of the choses here because black is not esey to find in the dark but white is esey to find
26045,10,0,black it might blow it up
26046,10,1,white this color is the best becouse it wont atract so much heat energy and it would be fresh for the dog
26047,10,0,white it will start like geeting old and it wont look like new anymore it will have like scratches and mud and some black things
26048,10,2,white it would be much cooler inside the dog house because the color is light and reflects light better as it said in the r esults it had the lowest temperaute of 42 degree's celcius
26049,10,2,light gray i chose light gray as a good color for the do ghouse because the color does not absorb as much energy as a darker color such as black the color black which absorbs a lot of energy results in high temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as li ght gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much and causes lower temperatures based on the experiment the results show that that light g ray absorbs enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the jar at 45 deg c 8 deg c less than black which absorbs more heat and causes higher temperatures therefore a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray
26050,10,2,black the darker the doghouse color the greater th e increase in air temperature in the doghouse because the color absorbs m ore energy in the experiment the color black absorbed the most energy causing the inside of the jar to be the warmest the results for black we re 54 deg c 52 deg c 54 deg c and 53 deg c while all the other colors that were lighter absorbed less energy
26051,10,2,white i honestly would most likly choose white because all dark colors dark gray black light gray the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors white the sun reflects off of it so w hite would be best because it would keep the dog when its in the dog house white would keep it not so hot but it would still be hot on a hot day but thats my opinion and thats why i would pick white what would u pick
26052,10,1,black dark colors like black and dark gray absorb m ore energy and make it hotter than if i used white or light gray
26053,10,2,white it would keep the doghouse cooler because the white lid kept the jar the cooler than the other lids did
26054,10,2,black the doghouse will be warmer the doghouse wil l be warmer because in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest
26055,10,1,light gray they would want it between black and white so it will be warm and cool the tests showed that dark or light gray is ab out 46 5 deg c so it will be good for the dog
26056,10,1,dark gray i think dark gray because in the summer it wo nt get to hot but in the winter the color will still gather energy to kee p the dog house fairly warm
26057,10,2,white how the white paint will affect the dog house is it wont absorb so much heat so the dog wont be as hot if brandi an d jerry were to choose black paint it will absorb all the heat because in the experiment in trial one its deg c was 54 in trial two its deg c were 52 in trial 3 its deg c were 54 and the average is 53 so these re sults show that the doghouse will contstanly be warm so this will not mak e the dog comfortable with all the heat while the white lid in the exper iment had very low temperatures its deg c were 42 43 41 and its avera ge came to 42 deg c so this shows that the white will absorb barley a ny heat
26058,10,2,black black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse because it would attract the heat and keep the inside of the dogh ouse warm according to the results of brandi and jerry's experiment lid vs air temperature the balck lid kept the inside of the jar warmer t han any of the other colored lids so therefore the black paint would ke ep the inside of the doghouse warmer than any of the other colors
26059,10,0,dark gray because that would be the color to choose
26060,10,1,white i chose white because white is a nice cool te mperture and dogs have fur so then they would be even a little bit hotter the reason i know that white would be a pretty good temperture is becau se in the experement the white lid was averaged to be 42 degrees calcus and so that is apretty good temperature for the dog house
26061,10,1,dark gray it might get a little warm in the day time bu t it will keep the inside of the dog house warm in the night
26062,10,2,white the color white would be a great color to use in a doghouse because the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog soo when its hot then it wont be to hot in its house i say this bec ause the average temp of the color white is 42 deg c while the other 3 c olors are above this average temp
26063,10,0,light gray this could color might affect the doghouse b ecause the temperature in the doghouse could change depending on the temp erature outside the doghouse
26064,10,2,white the color white might affect the inside of th e doghouse by keeping it the coolest the average for the color black was 53 deg c the average for dark grey was 48 deg c the average for ligh t grey was 45 deg c and the average for white was 42 deg c this shows that white is the coolest color and should be used for the doghouse to k eep the doghouse cool
26065,10,1,white if the doghouse was white then when it is hot outside the dog will be cold and when it is cold outisde the dog has fu r to keep him warm
26066,10,1,white the doghouse will stay cool because white ref lects all the colors heat so the house will stay cool
26067,10,2,black the color black heats the doghouse the most it gets to 53 degrees celcius in there where as dark grey 48 degrees lig ht grey 45 degrees and white 42 degrees so black would be the best colo r
26068,10,1,dark gray the dark gray will obsorb some heat and keep the dog house warm
26069,10,1,black black will affect the dog house by heating it up because black absorbes more energy
26070,10,1,white white was written down as the coolest in the test and you would want the dog house to be cool when it is hot out
26071,10,1,white the internal temperature of the doghouse will be cooler than a doghouse that is colored black this is only the case i f the external temperatures are hot and the dog needs a cool place
26072,10,2,white white is the best color for a doghouse roof because in the summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool inside for the dog the doghouse is for after all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day i chose white to be the best color for a doghouse roof because the average air temprature inside the jar with the white lid was cooler than the air temprature in the light gray dark gray or black lidded jars with a starting temprature of 24 deg c for each jar after ten minutes the temprature of the air in jar with the white lid had a average temprature of 42 deg c while the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53 deg c was the jar with a black lid which means the jar with the white lid had an average air temprature 11 deg c cooler than the average of the jar with the black lid which is quite a diffrence if you ask me
26073,10,2,black the doghouse should be painted black because then the dog will stay warm during the winter if he she has to stay outsi de when the black lid was used in the expiriment it was on averag e 5 degrees warmer inside the jar than with the dark gray lid 8 degrees warmer than the light gray lid and 11 degrees warmer than the white the refore if the doghouse is painted black the dog will keep warm much bet ter than if the doghouse was painted dark gray light gray or white
26074,10,2,black having a black doghouse will keep the dog warm in the winter because the hot lamp experiment shows that darker colors obsorbe more heat than lighter colors
26075,10,1,light gray the darker the color the warmer the doghouse would be black warmest 54 deg c the dog might overheat if the doghouse is too hot the lighter the color the colder the doghouse white lowest 41 deg c they wouldnt want the doghouse to be uncomfortibly cold so dark grey or light grey would be best avg 46 5 deg c
26076,10,2,light gray brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse l ight grey because the dor wouldnt get to hot because his dog houdse is a dark color and it wouldnt get to cold either with a very light color so t hat is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and i ts not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45 deg and for black it was 53 deg a nd dark grey 48 deg and for white was 42 deg light grey is the averag e of them all 53 black 48 dark grey 5 53 black 45 light grey 8 and 53 black 42 white 11 light grey 8 is i n the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey is the color they should pain t the dog house
26077,10,1,black it will make the dog house warmer inside
26078,10,2,light gray light gray would be the best color for the do g house because it would absorb some heat but would not absorb as much a sthe color black if they chose black they dog house would absorb to much heat as shown in the experement that after just 10 minutes the temperatu re of the black lid jar rose 29 deg c but the light grey lid jar only ro se 21 deg c since black absorbs so much heat it could cause the dog to be to hot but light grey allows the dog to still have some heat just no t as much
26079,10,1,light gray the color would keep the dog house cooler tha n the darkgrey and black color also its warmer than the white colored hou se
26080,10,1,black the color black absorbs all the colors of lig ht so the inside of the doghouse would be hot becase the color is absorbi ng and trapping the heat from the light
26081,10,2,light gray dark colors makes things really hot for examp le the black reached up to 54 c white color makes things a little to cold for example it only reached up to 43 c the color gray would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house to make sure the dog wasnt to cold but was to hot because for example the color gray reaced up to 46 c at most making it an equal balance between to hot and to cold
26082,10,1,white white will be better for the doghouse because it will be more heat efficiant and will let in less heat if black was u sed it absorbs more heat then lighter colors would
26083,10,0,black cuhzz i t will effect it cuhz black is a rlly dark colerr so yahh
26084,10,1,black the color will affect the doghouse by making the temperature rise high that it will be to hot for the he or she dog also on trial 1 after 10 minutes it rised to 54 deg c which is to h igh the best color to paint a dog house would be white that was 42 deg c after 10 minutes
26085,10,1,white it would make it nice and cool for the dog
26086,10,1,white the temperature inside the dog house will be cooler than if they use a darker color such as black
26087,10,2,white brandi and jerry would want to paint th e dog house light gray painting the dog house light gray would be the b est paint to color the bog house because in the experiment they had foun d out that painting the house black absorbs more heat energy and pain ting it white will not absorb enoff energy so in the middle will be the best for the dog so not too much thermal energy but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best
26088,10,1,white the best one would be white because the whit e one absorbs less energy the black one absorbs a lot of energy the ave rage of the black one was 53 deg c average for the dark gray was 48 deg c the average for the light gray was 45 deg c and the white wa s 42 deg c the darker the color the more energy it absorbs the lighter the lesser it absorbs energy
26089,10,2,white the color white won't attract as much light a s the black so the dog won't have to suffer really hot weather on sunny d ays the white compared to the black is a better choice because black col or attracts more light for example it averaged a 53 deg c while the whi te averaged a 42 deg c that is a ll deg c difference
26090,10,0,black so the dog will stay warm at night
26091,10,0,white because it could get dirty or somethen
26092,10,1,black i chose black so the inside of the dog house can be warm at about 53 deg c and wont get cold over the time the dog is outside
26093,10,1,white well the color white makes it so that inside of the doghouse would be more cooler because the sun reflects off white and it wont be as hot inside the doghouse
26094,10,1,white i chose white because the darker colors absorb more heat energy that the lighter colors
26095,10,2,black i believe that the best color for the dog hou se would be black especially in the winter because it will keep the inside of the dog house warm because the darker the color of the object the greater increase in air temperature inside the object according to th e data table in hot lamp so the darker the color the warmer t he house or object
26096,10,2,white according to the reults the lighter the colo r the colder the temperature is since white had less heat they would w ant to paint the dog house white
26097,10,2,black if the doghouse is black then it will be warm er i know this because the jar with the black lid h ad an average temperature of 53 deg c
26098,10,2,white the color white would keep the doghouse the c oolest temperature on average the color black is 53 deg c dark gre y is 48 deg c light grey is 45 deg c and white is 42 deg c
26099,10,1,black this color will keep the inside of the dog ho use warm during winter because dark color absorbs more heat energy
26100,10,0,light gray light gray might affect the the doghouse by k eeping the inside colder for the dog
26101,10,2,white by painting the doghouse white the inside of the doghouse will be cool acording to the results of the experiment the data shows that when the lid was black the air temperature was warmest and when the lid was white the air temperature was coolest therefore painting the doghouse white would create a more comfortable temerpature f or the dog
26102,10,1,light gray because light gray is in between hot and cold so the doghouse wont be to hot for him to stay in or too cold for the dog to stay in black being hottest and white being coolest
26103,10,1,black black will mack it hot in the dog house because the lap is hiting black and black atrackes heat
26104,10,0,light gray light gray would be a great color for a dogho use although it can still cause an affect the light gray color can caus e the dog house to not have the right temperature in side the results wo uld be that if the color was light gray is would be about a good temperat ure inside the dog house like in trial 1 in the jar the temperature was 44 in trial 2 the temp was 45 trial 3 it was 46 as the temperature the average was 45 so with that said the light gray color is good enough because the average temp is no t as bad and it wouldnt be so dark inside
26105,10,2,white white it is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the lowest average temperature rise of 18 deg c in the experiment the starting temperature of was 24 deg c and after ten minutes under a lamp the air inside the jar increased by 18 deg c to tal of 42 deg c if black was chosen to be the doghouse colour it will not be suitable for the doghouse because the average temperature rise wo uld be too high
26106,10,2,black the darker the lid color the greater the incr ease in air temperature
26107,10,0,black the wood will be hot
26108,10,1,white white would be the best because then the dog wouldnt be so hot the white had the least heat the whole time so it would nt get as hot as black dark grey or light gray
26109,10,1,white the white paint would keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the sun because it reflects the most energy therefore having the lowest internal temperature
26110,10,2,white white would be the best paint color for the d oghouse in the experiment the temperature in the jar for the white lid averaged 42 deg c the black lid jar averaged a temperature of about 53 deg c the dark gray lid jar averaged 48 deg c and the light gray l id jar averaged 45 deg c the white lid jar was the coolest out of the four
26111,10,1,black it will be warmer inside of the dog house
26112,10,2,dark gray the best paint color for the doghouse would b e dark gray in the experiment of the glass jar it had an average of 48 deg c and was the second highest temperature the highest temperature was the black lid with 53 deg c the difference of the highest temperature and second highest temperature was the 5 deg c if using the dark gray paint color it would still absorb energy to keep the dogs warm but yet be a bit coo l for them too
26113,10,2,white white because it will keep the doghouse at a cool temperature about 42 deg c in the summer when the dog is outside and needs a rest
26114,10,1,black this color would affect the dog house because the black would absorb energy from the sun and make the inside of the do g house hotter then the rest of the colors
26115,10,1,light gray with a light gray dog house the temperature i nside the house would be cool in the summer but warm enough for th e dog in the winter with this balance in temperature you dont have to wo rry about the dog being uncomfortable during any season
26116,10,1,dark gray it didnt get any hotter or cooler therefore it is the best paint color for the dog house because the dog would not be too cold nor too hot
26117,10,1,light gray light gray is more as cooler than black or dark gray in the summer but black and dark gray will be warmer in the winter light gray or white meaning light gray is in the middle
26118,10,1,white in the hot summer months the dog house won't get too hot
26119,10,1,black the darker the coler is the more hotter it is going to be in the inside and as in black what i picked it is going to w arm for the dog to sleep at night
26120,10,0,light gray because it stays at a liveable temp of 45 de grees
26121,10,0,white if they paint the doghouse white then when th e dog goes inside it wont be so hot in there for him to sit in there
26122,10,2,dark gray the dark gray will keep the inside of the dog house warm enough in the winter and not to hot during the summer the dar k gray was an average of 48 deg c which is not as hot as the black lid w hich was an average of 53 deg c and not as cold as the light gray which was and average of 45 deg c
26123,10,0,black the color may affect it by the temperature of the air may be cooler than the other colors
26124,10,1,white the white color will attract less energy than the others thus making the doghouse cooler
26125,10,0,white the color would affect the paint house becaus e if it is a black colored house it will be super dark if it was a whi te color house it would be more lighter during night time
26126,10,1,light gray because you dont want the dog house to be to cool or to warm
26127,10,0,white the color on the outside will either heat up or cool down the doghouse and since white was still warm but not too hot so white is the best color for the doghouse
26128,10,0,black the color might affect the dog house by attra cting the heat to it
26129,10,1,light gray i would choose light gray because then the dog won't be too hot or too cold this is why i would choose light gray to paint the dog house
26130,10,1,white this color will surely make the doghouse much cooler i am not sure whether the question is asking which one will keep the dogg cool or hot so i am choosing white this color will keep the d og cool when it is hot and sunny however this color will not keep the dog warm in the winte r so i am not sure
26131,10,0,white the color that might affect the doghouse is t he white beacuse it was the one that got less then the other three colors
26132,10,2,light gray light gray would be the best choice because you don't want the dog house to cold but you dont want it to warm and the average temperature for the light gray was 45 deg c which is just right for a dog because you don't want your dog to get to hot and the black wouldn't be a good color because darker colors absorb more energy and there was an eight degree difference between the black lid and the light grey lid making the light grey lid the cooler better choice
26133,10,2,white white is a good choice because it will absorb less heat the experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat so it will keep the doghouse cooler
26134,10,2,white brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse wh ite this is because white doesn't attract as much heat i know this beca use in the previous experiment the average temperature for the white lid was lowest at 42 degrees celsius using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot
26135,10,1,dark gray dark gray will make the dog house a bit warme r the data states that it is 48 deg c always
26136,10,1,white white reflects more sun keeping the dog cool er in the summer heat
26137,10,1,light gray light gray won't absorb too much sun in which case heating the interior and it will absorb enough heat on cold days t o warm inside
26138,10,2,dark gray i choose light gray because it had an average temperature of 45 which is right in the middle of temperatures and the e ffect will be warm and cool at the same time when you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an av erage of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not get too ho t and it will not get too cold
26139,10,2,white i think white would be the best color to pain t the dog house i say this because white absorbs less energy maki ng the dog house cooler in the experiment the white on average was 42 deg c and that was the coolest temperature the warmest temperature of the air in side the jar was the black with 53 deg c for a dog inside a doghouse i think it shouldn't be hot for the dog that's why i chose the color tha t made the doghouse the coolest
26140,10,1,black the black wood paint would effect the tempera ture more becaasue the darker a color the more energy in attracts so the black one would be hotter than the white one
26141,10,0,light gray if the color are ligth gray than the dog hous e the doghouse will be cooler becuz of tha gray and it also be warm cuz i t light
26142,10,2,white the dog house will not be to hot the tempera ture will rise but it will not rise alot it will stay in cool for summer and they wouldnt have to worry about the dog house getting to hot white is the one that stayed the coolest and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature the whole time
26143,10,2,black in my oppinion brandi and jerry would want t o paint the doghouse dark gray because it had an average temperature of 48 deg c which is the second hottest temperature out of the four lid colors i think dark gray would be the logical color to paint a dog house because during harsh weather it will keep the dog warm but during the summer it won't be to uncomfortably hot like black may be
26144,10,1,black this color would help keep the inside of the doghouse warm because the data has proved this this would help during wi nter
26145,10,1,white usually a dog house is only used in the summe r so to keep the dog a little less cooler they should use a white paint bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else a long with their heat but blck has all the colors so it obsorbs all color s and their heat so white would be best in the table it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42 deg c the average temputure for lightgray i s 45 deg c the average temp for dark gray is 48 deg c and black's av erage temp is 53 deg c thats an 11 deg c difference whitch could be very important
26146,10,1,white the color would affect the doghouse because the lighter the color is the cooler the house would get if the dog house was black then the doghouse would be too hot
26147,10,1,white the color will heat up the doghouse to about 42 deg c in 10 minutes this is the best color to choose because the bl ack heated up to 53 deg c in 10 minutes therefore the temperature of t he white jar was 9 deg c lower than the black jar making the white cool er
26148,10,1,light gray the doghouse should be light gray because tha t way the air temperature isn't to hot or to cold it's just about in the middle
26149,10,1,white the color would affect the temperature inside the dog house the black would make the temperature inside the greaterst then the dark grey then the light grey then finally the white would h ave the lowest temperature just like the lid color for the lid colors b lack had an average of 53 deg c the dark grey had an average of 48 deg c the light grey would have an average of 45 deg c aand the white had an ave rage of 42 deg c so the temperature for the dog house would be close or be to the same as the temperature of the jar
26150,10,2,white choosing the lightest shade white is the be st colour to paint a dog house because in order to create an environment most comfortable for the dog year round the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer painting the hosue white will ensure that it st ays as cool as it can over summer thus making it the most comfortable fo r the dog the white house will remain coolest because as according to th e data collected the average temperature will be aprox 42 deg c whil e for the other colours they reached much greater temperatures 45 deg lgray 48 deg dgray 53 deg black the white colour was 11 deg coo ler than the darkest colour black thus making it the best colour to pa int a dog house
26151,10,0,dark gray keep it cooler
26152,10,2,light gray a light gray color could give you less heat i n the summer but during the winter when the the sun is out you could get some warmth since in the experiment the black lid would get the most hea t you woulnt want a dog to get to hot but also not to cold
26153,10,0,black cause he might not wamt to sleep in the dogho use cause of the color of it and it might also mess the dogs eyes up to t hat could also be it in this experiment
26154,10,1,black it would make it really hot inside the doghou se because the color black attracks more heat as aposed to colors that a re very bright like white or light gray or light green even
26155,10,1,black painting the doghouse black might affect it b y attracting all the heat to it and might cause the dog to have a heat st roke while is laying inside
26156,10,0,black balck becuase balck goes with every thing
26157,10,2,white this is the best paint color for the dog hous e because in the experament it proved that the white matiral absorbed the least amount of heat therefore making the temp in the jar the lea st
26158,10,2,white i would choose white because it is one of the lightest colors also in the experiment it was proven that white stayed the coldest after 10 minutes therefore in the sun it should stay fairly cold fro the animal living in it
26159,10,1,black the dog house should be painted black because black absorbes heat learned thin when the data table showed that the av erage tempature for black was 53 deg c when the dogs out at night you w ould most likely want it to stay warm
26160,10,1,white because in the summer the dog house wount ge t over heated because the average for the white lid in the hot lamp exper iment was 42 deg c and the black was 53 deg c
26161,10,2,light gray the color chosen will affect the inside of th e doghouse because the color is a factor for the amount of air temperature it attracts from the experiment black attracted the most heat or air temperature with an average of 53 deg c and dark gray had an average of 48 deg c light gray had 45 deg c and the color white with 42 deg c on average based on these results i think light gray is the best paint color for a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of heat fewer than darker colors but from the average air temperature in the glass jar from the experiment the air inside the doghouse would be more withstandable than that of black paint or dark gray which would attract even more heat therefore light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse
26162,10,0,black has the most average
26163,10,2,black i think they should use a black for the dogho use because since we live in a generaly cold area and the black paint wou ld help keep the dog warm at night with the average temp of the air when the area is black is 53 deg c
26164,10,1,light gray light gray would keep the dog house a bit war mer without making it too hot like the black and dark gray would
26165,10,1,dark gray dark grey is best because in the winter the d oghouse will absorbe heat also in the summer the doghouse will not absor be too much heat like if it was black
26166,10,1,light gray it makes the doghouse a little cool but not t oo hot because on hot days it should be cool for the dog to go in there a nd rest on colder days the dog should be able to go in there and still b e a little warm
26167,10,0,black it wold atracket heat or inorge frume t he sun
26168,10,0,dark gray it will become light in there because if you have dark gray it will infect the color from the outside
26169,10,1,light gray the house wouldnt get to hot for the dog and it wouldnt be too cold it would be in the middle
26170,10,0,white
26171,10,2,black i think black would be the best color for the doghouse it will atract more heat inside the doghouse than any other color because in the experiment with the jars the black lid jar had the warmest inside temperature this black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out when it is warm outside and the dog gets hot it can sleep outside
26172,10,1,dark gray it had a steady temperature and for outside it wouldnt be too hot or too cold if the roof was painted dark gray
26173,10,2,white if the doghouse was white the inside of that doghouse would keep the temperature inside cool because like in the experiment the color white only got an average of 42 deg c unlike the col or black which got an average temperature of 53 deg c
26174,10,0,white less heat will be attracted to it
26175,10,0,dark gray
26176,10,1,light gray it will be warm for a dog that is meant to be outside and cool during summer
26177,10,2,white i have chose the color white because it had t he least highest temperature in the data from the previous experiment th e white lid had an average temperature of 42 deg making it the least ho ttest
26178,10,2,white white would make dog house cooler i know this because when the lid color was white the average was 42 deg c compared to the average for black wich the average is 53 deg c
26179,10,2,black black would be the best color because it wou ld keep the house warmer in the experiment black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar 53 deg c
26180,10,2,light gray it would absorb a little amount of heat for t he summer time when it's hot but because it's also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter i know this because the black lid abso rbed the most heat and the white lid absorbed the least heat
26181,10,0,white becase it reflax the light
26182,10,2,black black would kepp the dog house the warmest be cause of the averages of all the others were black 53 dark gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
26183,10,1,black the dog house would be to hot since darker co lors absorb more energy
26184,10,0,black that color would affect the doghouse because it would be too dark in the inside and dogs dont have eye color so it wo uld be hard for the dog to see it also takes way longer to dry then the other colors the other colors dryed in the 40's but the black color dryed in the 50 i would not recomend them to color it black
26185,10,1,light gray in the summer it will not abosrb much heat ke eping the dog cool yet in the winter it will still contain a decent amoun t of heat keeping the dog at least fairly warm
26186,10,1,black the color would affect the dog house because the darkness will help the dog go to sleep better durning the day also i t will affect it because the darker the color the greater the incre ase in air temperature in the doghouse it will also affect it because the darker colors absorb more energy
26187,10,2,black black is the best color for the doghouse in o rder to keep the dgohouse warm brandi and jerry's data showed that the d arker the lid or in this case doghouse the darker the color the more increase in air temperature which in the lid experiment the data showed that black on average had the highest data of 53 deg c while others lik e dark gray and light gray had averages of 48 deg and 45 deg c
26188,10,2,dark gray the dark gray will affect the temperature of the doghouse just enough that the animal that's living in it wont freeze or overheat because the dark gray color in the experiment didn't collect as much heat in the experiment as the black so it wont overheat the the animal and it collect more heat than white or light gray so the opposite effect wont take place
26189,10,1,light gray light gray would keep the temperature in the summer down so the dog wont over heat black dark gray would be to hot in the summer the dog would over heat white would be to cold in the winter and summer the dog would freeze that is why light gray would be perfect for the dog house color
26190,10,2,white i would choose white because it would make th e inside of the doghouse cooler than a dark color so the dog wouldn't hav e to be super hot in the sun the average temperature for white was 42 deg after ten minutes and it was 53 deg for black showing that black makes it ho tter inside
26191,10,2,light gray light gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it cooler than it would with black paint but warmer than it would with white in warmer tempatures the paint will not asborb as much sunlight so therefore the inside of the doghouse will not be as hot the black paint had an average tempature of 53 deg c while the light gray had an average tempature of 45 deg c that is a difference of 8 deg c the light gray will keep the doghouse cooler but it will also keep it a little bit warmer than white paint the white paint had a n average tempature of 42 deg c the light gray paint would keep t he doghouse 3 deg c warmer then the white paint but 8 deg c cooler tha n the black paint
26192,10,0,white white will bring more light in the dog house because it is a light color and it attracts light and it will bring more in
26193,10,2,black black because it well make the dog hous e warmer and the results to the black colr is saying it warmer
26194,10,1,light gray the doghouse would be cooler in the summer an d not as cold in the winter the light gray lid was cooler than the black lid which would make it better for useing in a hot environment the most comfortable color varies with the kind of environment and i am assu ming this is a rather warm environment
26195,10,2,white the best answer would be white because white is a light color that won't absorb heat and dehydrate the dog during the summer when brandi and jerry performed their experiment they found that when a jar had a black lid on it the temperature inside the jar was an a verage of 53 deg c whereas when there was a white lid on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42 deg c that is an 11 deg differance there for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white
26196,10,2,white how the white might affect the doghouse is be cause it will be alot cooler than the other dark colors because the avera ge temperature of the darker colors are more then whites
26197,10,1,white it might not give it much light from the sun or any heat because darker colors attract more energy and light just lik e with the jars and the lamp the jar with a black lid had the highest av erage therefore proving that darker colors attract more energy
26198,10,1,white painting the doghouse white will reflect the sunlight making it cooler in there
26199,10,2,black well darker colors absob more heat than ligh ter energy so if you paint the doghouse black than the inside of the dog house will be warmer than the inside of a white painted doghouse when br andi and jerry used a black lid dark color for the experiment the resul ts were in the low 50's range 52 54 deg c but when they used the whit e lid light color the results were in the low 40's range 41 43 deg c
26200,10,1,light gray in the summer the dog house will not be hot
26201,10,0,dark gray the dark gray wil affect the dog house becaus e no matter what color the doghoue is the room will still be dark
26202,10,1,dark gray the dog house will be warm during winter so t hat the dog will warm and cofortable
26203,10,2,white this color will help the dog house cool becau se it is the clor that remained the coolest during the experiment
26204,10,1,light gray i would go with light gray because in the exp eriment it was at a good temperature of 45 deg f black was to hot at a temperature of 53 deg f dark gray was a little to warm at a temerature of 48 deg f and white was a little to cold at a temerature of 42 deg f
26205,10,2,black if brandi and jerry were to paint a dog house the color they should choose is black because its the darkest color so it absorbs the most thermal heat my theory is correct because in bradi a nd jerry's hypothesis the darker the lid color the greater the inc rease is air temperature in the glass jar because darker color absorbs m ore energy
26206,10,0,white using the color white to paint the dog house would make the dog house be the lowest increase in air temperature then t he other colors the dog house started at 24 degrees for each trial the dog house would be about 42 degrees and i know that because the first trial was 42 degrees the second trial was 43 degrees and the third trial was 41 degress the average temperature is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color to use
26207,10,1,white it would make the doghouse cooler inside
26208,10,1,white if you paint the doghouse white it will be c ooler inside than if you painted it black since black absorbs more energ y it will get hotter faster than if it was painted white
26209,10,2,white they should use white because in the other ex priment white was the coolist so if they use white it will not get to ho t in the dog house
26210,10,2,light gray the color of the dog house should be light gr ay because it doesn't absorb as much energy as black and dark gray which had the temperatures of 53 deg c and 48 deg c in the experiment so the dog won't feel very hot either and since dogs are always jumping around they probably already are hot enough also if it does get cold light gr ay will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm becuase it's temp erature was 48 deg c which is only 2 deg c less than dark gray so i th ink light gray will be the best color for the dog house
26211,10,0,black because the lighter one top put on the doghouse is the white not the black because it a difference of nine
26212,10,2,light gray the color white might affect the doghouse be cause the air temperature on the inside would be a lot cooler but not to o cold and at the same time not too hot when the lid color of the glass jar was black the average air temperatuire was 53 deg c after only 10 minutes when the starting temperature was 24 deg c which i believe mig ht be too hot for a dog living in a black doghouse when their was a whit e lid the average temperature after the same amount of time and startin g at the same temperature of 24 deg c was 42 deg c which i believe wo uld be too cold for a dog living in a white doghouse i believe the light gray lid air temperature was niether too hot nor too cold because afte r 10 minutes and a starting temperature of also 24 deg c it's average a ir temperature inside was 45 deg c
26213,10,1,white white is the best color for the doghouse beca use lighter colors absorb less energy which is shown on the data chart it has an average tempature of 41 deg c versus the black lid which has a n average tempature of 53 deg c
26214,10,1,dark gray dark grey would be good because it wont get t o hot or to cold for the dog because the average temp for dark grey was 4 8 deg c
26215,10,1,light gray it will cool and heat up the dog house
26216,10,1,white it will make it less hotter for the dog
26217,10,1,black if it was color black it would make the dog h ouse hot
26218,10,2,white white would make it cooler inside for the dog because it would reflect more heat instead of taking it in also it wa s cooler inside because white's average was the lowest 42 deg
26219,10,2,white i think they should paint the color white be cause white absorbs less heat than black does because if black dark gra y or light gray were to be painted on the doghouse that would absorb mo re heat than white would
26220,10,1,black if you paint the doghouse black the inside o f the doghouse would be warmer than if you painted the doghouse a lighter colour such as light grey or white
26221,10,1,white white paint will make the doghouse less hot because it attracts less energy from the sun
26222,10,1,white white would be the best color to paint a dog house because the light color soaks in less light than darker colors br andi and jerry's experiment found that a jar with a black lid was 53 deg c after ten minutes but a jar with a white lid was only 42 deg c
26223,10,0,white the doghouse will be warm when the sun hits i t but it won't be so hot and it will be closer to room temperature for th e dog
26224,10,2,black when the jar had a black lid the average temperature after 10 minute was 53 deg when the lid was white the average ttemperature was 42 deg because the black lid made the jar warmer the doghouse's roof should be painted black to keep the inside of the dog house and the dog warmer
26225,10,1,black now the doghouse can be warm in the winter b ecause 'dark colors absorb more light' and then the dog can just play ar ound in the yard in summer because everyone usually enjoys sun even dogs
26226,10,2,black by painting the doghouse black the air insid e the doghouse will be warmer than if the doghouse was another color in the experiment the air from the jar with the black colored lid was 53 deg which is 2 deg higher than the dark grey lid 8 deg higher than the light grey lid and 11 deg higher than the white lids air temperature this shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it
26227,10,2,white it wpuld make it less hot by having white bec ause white is a light color and does not coduct that much heat as have bi n shown by brandi and jerry the results were that white had the lowest av erage at 42 deg c
26228,10,1,black i choose the color black because it keeps in more light and it has hotter temperature all the others had lower temper atures and the black was the highest temperature
26229,10,1,dark gray dark gray may attract more heat to the dog ho use but no as much as black
26230,10,2,dark gray the best color for the doghouse is dark gray because it won't be so dark that it will overheat the inside of the dogho use and it will also retain it's temperature longer through out the night the dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48 deg that i s better than the 53 deg average for the black and the 45 deg a verage for light gray because it will not be way too warm but it will ret ain it's heat
26231,10,1,black the color black would effect the inside of th e doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat keeping the dog warm as in the experiment while the black lid was over the thermometer and th e light was 5 centimeters away the temperature on the thermometer increa sed by 29 deg c
26232,10,1,dark gray doghouse will not to hot or cold in summer an d winter
26233,10,1,light gray light gray would work best because then insid e the dog house it would still be warmer than outside but when it was ho t outside it would not be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog ho use was painted black
26234,10,2,black with the color black as the dog house the ins ide temperature will be much hotter than the temperatures of the other co lors because the average temperature for black on the experiment wa s 53 deg c for dark gray ave temp was 48 deg c for light gray it wa s 45 deg c ave temp and for the white lid the ave temp was 42 deg c controlled varible temp in jar before starting exp responding air temp inside jar after 10 min uder lamp manipulated lid color
26235,10,1,black the black color absorbs more energy so when i ts cold outside the inside can heat up by the sun
26236,10,1,black if the dog house is black it will increase th e tempeture of the air inside the dog house making it warmer inside it
26237,10,1,light gray it will keep it not to hot and not to cold be couse of the coler that its not to dark adn not to light so it will keep it ice andf cool not to hot or not to cold
26238,10,2,white the reason they should pick white is because it will cool down the tempature in the dog house the reason i know that i s in the data they did for the experiment it tells you that white is cool er than the rest of the colors
26239,10,1,black if a dog house was painted black then the do g house would stay warmer inside because the experiment shows that the ai r temprature in a glass jar with a black lid on it had the warmest air te mprature of 53 54 and 52
26240,10,2,white this color will keep the dog house rather coo l that way the dog will not over heat itself in the experiment lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature
26241,10,2,light gray the light gray color might affect the inside of the doghouse because if it isnt to dark or to light the inside wont be to hot or to cold this is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy the light gray was about in the middle with 45 deg c so i thought it was the best choice for the dog
26242,10,2,white white will be the best color for the doghouse because the white lid kept the jar coolest meaning that white paint wil l keep the doghouse coolest because it reflects more energy than any of t he other colors the white lid kept the jar an average of three deg rees celcius cooler than any other color
26243,10,1,white if brandi and jerry dont want the dog to get to hot then they would want to pick white because it does not increase th e air temperature as much as black
26244,10,2,black i think black would beb best to use for the d oghouse because on winter nights when it gets cold out the black color o f the doghouse will keep it warmer since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors black was 53 deg c after 10 minutes while white was 42 deg c that is a change of 11 deg c warmer then the other
26245,10,1,dark gray this color will keep the doghouse warm since it will probably be outside and it won't be to hot either
26246,10,2,dark gray the dark grey would keep the doghouse warm b ut not too hot this is shown in the experiment when dark grey was the se cond warmest color
26247,10,0,dark gray the color of the dog house will cang the air pressure in side
26248,10,2,dark gray i believe that dark gray would be the best pa int color for the dog house although the temperature inside the do house would be warmer it would not be super warm and make the dog overheat a lso the air wouldn't be too cold that the dog would freeze at night when he sleeps in it considering that dark gray had an average of 48 deg inside it appears perfect compared to the white with an average of 42 deg and the black with an average of 53 deg
26249,10,0,dark gray dark gray would be best to build a doghouse b ecause it the temperture stays the same every single time which means if its cold the temperture stays the same if its hot the temperture stays the same and doesnt get to hot
26250,10,2,white white would cause the inside of the doghouse to not be so hot on the inside so the dog can stay cooler because with th e white lid the inside of the jar was the coldest out of all the other j ars
26251,10,1,dark gray the tempeture inside the dog house will be wa rm
26252,10,2,white they should use the white color because white doesn't heat up as fast after 10 minutes white's tempature was 42 deg while black's was 53 deg that is an 11 deg difference so the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white
26253,10,2,white the color white is best for the doghouse beca use the experiment was on the effect of different lid colors on the air t empurature inside a class jar so looking at the chart the color white h ad an average of 42 deg c which means that the increase of air was coole r so the color white will affect the doghouse by the increase of air fl ow and be cooler then any other color
26254,10,2,white the white dog house would not attract as much heat as the darker colors so if they want to keep their dog at a cool t emperature then they should go with the white color the average tempera ture for the black colored jar is 53 deg c the average temperature for the white colored jar is 42 deg c the black lided jar is 11 deg c h igher than the white lided jar
26255,10,0,black it will usually always be 53 deg c in the dog house because that is the average tempature
26256,10,1,light gray the temperature of the doghouse with a light gray paint coating on it would make the doghouse warm but not cold or hot of a temperature of around 45 deg celsius
26257,10,0,light gray the dog will might sleep on the doghouse
26258,10,2,white the white attracted the least heat than any o f the other colors the white low data for white was 41 deg and the hig h data was 43 deg
26259,10,2,white the white would keep the dog house nice and c ool in the experiment white attracted the least heat example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black
26260,10,2,white painting a dog house white will keep it coole r than other colors in the experiment white had an average temp of 42 deg c while black had a 53 deg c average
26261,10,2,white white would be the best color to paint the do g house in the experiment white didnt absorb that much heat stayi ng at a temperature of around 42 deg this would mean that the dog hous e would stay a cool temperature for the dog
26262,10,2,white the white paint will be the coolest paint cho ice for the doghouse in the data brandi and jerry collected white had t he lowest temperature average of 42 deg c the next coolest was light gr ey with an average of 45 deg c dark grey with an average of 48 deg c a nd the hottest was black with an average of 53 deg c therefore white pa int will make the doghouse the coolest
26263,10,1,black since black absorbs more light than the dark gray light gray and white it will make the doghouse warmer this will help because in the winter when he needs the doghouse the most it will k eep him warm when he is inside of it
26264,10,2,white white would be the best paint color for the d og house because on a hot day the dog wont get as hot this is because f rom the results it was that white paint got as high as 43 and black got a s hot as 54
26265,10,1,light gray light gray would affect the doghouse by keepi ng it slightly warmer in the winter and cool in the summer
26266,10,2,white it would keep the doghouse cooler especiall y in summer months when there are high temperatures outside ex in the experiment the average temperature of white was 42 deg the coolest temperature of them all this would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating
26267,10,2,white if the dog house is white then it will be co oler since the white lid made the inside of the jar 42 deg c and the b lack lid made the inside of the jar 53 deg c then we know that white wil l make the doghouse cooler
26268,10,1,black by making the doghouse black it would absorve heat energy that will make the doghouse warmer than if it was a lighter color
26269,10,2,white white would affecvt the doghouse by making it cooler and not so hot this is because in the experiment the black absor bed the heat so it would be hotter so making it white according to the da ta will make the doghouse cooler
26270,10,0,white white would make it more comfortable for the dog and it would be warmer than black because the black absorbs more ener gy than light colors
26271,10,1,white if the doghouse was painted white then the a ir temperature inside wouldn't change very much it would be cooler
26272,10,2,black the inside of the doghouse would most likely be the hottest beacuse the black absorbs the sunlight therefore it would become hot on the inside results from the experiment are that the black lid had a high of 54 degrees celcius and that is higher than the rest of the colors
26273,10,1,dark gray according to the results that they got this c olor remained constant throught all 4 trials this means that if they use this to color the doghouse the dog wont get to hot or too cold but it wi ll remain a average temperature of 48 deg
26274,10,0,white decrease the tepmpature
26275,10,2,white hite will keep the doghouse cooler inside bec uase white attracks less energy than black dark grey and light grey th e white was the lowest average tempatue a 42 deg c
26276,10,1,white if they paint it white then the doghouse wont absorb much heat in the experiment the average temperature in a white li d jar was 42 deg c
26277,10,0,light gray the dog might not be able to see it in the ni ght
26278,10,1,light gray if it was black and it was summer the dog wo uld be hot and if it was white and it was winter the dog would freeze s o light gray would be the best color for the dog if the tempature was 24 deg outside and the dog was cold he could go in his dog house and it would be around 45 deg degrees in his dog house so he wont freeze as m uch as he would as if he was outside
26279,10,2,white the black paint made the air in the jar 53 degrees while the white paint was only 42 degrees the white paint woud be best for the doghouse because it would keep the doghouse cooler if it was hot outside
26280,10,1,black this color might affect the doghouse because when the sun shines the sun in black then the temperature will ri se from the dog house and making the doghouse hot
26281,10,2,white white will keep the doghouse the coolest beca use the other colors got tempatures of 53 deg c 48 deg c and 45 deg c but the white jar got 42 deg c
26282,10,2,white this would make the dog house cool in the summer because in the experiment the white lid jar had th coldest temperature of 41 deg c
26283,10,2,dark gray the doghouse wouldn't be too cold or too hot it would be right in the middle black which is 53 c average would be a little too hot and white which is 42c would be too cold so the one i m the middle which is dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house
26284,10,0,white the white might let sunlight come in the dog house
26285,10,1,black black will affect the dog house because when is sunny and bright the color will attract the heat and it will make it e ven hotter in the out side and the inside of the dog house
26286,10,1,white white is best for the dog house because if it was black the dog house would get hot
26287,10,0,black black will affect the doghouse because dark c olors absorb more energy
26288,10,2,white by choosing the color white brandi and jerry 's doghouse would be colder than if they chose any of the other color opt ions in the experiment the average temperature for black lid was 53 deg c for dark gray 48 deg c for light gray 45 deg c and finally for white 42 deg c which means that the white doghouse would be colder than any of the other color options
26289,10,2,light gray i chose the color light gray light gray would make the dog house around 45 deg c average on the inside the results show that light gray was an average of 45 deg c and black was an averag e of 53 deg c white was an average of 42 deg c light gray is 3 degre es warmer then white and 8 degrees cooler then black light gray is a col or in between the temperatures leaving the dog house not to hot or not t o cold
26290,10,1,light gray would make it warm in winter and not boiling hot in summer
26291,10,2,black the other colors had between 40 deg and 50 deg but black is hotter then the other colors
26292,10,0,light gray black could turn the inside of the dog house to hot for a dog to be in it so i choose light gray because the heat it a ttracts will make the inside nice and warmin ten minuets it would only be 45 deg compared to the black were in ten minetus it would be53 deg w hich would clearly be to hot for a dog
26293,10,2,white white because white reflects the sun and the doghouse wont get hot like it would if you use black in your data it sh ows that in the trials white will be the least hot color
26294,10,1,dark gray i chose dark gray because the darker the colo r the more heat it attracts for example during the winter the dog ins ide the doghouse might get cold so the sun shinning on the doghouse will absorb the heat and let the heat inside but sometimes the dog might not want so much heat so i picked dark gray instead of black also another example is in the summer time if the dog doesnt want to go outside and stays in the doghouse he doesnt have to be so hot but he can also go o utside if the doghouse is to warm
26295,10,1,black black because then in the winter when its get s cold whatever sunlight there is it will obsoub the heat and make it sli ghtly warmer
26296,10,2,white using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day the average temperature of the white lid was 42 deg c and the average temperature of the blace lid was 53 deg c the white lid was 11 deg c cooler then the jar with the blac k lid
26297,10,1,light gray it will keep it warm for those cold night an d keep it cool for those hot summer days
26298,10,2,black using a black paint color for the doghouse wi ll make the doghouse nice and warm for a dog during the cold seasons when a doghouse is needed the most due to the data a black lid color had an average of 53 deg c that will affect the doghouse by making the doghou se much more warmer in temperature a white lid only had an average of 42 deg c making it too cold for the dog that's why a black doghouse is b est for a doghouse to keep the dog warm
26299,10,2,white white would be the best paint color because it doesnt attract as much heat as black light gray or dark gray because its the lightest color this is good because in the summer if the dog house attracted a lot of heat the dog could over heat and get sick the black lid got the hottest air temperature having an average of 53 deg c dark gray was the second hottest having an average air temperature of 48 deg c light gray had the second coolest air temperature on average being 45 deg c and white had the lowest air temperature with an average of 42 deg c these results show that the white lid attracted the least amount of heat and is therefore why i believe that a white dog house would be best
26300,10,0,dark gray the dog house will be warm but it will probab ly always stay around the same temperature because in the trial dark gray was always 48 degrees celcius
26301,10,1,light gray light gray would not affect that much in the inside of the house because when it's warm the dog would not be too hot a nd when it's too cold the dog would still be able to be warm as you can see in the data collected if they choose black color to paint the doghous e amp it was hot the dog which could harm the dog and if it they painted it white around winter the dog would be freezing so i believe t hat light gray would be perfect because it doesnt affect the inside of th e doghouse as much as the other colors
26302,10,1,white i would say black because it exsord bes heat to make it worm inside and th ey said the dark the color the greater the air temputure in the glass jar
26303,10,2,white if you paint it white the doghouse will be co oler in the hot summer sun in the experiment the average temperature for the white lid was 42 deg but it was 53 deg for the black lid you pr obably don't want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white
26304,10,0,dark gray it will keep the doghouse's interior at an av erage temperature
26305,10,2,white white would affect the inside of the doghouse becuase it is a light color so it will absorb less enrgy becuase the dar ker the color the more enrgy it will absorb in teh data table from their experiment black absorbed the most energy and white absorbed the least energy so that is why they should choose white for the doghouse
26306,10,0,black the best paint color for the dog house would be black because the darker the doghouse the grater chance it will have o ut in the sun
26307,10,2,white the best color would be white because white had an average temperature of 42 deg c compared to the other temperatures white would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible
26308,10,0,black black will efect the dog house alot in the su mmer because balck is an energy color
26309,10,1,white this color will affect the doghouse by making it colder if they live in a hot place this would be the best color to c hoose from
26310,10,2,white i think that brandi and jerry should paint th e doghouse white i believe that white would be the best color because in the results it shows that white collects less heat and energy that wpul d be good because if it was sunny and the dog wanted to go somewhere cool he would have his white dog house that doesnt suck in all of the heat
26311,10,2,dark gray the best paint color for the dog house would be dark gray because it will wont get to hot or to cold in the dog house for the dog i know this because in the results the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees c after 10 minutes of being under the lamp
26312,10,2,light gray light gray will keep the doghouse cooler that black because lighter colors reflect more light than darker colors dark colors do not reflect light well instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures in winter light gray will keep the doghouse slighty warmer than white would and it will keep the doghouse cooler in the summer
26313,10,0,light gray it will heat the doghouse up just enough to b e the perfect temperature
26314,10,1,light gray on hot sunny days the color of the house wouldn't absorb so much heat so the house woldnt get so hot but if it was a cold day the colors of the house could reflect the cold air becuas e lighter colors reflect heat amp darker colors absorb heat
26315,10,0,light gray because the dog might be jumpy and get mud paw prints on the house
26316,10,2,black the paint color will help to keep the dog war m becuse in the results of the experiment the black lid heated up faster
26317,10,1,white the best color would be white because as show n in the table white absorbs less heat energy and therefore stays cooler so that means the dog would stay cooler
26318,10,2,white the color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler i know this because the temperature for the air in the glass jar with the black lid was warmer then the white lid
26319,10,2,black in the experiment the black lid on the jar he ld the most heat so if you colored the doghouse black the temperature ins ide the doghouse would stay at a higher constant temperature the black l id had the highest average temperature of 53 deg c dark gray had an ave rage temperature of 48 deg c light gray had an average of 45 deg c and white had the lowest temperature with 42 deg c
26320,10,2,white white would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer the average temperature of the white lid jar was 42 deg while the averge temperature of the black lid jar was 53 deg the white was 11 deg cooler so if the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer
26321,10,2,dark gray if brandi and jerry painted the doghouse dark gray i think it would be just warm enough in the winter and just cool e nough in the summer because dark gray has the medium warm temperature on the chart about the colored lids
26322,10,1,dark gray i chose dark gray cause it will be warm for the dogs in the winter and cool in the summer
26323,10,2,white in the experament the color white absorbed less heat so if you want your dog to stay cool you should pick white that way he or she isnt as hot
26324,10,0,dark gray easy to light make stay drak
26325,10,2,white the purpose of a dog house is to have a place where a dog could get out of the sun or rain white is a good choice bec ause it let the least amount of heat into the jar the tempature of the w hite jar was an average of 11 deg c less than the tempature of bla ck jar
26326,10,1,white it will be cooler inside
26327,10,2,white this color will cool down the dog house the results show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than al l other colors in the expirement
26328,10,1,light gray i think light gray paint would work best to paint the dog house because in the summer black would be way to hot for the dog the dog would feel most comfertable in a light colerd house in t he summer so that it is a comfertable tempuature but in the winnter white would be to cold and the dog would freeze the dog would want to be warm in the winter in the expirament the black heated to 53 deg c an d the white heated to 42 deg c witch is a difference of 11 deg c that is why the dog house should be light gray insted of black white or dark gray
26329,10,2,white painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house the jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar the darker the color of the lid got the warmer the inside of the jar was
26330,10,0,white i think white because had the less average in side the glass the reason i didnt pick the other colors is because it is gonna be to dark so therfore you couldnt see anything t night so t heir i would pick white because u can see them better
26331,10,1,black black might affect the doghouse because its going to be dark hot and not cmfortable
26332,10,2,white i chose white because the white paint color d oesn't abosorb that much energy than the other colors and also the air te mperature inside wouldn't be as high as the other colors so if the white doghouse was placed under the sun and the starting temperature would be 24 deg c the average temperature would only rise up to 42 deg c but if the color of the doghouse was black or gray than the temperature would b e in the 45 deg c 53 deg c so white doghouse would be a great pick f or the color of the doghouse
26333,10,1,light gray i picked light gray because in the winter he can be warm and in the summer cool this color means that we wouldnt be hot on the summer and cold in the winter
26334,10,2,black black will make the doghouse to hot the dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable i n the lab the black got way more heat then the others colors that were u sed
26335,10,0,white white doesnt take in colors from the rainbow like black and other colors
26336,10,2,black black absorbs heat therefore it would make th e dog house warmer than all of the other colors this can be supported be cause in the expirement black got up to 53 deg c and the white only got up to 42 deg c black was the warmest
26337,10,1,light gray light gray would be best because it wouldnt b e not to hot and not to cold
26338,10,1,dark gray dark gray because it wouldn't be to hot and it wouldn't be to cold
26339,10,1,black black will keep the dog warm but if you live in a hot area than white
26340,10,2,light gray the dog house color should be light gray beca use in the lid experiment the hottest color was black and the coolest col or was white i chose light gray because you dont want the dog to be to c old in the dog house because in thelid experiment the coldest lid w as the white lid and the average temperature for that lid was 42 deg so i though is stead of having the dog house that cold why not have it ligh t gray because the average temperature for the light gray lid turned out to be 45 deg
26341,10,2,white it should be white because in the experiment the white lid had the lowest air tempeture you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer
26342,10,2,white the color white would be good for the doghous e becuase it is the color that does not atract heat so the inside of the doghouse wont be hot in the experiment the color white was the lowest te mpeture out of the other colors so it would be the best color for the dog house
26343,10,2,white i chose white because the white was the coole st in all 4 trials the white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keep ing it cool on hot days the dog would stay cool
26344,10,1,white if they pick white then the dog will be more cold than if they picked black this is because the darker colors like bla ck and gray take in more heat and energy and if they pick white it takes in less heat and energy so therefor brandi and jerry should pick a dark c olor
26345,10,0,light gray if you paint the inside of the doghouse light gray it would affect the temp of the inside of the doghouse it would ke ep it warm inside if it was cold outside
26346,10,1,black it might affect the doghouse because it obesv ers heat energy with a darker color
26347,10,1,white white paint would make the dog house cooler b ecause white paint reflects light
26348,10,2,light gray i chose light gray because that way the dogho use could stay cool and the dog wouldn't be too hot black was an average of 53 and light gray was 45 so its a just right roof
26349,10,1,black black absorbs more heat from the sun this is good beacuse in the winter the dog will be very warm insidebut durning th e hot summer ddays the dog probly wont use it so black would be the best option
26350,10,1,white white can reflect more heat then black becaus e black absorbs more heat
26351,10,2,white white would be the best color for the dog hou se because in the experiment the data in the chart shows that white kept the coolest temperature of 41 deg c light gray had the second coolest t emperaturee of 44 deg c dark gray had the second hottest temperature of 48 deg c and black had the hottest temperature of 54 deg c
26352,10,0,white the color white would be a good color for a d og house because from the data it says that the average temperature was 4 2 deg in side the jar thats only went up 18 deg
26353,10,1,light gray the color light gray will heat the dog house but it wont over heat it and it will not under heat it either
26354,10,1,black blacvk will affect the doghouse becuase it wi ll make it warmer for the dog to like in
26355,10,1,light gray i would chose light gray because on a cold da y any heat you be absorbed into the doghouse and the dog wouldnt be that cold but on a hotter day the gray wouldnt let in so much heat the the dog would be to hot
26356,10,2,black it will make the dog house warmer than any of the other colors because in the experiment the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the dog house
26357,10,1,black dark grey keeps a consistant heat level so it will not get super hot or cold in hot and cold seasons this will keep a dog more comfortable
26358,10,2,dark gray they should use the dark gray beause they want the dog house warm for the winter and the nights but not to warm because of summer if they use the dark gray then the dog house stays warm for the winter and not too hot for the summer this color will affect the inside because it is a darker color but it is not too dark the dark gray willkeep the dog house warm and cozy for the dog but not to warm for the summer the dark gray kept the jar at a tempature of 48 deg the black kept it at 53 deg the light gray kept it at 45 deg and the white kept it at 42 deg thease results show that if they used black the dog hose would get to hot if they used the white the dog house would be too cold the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog
26359,10,1,white the color white would effect the dog house by making it cooler inside
26360,10,2,light gray that color would effect the dog house because when the sun was up it would maintain 44 deg 46 deg c that would keep the dog comfortable while the sun was out
26361,10,2,white the color white might affect the doghouse bec ause since white is a very light color it does not absorb light as well a dark color would the dark color would not only absorb the light but woul d also create heat energy from the results in the experiment white was th e color that i had chhosen because the air in the glass jar did not get n ear as hot as all the others also picking the color that didnt create as much heat as all the others is the best to choose because then the dog st ays cool
26362,10,1,white it would not affect the doghouse to much beca use it absorbs less heat then the other colors and that allows the doghou se to not get to hot
26363,10,1,dark gray dark gray will make the dog house absorb alot of energy but not as much as black because in the experiment it averaged at 48 deg c and black averaged at 53 deg c
26364,10,1,white white has less energy absorbed so it will coo l down better than black would
26365,10,1,white they should paint the dog house white because its is a light color and attracts less heat the black lid got the highest tempature showing they should not use black pain because it attra cts heat
26366,10,2,white this color will affect the doghouse by making it cooler on the inside because in the air temperature data brandi and jerry figured out that white colors didnt attract much heat because compa red to the black to white lid the black lid was 11 deg c more hot than the white lid
26367,10,2,white white would be a good color for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb as much energy as the other colors this means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot in the scenario the temperature of the air for the white lid was 42 deg c and the temperatures of the black dark gray and light gray lids were 53 deg c 48 deg c and 45 deg c this information shows that the white lid had a lower temperat ure than the other three lids
26368,10,2,white if the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler then the rest of the colors in the experiment the white lid was 11 degrees cooler then the black
26369,10,1,white i would paint it white that way showing fro m the table the tempurature wouldnt get so hot
26370,10,2,light gray the color light gray would be the best paint for the doghouse during the experiment light grey had an average of 48 deg c compared to black whos average was 53 deg c and white whos was 42 deg c light grey would affect the doghouse becasue it is a color that soaks up heat but not so much that it would overheat the doghouse
26371,10,1,white so it dosent get hot in the house
26372,10,2,white the dog house will remain cooler in the summe r the white lid only had an average of 42 deg c in the jar while the black lid had an average of 53 deg c in the jar
26373,10,1,dark gray this color would keep the doghouse warmer dur ing the winter and hotter during the summer therefore this would be a g ood paint color for the doghouse i know this because in the experiment t hey did the air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar wa s around 45 deg while the darkest colored lid was hotter and the ligh test was cooler
26374,10,1,white because the lighter the doghouse is the coole r it is in the sun
26375,10,2,white if brandi and jerry chose white as the color for their doghouse then it'll affect the temperature by it being much cooler inside rather than a black or dark gray color which would make it much warmer
26376,10,1,white white will attract a less amount of heat to t he doghouse it is the best paint color because it will provide shelter f or the dog from the sun and provide a cooler environment
26377,10,1,white if they used white for the color of the dog hous it would keep the inside of it cool because white reflects ligh t
26378,10,1,dark gray i choose dark gray because the color will not make the doghouse too cold and not too hot the results showed that the highest temputure was 48 deg c and the lowerest was 48 deg c
26379,10,1,light gray i would chose light gray because from all the colors it isn't the least amount of air temperature and it isn't the gre atest so i believe that its just right for the dog because it won't suf ficate or it wont have to much the first trial for the light greyt was 4 4 deg c and the temperature just went up by one which makes it 45 deg c and the third trial it also went up by one 46 deg c this makes the hou se very predictable about what the temperature is going to be
26380,10,2,white a white doghouse would make the inside of tha t doghouse cooler in the summer but it wouldnt make it as warm in the wi nter since in the expirament the white lid captured less light than any other color of lid
26381,10,1,dark gray this color will make the temperature in the d og house will cause the dog house to stay cool but also collect heat in the experiment the dark gray got up to 48 deg c
26382,10,2,black black will make the doghouse warmer than the other colors because it got an average of 53 while the other colors got i n the 40's
26383,10,2,black black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most black based on the experim ent was able to absorb the most light energy out of all the colored lids for example in trial 1 black had a termperature of 52 degrees c elcius compared to dark gray which was 48 degrees celcius light gr ay had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius evident ly black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors
26384,10,1,white white becase the doghouse wont get to hot for the dog and the temurature will be at a low risk for the dog to get heat stroke
26385,10,1,light gray light gray is a good choice because it keeps the doghouse cool on a hot day but it will keep some heat on cooler days
26386,10,1,black this color will make the doghouse absorb more light because it is black heat will absorb on this faster then dark gr ay light gray or white
26387,10,2,white if they use white the doghouse will be cooler than if they used black because the average temperature inside the jar w as 42 deg c for a white lid and 53 deg c for a black lid
26388,10,1,light gray i chose light grey because it will still attr act heat and absorb some but not a ton this way the dog house will be at the right tempature and out of the sun choosing a light color for this will be good for spring summer fall or those winter days when the sun comes out it will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint it light grey
26389,10,1,white the white dog house can help the dog cool off and it keeps it cooller in the dog house unlike black and the darker colors that abosorb the heat and then so warm the doghouse and there by inc reasing the tem deg
26390,10,1,white white because that color doesnt absorbs enery and the doghouse be cooler
26391,10,1,white it will make it cooler in there so its not b urning hot in the summer
26392,10,1,black if its black the doghouse might cunduct more heat but if you choose a lighter color it will not atract as much heat as the dark color
26393,10,2,white brandi and jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun white would be best because it will absorb the least energy keeping the temp down in the test a black colored lid was and average temp of 53 while the white color was 42 and 11 deg difference
26394,10,2,light gray light gray would make it so the dog was cool inside the house and not to hot and to cold at black the temperatu re was 53 deg c and at white the temperature was 42 deg c but at light gray it was 45 deg c so then the temperature would not be to hot or to cold
26395,10,1,white brandi and jerry should use the color white f or the dog house because brighter colors reflect light to keep the dor co ol unless it is the winter time and you want to keep the dog warm a dar ker color would be better
26396,10,2,white i chose white for the color of paint for the dog house white might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day when the glass jar had a black lid the average temperature was 53 deg c when the glass jar had a white lid after ten minutes the average temperature in the jar was only 42 deg c this is a difference o f 11 deg c white is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse bec ause it will keep a dog cool in the middle of the day
26397,10,1,white the experiment shows that if the color is whi te the less hot the object gets so if brandi and jerry paint it white t he dog would not be as hot if it was black
26398,10,0,light gray this color should make the doghouse a nice co ol temperature cosistantly i say this because in the data table light gr ay's average temp was 45 deg
26399,10,2,black i think this color will effect the dog house by heating it up when there light energy or heat energy inside of it bec ause black got the highest average of 53 c deg
26400,10,0,white its not to dark
26401,10,2,white white would affect the color by not letting the dog house heat up because with the data the result was the darker the color the more heat so the color white would keep the dog house nice and fresh
26402,10,2,dark gray i chose the color dark gray because when it i s cold outside the house will absorb heat and warm up the doghouse so it wont be cold but when it is really hot outside it wont absorb as much energy as the black paint so it will be a little cool
26403,10,2,white white made the jar the coolest on average in the experement at 42 deg c while black on average made the jar the ho ttest at 53 deg c so if you painted the dog house white the temperature inside the dog house should be cooler than if you painted it black dark gray or light gray
26404,10,2,white if your design for your doghouse was to keep the dog out of the heat then you should choose the white because after ten minutes of a lamps heat the white color kept the temperature down to 42 deg c while the black lid kept the temperature to 53 deg c
26405,10,1,white if the color of the doghouse was white then i think the dog that lives there will want to go in the doghouse more ofte n because its not going to be really hot its going to be cool
26406,10,2,light gray light gray because the color is not that dar k but not that light ether for the summer it wont be that hot and in t he winter it wont be that cold ether also the tempetures of the data cam e out that the gray color is right in the middle average of the experime nt
26407,10,1,white this way the doghouse will stay cool since th e jar with the white lid had the average temperature or 42 deg c
26408,10,0,dark gray the greater the increase in the air temperatu re in the glass jar because darker colors absorb more energy
26409,10,2,black it would make it warmer for the dog so it wou ld be warmer inside the doghouse so the dog would not be too cold in the experiment the results show that the darker the color the warmer it is inside
26410,10,2,light gray light gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse one reason i chose this is because when the sun is beating down on the doghouse the dog could overheat also the opposite is true as well if you had a white doghouse it may make the dog very cold the black lid had an average of 53 deg c and the white lid had an average of 42 deg c this makes a grey painted doghouse the best choice
26411,10,1,black i think that black she psint the doghouse bec ause it dark and it could absorb more energy and increase in air tempertu re
26412,10,1,white the test proves white dosent get as hot as ot her colors
26413,10,2,white the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white because white dosent absorb as much heat as d oes darker colors for example in the air temprature expeirament they p ut a dark colord lid over a jar with a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius after ten miniutes the took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c but when they p ut the lighter coverd lid over the jar at a starting point of 24c after 10 miniutes they saw that the jar was an averege of only 42 c so the be st choice would be the color white for your dog house because it will not absorb as much heat and will stay cooler for your dog
26414,10,2,dark gray the dark gray color for a doghouse might be b est to keep the dog warm in the winter with the little sun it receives b ut not overly heated in the summer in the experiment the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with 48 deg a black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog in the investi gation the air temperature of black was at 53 deg the light gray and white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog the air temperatures of the light g ray was 45 deg and of the white was 42 deg this is why i would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse
26415,10,1,white as shown in brandi and jerry's experiment wh ite absorbs less light than the other colors if the doghouse is painted white than the air temperature will be less inside of the doghouse so t he dog will be cooler inside of the doghouse
26416,10,2,white in the testing of which color made the air in side of the jar hottest the black was the hottest then came the dark gr ay than light grey then the white was the coolest so the air inside of the doghouse would be cooler if it was white which would be best for the dog
26417,10,1,white it will make it cooler inside because the whi te coloer will deflect light from the house
26418,10,0,white dark colors atract heat lighter colors reapel heat
26419,10,0,black be geos once you go black u never go back
26420,10,1,white they should choose white because they dont wa nt their dog to get really hot and white wont absorb that much heat so it will stay cool on the inside
26421,10,1,light gray light grey would work good because its almost in the middle and maintains a good temperature so it doesnt get to hot b ut not to cold
26422,10,2,white white is the best color to use for the doghou se this is becasue the color white reflects the most sunlight and theref ore it wont be as hot insdie the house with the white colored jar lid t he average tempurature is 42 deg c the averages for the light gray d ark gray and black lids were 45 deg c 48 deg c and 53 deg c this shows that having the doghouse be white would keep the air cooler and mo re comfortable for the dog
26423,10,2,white it is the brightest color in this selection a nd the darker the color the more energy it will absorb the doghouse wil l usually be humid and hot and dry inside for the dog if alot of the sun' s solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average colum n of the data table by doing so you can see that white had the lowest a verage temperature at 42 deg c while the black had an average temperatu re of 53 deg c dark and light gray were also above white's average mak ing white the best suited color for the doghouse
26424,10,1,light gray it will make it cool on warm and sunny days b ut on winter days it wont be too cold and it will act as both warm and co ld depending on the day
26425,10,0,white in the summer the doghouse would not be to wa rm and not as hot as warm as a doghouse that is black
26426,10,2,black using the results from the experiment the bes t color for the doghouse if you were looking for the doghouse to be warm would be black because in the experiment it shows that black heats up the most in the same amunt of time
26427,10,0,black i think black would be the best color because when it was in the glass bottle after 10 minutes it had the highest scor es
26428,10,1,dark gray brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse da rk gray because then inside of the dog house it would not be too hot or too cold for their dog if they painted the house black it would be too hot the average temperature was 53 deg c and the dark gray average temp erature was 48 deg c light gray and white would make the inside of the doghouse too cold because those temperatures averaged at 45 deg c and 4 2 deg c therefore dark grey is just right
26429,10,1,white i chose white because the dog could go in the dog house and not get to hot from the heat of the sun because white does not catch heat as easaly as black
26430,10,2,white in the experiment they said darker colors aso rb more heat and you do not want more heat in you're dogs house and you dont want you're dog to overheat so i picked white so it stays cool duri ng the summer
26431,10,1,white i say that they should use white because from the data they had from the experiment it shows that darker colors absorb s more energy then any other colors white would not take as much absrob energy as shown in the data table given because it's a light color and it would be better for the dog not to have as much absorb energy in it's ho use
26432,10,1,light gray if you were to paint the dog house light gray the tempature inside the dog house would not be as hot in summer time or not as cold in the winter time as if you were to pick white it would be colder and black it would be hotter and dark gray would be hotter just n ot as much light gray would be just in the middle of all of them
26433,10,2,white i think white might be the best color for the dog house because when it's sunny out the temperature inside the dog hou se will be cooler becasue in the experiment we learned that white i s cooler proving that it absorbes less heat
26434,10,1,white is because on a hot day it wont be as hot in the doghouse if you use white if you use b lack the dog would be to hot
26435,10,1,black it will be the hottest because darker colors absorb more energy
26436,10,1,dark gray this color would make the doghouse warm but n ot too warm and it wont be cold inside either
26437,10,2,light gray i chose the light gray paint because in the summer time the dog house won't be too hot or too cold the light gray rose 21 deg c in ten minutes where as the black rose 29 deg c and th at means that when it's hot outside the tempature in the dog house will b e hot and uncomfortable
26438,10,1,white the inside of the doghouse would be cooler wi th the color white and with black it would be hotter
26439,10,0,black black because it effect lid color on the air temperature and because it absob more energy
26440,10,1,white having a white color for the dog house will effectively keep the dog at a temperature where the sun wouldn't gradually increase the temperature too hot for the dog to live inside dog house according to a experiment on lid color vs air temperature inside glass jar a white lid did not help increase the temperature inside the jar while a grey and black lids effectively increased the temperture over 6 degrees
26441,10,0,dark gray i choose dark gray as the color for the dogho use because the white color would be good for summer but then during the winter the dog would get too cold the black color would be good for win ter but then during summer the dog would get too hot the light gray col or would be good for summer spring and winter but not for fall the dar k gray would be good for summer fall and winter and the dog would proba bly spend most of his her time outside during spring i would paint the d oghouse dark gray
26442,10,2,light gray light gray would be the best color for a dog houise beacuse if the dog is outside and its cold outside the light gray still atractas some warmth to it but not too much for when its hot outsi de in the experiment light gray had the averge of 45 deg c while white had 42 deg c and the black had an avergae of 53 deg c this shows that white would be too cold becuase it would not attract alot of sunlight t he black is too hot by attracting too much sunlight but the light gray at tracts enough sunlight to keep the house cool and warm
26443,10,1,light gray this color might affect the doghouse by makin g the doghouse not too hot and not too cold for the dog a comfortable te mperature for the dog
26444,10,0,black trial 1 54 trial 2 52 trial 3 54 trial 4 53 this color would keep keep it warm when it needs to be war m and keep it cool when it needs to be cool
26445,10,0,white that color might affect the doghouse because the tempurtue will be good for the doghouse
26446,10,1,light gray i choose light gray because in the winter gra y is kinda dark it will be warm and in the summer it will be cool cause of the light gray
26447,10,1,black the color black absorbs more light so the do ghouse will be warmer
26448,10,1,dark gray the darker the color is the hotter the inside of the house will get so i picked dark grey because black might make it too hot when the sun is on it and white would be too cold
26449,10,1,black black would affect the air temperature in the dog house in the experiment the black lid color had on average of 53 deg c this color would greatly effect the dog house in the summer on hot days the black color would attract heat which would be a health issue for the dog
26450,10,0,light gray light gray would be a good color because if y ou used black then that would attract energy from the sun causing the sun to hitthe dog house and the dog will get to hot so if we use light it w ill slightly attract some energy from the sun because the color is a mixt ure between black and white making the dog the right temerature
26451,10,1,light gray it will help yhe dog house becuase in the sum mer it wont be to hot and then in the winter it will kepp it warm a littl e
26452,10,2,black this color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors dark gray's average temperature was 48 d egrees celcius light gray's average temperature was 45 degrees celcius and white's average temperature was 42 degrees celcius
26453,10,1,light gray if you use a light gray paint then the inside of the dog house wont be super hot for the dog
26454,10,0,white it might affect it by the deg c level in th e dog house and it will make it not as cold as the other colors so it a h otter tempature
26455,10,1,dark gray the dark gray could help the dog stay cool in the summer but also stay warm in the winter in the results of the lab the dark gray had 48 degrees all the way through the experiment the dark gray color would be the best color for the dog house
26456,10,1,black how the color might affect the doghouse is by the temperature of the inside of the doghouse with the proven fact by the experim ent that darker colors absorb more heat painting the doghouse the color black will increase the temperature of inside the doghouse in the experi ment brandi and jerry got the results that the color black out of all the colors had the hottest temperature of the inside of the glass jar
26457,10,1,dark gray it makes the house pretty hot so the dog won't get cold but it's not so hot that the dog will get too warm
26458,10,0,light gray becasue it isn't too dark and it isn't too light it's just right for the dogs eyesight
26459,10,1,dark gray that effect would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold
26460,10,2,black if they use the color black the inside air te mpature would be the warmest according to there data
26461,10,1,dark gray i think that a dark gray would be the best co lor to paint the dog house sense dark colors attract solar heat but it all depends on where the dog house will be located for example if yo ur somewhere where its normally hot outside you should paint the house white or light gray but if this dog house is going to be somewhere where its normally cold outside paint it dark gray or black
26462,10,0,black its my favorite color
26463,10,1,light gray i think it wuold be light gray because dogs d ont like to be that warn and not that cold
26464,10,2,white if you paint the dog house white it will sta y nice and cool and won't get too hot because the data showed that when t he lid was white the average temperature 42 deg c was colder than the others when the lid was black the average temperature was highest 53 deg c which is 11 deg more than the white lid's average
26465,10,0,white ti make ti litere
26466,10,1,white i think they should paint the dog house white because in the summer it will keep the doghouse cooler insi de and keep the dog from getting to hot
26467,10,1,light gray light gray might not affect the dog house bec ause in the summer when its really hot it went wont get really hot inside because light gray is not as dark the dog house might just be the right temperture not to hot and not to cold just right
26468,10,1,white it will affect the doghouse because i won't be as hot inside if its painted white but if its painted black or another color it will be hotter inside
26469,10,1,white white would affect the doghouse by making it cooler than any other color shown
26470,10,1,white white will make the dog house as cool as poss ible
26471,10,2,white having a white colored dog house is the best option because its the one that got the lowest temperature in the experim ent which was 42 deg c average and since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best the other colors averages were black 53 deg c dark gray 48 deg c and light gray 45 deg c which are to hot for a dog to be living in
26472,10,0,white this is the best possible paint color for a d oghouse for the summer but for the winter it would be black
26473,10,2,white whtie is the best color to paint the dog hous e because in brandi and jerry's experiment the darker lid's had a higher tempature black had a ending tempature average of 53 deg c and the wh ite lid had a ending tempature average of 42 deg c therefor white wou ld be the better paint color to keep the dog house cooler for the dog
26474,10,1,white the white paint would make it colder in the doghouse on hot summer days
26475,10,0,white less solor energy less hot the dogs house wil l be
26476,10,0,black because it's average is very high and it cou ld do something to it
26477,10,1,black darker colors attract and absorb more light s o if you paint the doghouse black then the sun's rays will hit the house and cause the black paint to absorb the light and keep the dog house warmer
26478,10,1,light gray it will heat the dog house so it is warm and not to hot or too cold because in the data the light gray color was just about the middle
26479,10,2,white the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse allot cooler compare d to the black lid at 53 degrees celcius
26480,10,2,black i chose black because the average inside temp erature after ten minutes was 53 degreee celcius so then the dog house w ould be warmer for the dog
26481,10,2,black if they used black for there dog house there dog would be very warm because it would keep all the heat in there for keeping the dog warm because the black will be traping in the heat that is why people don't wear black on a hot day i can say this because in the data table for black the average temperature was 53 deg and that was the highest temperature there was this is why i think brandi and jerry should use black for there dog house
26482,10,2,white it would make it cooler than the other colors white ended up about 42 deg c while black was about 53 deg c
26483,10,0,white white will affect the doghouse because its average of air temperature inside a glass jar for 10 minutes was 42 deg while light gray was 45 deg dark gray was 48 deg and black was 53 deg
26484,10,0,black because dogs are colored blind and if the dog house is painted black then the dog wouldnt be able to see it
26485,10,2,white white will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse in the experiment white had an average of 42 deg c while the other colors had higher temperature averages
26486,10,2,black the black paint would absorb heat that would keep the doghouse warm the results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after 10 minues
26487,10,1,dark gray i how not mack the dog house black it will be to hot
26488,10,2,white it will make the air cooler becuase it's aver age was 42 it started at 24 so it only went up by 18 and black went up b y 29 because black ended at 53
26489,10,1,dark gray dark gray would be better because you dont wa nt the dog to be cold if it were to live in the dog house but you dont wa nt it to be to warm for the dog
26490,10,2,white white is a very light color but with black i t attracts the sun so inside this doghouse when black it can get hot b ut with the white it can also get warm but not hot as 53 deg c as the black had the white had a average of 42 deg c which is not hot comp ared to 53 deg c
26491,10,1,black the color affects the dog house by the tempat ure inside the doghouse if the color is darker it will be hoter if the co lor is lighter it will he colder and so on and because the doghouse will probaly be outside i chose black so that it is warmer
26492,10,1,light gray it won't be as hot inside of the doghouse ma king it more comfortable for the dog in the hotter months but it will st ill be warm enough that the dog will be comfortable in the colder months
26493,10,1,light gray the color might affect the doghouse because l ight gray will not make it too hot or too cold the temperature will be in the middle
26494,10,2,black this color will help keep the insideof the do ghouse warmer the black colored lid is 9 deg warmer than the white col ored lid
26495,10,2,light gray after being exposed to heat white was the coolest with 42 deg c followed by light gray with 45 deg c dark gray and then black by using light grey the doghouse would stay fairly cool in the summer unlike black and absorb a fair abount of heat in the cold winter unlike white
26496,10,2,black well the darker the color is the more heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because the dog is outsid e so the dog will stay warm at a good temperature on the table of the expirement it shows that having a black lid on trial one gave it 54 degrees on white on trial one it was only about 42 degrees 12 degree difference
26497,10,1,white it will not make it hot during the summer so the dog can cool him self
26498,10,2,white i would choose white because it will keep the dog cool in the summer time because the white lid had an average tempera ture of 42 deg c whereas the light grey had an average of 45 deg c the dark grey had an average of 48 deg c and the black had an average of 53 deg c
26499,10,2,black if they use black paint on the doghouse then the doghouse will be hotter than with any other color in the experiment the black lid's average temperature was 53 degrees and all the other colo rs were more cold
26500,10,2,white the color white would affect the doghouse by cooling it off because in the experiment the air temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 degrees in comparison to the air temperature in the jar with the blakc lid which was 53 degrees that makes black 9 degrees hotter then white
26501,10,0,white whit wouldnt arelly affect it cause in the wi nter there is not much sun so the color would make no difference but in t he summer it would be the same because sun does not affect the color whit e especailly in the heat
26502,10,1,black becuase when it gets hot outside the sun atracts black and then it will heat up the doghouse and the dog house would get to hot and then the dog would really hot
26503,10,0,white white would probably be the best choice to paint the dog house it would stay at a temperature of about 42 deg c this color doesn't attract heat like black or dark colors do so i think this would be the best choice
26504,10,0,light gray i have know idea
26505,10,2,white white will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors this is because the average air temperature of the jar w ith the white lid was 42 deg c the light grey lid was 45 deg c the da rk grey lid was 48 deg c and the balck lid was 53 deg c the differenc e between the darkest black lid and the white lid was 11 deg c
26506,10,2,white white so the doghouse stays cooler because ac ording to the table white makes the temp inside the jar the coolest
26507,10,1,black black would affest the dog house becasue the sun attracts to black very easily and will make the dog house very hot on the inside
26508,10,1,white it will make it cooler for the dog and the do g wont over heat and become thirsty all the time
26509,10,1,white the white paint color would keep the inside of the doghouse more cooler than the other colors because lighter colors absorb less heat
26510,10,1,black they should do the dog house black because th e aveerage in the expierament was 53 deg and that is around the temepat ure that a dog would wanna stay in while its sleeping also beacuase whe n its sunny the black darkens the dog house while the dog sleeps
26511,10,1,dark gray i picked ths color because if it is hot day the dog wouldnt want his house black because it will just make it too hot for him then if its white it will just be too cool for him so i that dark gray will be just warm enough for hiom
26512,10,2,light gray the best color for brandi and jerry to paint their dog house would probably light gray this is because while the lid that absorbed the most heat black had an average temperature of 53 deg c and the coolest white had an average temperature of 42 deg c the light gr ey lid had an average temperature of 45 deg c a medium between the two which would make the doghouse retain heat in the winter and keep it cool in the summer
26513,10,1,dark gray can keep warm temperature for the dog in the winter but not so hot in the summer
26514,10,0,white it will be better because the whiter the colo r the better beacause it will not absorb that much enrgy
26515,10,1,white this color would affect the doghouse because the color white reflects light while as the color black or darker colors absorb light so with the choice of white the doghouse would not heat u p as much as it would if brandi and jerry were to use a darker color
26516,10,2,black this color will keep the inside of the doghou se warmer dark colors absorb more heat energy in the experiment w ith the jar the air was always warmer in the jar with a black lid rather than jars with lighter color
26517,10,0,black this color might affect the dog house becaus e black absorbs the most energy that is given it is shown in the results that black lid color has an average of 53 deg c
26518,10,1,light gray i chose light gray because it would stay cool in summer and a little warmer in the winter
26519,10,2,black using black as the color of the doghouse will make it hotter in the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest this would help the dog stay warmer in the winter it would be the best color choice as long as the owners live in a cold climate
26520,10,2,light gray the light colro of the dog house will hlp to keep the doghouse cool and ideal in hot temperatures but will also absor b enough thermal energy from the sun to had a semi warm environment whil e the black lid color in the experiment created an average jar air temper ature of 53 deg that temperature is very hot and a dag would feel very uncomfortable within that environment however if we look at the white lid it had an average temperature of 42 deg that temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough thermal evergy on days that it is cooler however the light gray lid had an average of 45 deg in the tr ials its temperature was msot ideal and it would create the most balance d environmetn for the dog to live in
26521,10,2,black black would make the doghouse warm inside in the experiment the average temperature for black jars was 53 deg c
26522,10,1,white the color white would affect the doghouse bec ause the tempuature will be cooler
26523,10,1,light gray it would keep the dog house at a good tempera ture not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house isnt very cold
26524,10,1,light gray it will put some heat in but will also keep i t cool in the day
26525,10,2,white white because white absorbs less heat energy from the sun in the experiment brandi and jerry discovered that darker co lors affect how much energy they can absorb so that's why white is the b est color to choose to make a new doghouse because it doesn't absorb that much energy from the sun
26526,10,2,black black darker colored paint will absorb the energy from the light source lamp and keep it heated up inside the dog house like the air temperature experiment the black lid color had 54 deg c while the white lid color had a 42 deg c proving that the darker the color there is the more heat is absorbed keeping it more warm
26527,10,1,dark gray dark grey would be the best color for them to make the dog house because the air temperature wouldn't be too hot or to o cold for the dog also the temperature stayed the same for all the tria ls which means that it won't change no matter how hot the weather may be
26528,10,2,dark gray i would choose to paint the doghouse dark gra y because the color would not be too dark or too light so it wouldn't mak e the doghouse too warm or cold the data supports this because the jar w ith the dark gray lid had a temperature that was more in between that of the black and white jars when the light gray jar had a temperature that was closer to the white jar making it to cold
26529,10,2,white it would affect the doghouse by it would stay cool in there in the experamint white had the lowest temputure
26530,10,0,dark gray not a lot just a agents the sun
26531,10,1,white it will make it warm inside the doghouse beca use the light did not penetrate it alot so the thermometer did not go as high
26532,10,1,dark gray it will keep it a nice temperature not too wa rm and not too cold
26533,10,0,white it wont be as hot for the dog
26534,10,0,white i think white because it would keep the most heat out
26535,10,1,black the color black would effect the doghouse bec ause the sun is attracted to the color black also in the data table the color black has the highest results on the temperture
26536,10,2,dark gray this color will allow the doghouse to be reli tively warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog c omfterble the average temperature of the dark gray lid was 48 deg c 5 deg c cooler than the average temperature for the hottest lid which was the black lid and therefore shows that the doghouse will be able to sustain a comt erble temperature
26537,10,2,white the dog house should be white because the col or white deflects the heat waves so the inside of the dog house would be cooler if the dog house was painted black it would absorb more heat wa ves and then the dog house would get hotter
26538,10,1,light gray it will make the dog house warmer in the wint er but will not make it too warm in the summer
26539,10,1,white paint the doghouse white if where you live is hot because black attracts too much heat paint the doghouse black if y ou live somewhere cold because the heat can't affect that
26540,10,2,white white might make the doghouse cooler beacuse white in the experiment showed it would increase the temperature by 20 or so degrees c when black increased by 30 or so degrees c
26541,10,1,white i picked the white color because the affect o f white color paint makes the temperature for the dog house to be alot mo re cooler so if the dog house is white the dog's temperature will be alot more cooler than the other colors their is
26542,10,0,black the color might afferct the doghouse because mybe the dog dasent like the color they put on the dogs house or myebe is to dark or to briet for the dog and calculate and rec ord the average air temperature for each lid color
26543,10,2,black i chose black because black is going to keep the dog house warmer if they paint the dog house white the light will just reflect off butt if they choose black then they will keep the warm i know this because on the experiment they did with the lamp the average temperature with the black lid was 53 deg c but the average temperature with the white lid was 42 deg c so black would be the best color for the dog house
26544,10,2,black this would make the doghouse very hot and unc omfortable because as shown in the expirament black attracts heat bring ing more thermal energy to the dog house than other colors such as white
26545,10,2,white the color white might affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler because the black had an average of 53 deg c the dar k gray had an average temperature of 48 deg c and the light gray had a n average temperature of 45 deg c finally the white had an average te mperature of 42 deg c so the black jar had the highest temperature da rkest color and the white had the lowest temperature brightest color so inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
26546,10,0,black the color black might affect the dog house be cause black is the drakest color out of the's four colors
26547,10,1,white it should be white beacuse if its a dark color it would attract motre energy heat
26548,10,1,black the black is going to make it a lot warmer in side the dog house
26549,10,1,white white because it will not tack or exorb the h eat
26550,10,1,black it might affect the doghouse because its a dark color and it will be darker and hotter in the doghouse sence dark colors absorb more engery
26551,10,2,black this color paint black will attract more he at to the inside of the dog house we know this because the averge of hea t in side the jar on bradi and jerry exsperiment was 54 deg c for black paint and 42 deg c for the white paint so you can see that if you wer e wanting to keep the inside of the doghouse warm you would want to paint it black
26552,10,1,black the color black might affect the inside of th e doghouse because if the color of the house is darker it will increase t he temp of the house inside
26553,10,1,black it will make the temperature inside of the do ghouse hotter
26554,10,2,white painting the doghouse white will make it so t hat the temperature inside will be cooler because as tests show white c ompared to black can have a temperature difference of 12 degrees celsius
26555,10,1,white the white color may affect the dog house by making it more cooler than solid colors because it reflects the light insted of absorbing more light energy caused form the sun
26556,10,2,white white reflect the light when you use white c olor temperature will lower than when you use dark color in the expieren ce when you use white the temperature was42 deg c but when you use black the temperature was 53 deg c when you use white color temperature was 9 deg c lower than when you use dark color
26557,10,2,light gray in the test results the white at the average of 42 deg c was the coolest while black at the average of 53 deg c was the hottest while light gray is averiging 45 deg c it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog
26558,10,2,dark gray during each trial it stayed 48 deg c which i snt to hot or cold it might affect it buy whether its snowing or really cold outside he wont freeze because the color is trying to attract some k ind of heat for when its hot it would attract some sunlight though but n ot as much as black so its fairly compfortable for a dog
26559,10,1,black black would be the best color to use so that the dog will stay warm the average tempature using black was 53 25 deg c
26560,10,1,black painting the doghouse black will result in th e temperature inside to be higher the darker the color is on the outside will absorb more heat energy into the doghouse this will help because i t will keep the dog warmer
26561,10,1,black it would affect the doghouse because the colo r black is going to make the doghouse hotter
26562,10,2,light gray this color might affect the inside of the dog house because the result in the experiment was that the lighter the color the lower temperature i chose light gray because on sunny days when the dog need shade or cooling off it can just go into the doghouse where it will be the perfect temperature cold but not freezing
26563,10,0,black the color that i chose that may effect the in side of the dog house because from heat it will give the dog shade for th e dog house from the expirement it shows when they put th e dark black lid on top of the gar it hows that the temerature decreases after they put the thermometer in the glass gar
26564,10,0,black will absord more energy
26565,10,2,white it would be the best because it would keep th e dog cool because what had the lowest average temperature
26566,10,1,white the white absorbs less heat and keeps cooler
26567,10,2,white white will keep the doghouse cooler because it will be only 42 deg c inside then if brandi and jerry were to use black it would be 54 deg c inside of the doghouse because black absobes light and white reflects the light so the heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse
26568,10,2,light gray light gray because it wouldn't be that hot in the summer time and in would not be that cold becaue in the results the average for light grey was 45 deg and that in perfect tempature
26569,10,1,light gray i chose the light gray because on average it was 45 deg c so it wouldn't be too hot o too cold for the dog
26570,10,1,white the lighter the color is the more light ener gy it reflects if most of the light energy is reflected the less hotter it will be inside the doghouse or whatever you're painting
26571,10,0,white the color of the dog house affected the temperature inside
26572,10,2,white i would chose white because that will make it the coldest and if i were a dog i wouldnt want it to be really hot id want it to be as cold as i could get it for black the average was the wa rmest with 53 deg c for dark gray it was in the middle with 48 deg c for light gray it was also in the middle with 45 deg c and white was the coldest wtih 42 deg c the white paint will keep the doghouse less insul ated and more open it will keep it so its not so hot and not so cold be cause 42 deg c isnt cold or hot its in the middle
26573,10,1,white white would be the best color this is becaus e on average it had the lowest tempature inside so it asorbed or blocked the most heat it had an averge of 42 degrees while black had an average of 53 degrees
26574,10,1,black it would increase the temerature more than an y colors selected
26575,10,0,black black
26576,10,2,white i think they should go with white so the dog house doesnt get to hot because the black paints number was 53 for the av erage and the litest color whites average was 42 so i think that the colo r that would be best for the dog house would be white beacuse it re flects less heat from the other three colors which were black dark gre li ght grey and white
26577,10,1,white it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool er
26578,10,0,white because white is the the color that regects a ll light there for keeping the light rays from soaking in causing heat
26579,10,2,light gray the lighter the color of the doghouse the co oler the temperature is inside and the darker the color of the dog house the warmer it is inside because when the lid color was black the aver age temperature was 53 deg c but when the lid color was white the aver age temperature was 42 deg c which had a difference of 11 deg
26580,10,0,black because black is a dark color and it will atr ackt te sun so then the tempeture is going to change
26581,10,1,light gray they don't want it to be too cold but not to o hot either a light gray dog house won't be too cold for the dog but a lso not too hot because it'll just warm the dog house up 11 deg c that isn't too much so the dog won't suffocate but it won't freeze to death either
26582,10,0,white assuming that you want to keep the doghouse c ool i would choose to paint it white because it reflects the least amoun t of light
26583,10,2,black the average temperature inside the glass jar with a black lid was 53 deg c with a dark gray lid the average tempera ture was 48 deg c with a light gray lid the average temperature was 45 deg c with a white lid the average temperature was 42 deg c the sta rting temperature was 24 deg c so the average temperature for the black lid raised the starting temperature by 29 deg c the average temperatur e for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11 deg warmer than the whit e lid therefore to keep the inside of the doghouse warm and also to kee p the dog warm in cold temperatures black would be the best color becau se it had the highest average temperature inside the glass jar
26584,10,1,light gray i believe that the light gray color would be optimal for the doghouse it would keep the temperature inside to a pleas ant level not too hot or cold the average temperature of the jar with t he light gray lid after ten minutes was 45 deg c
26585,10,2,light gray light gray will affect the doghouse because based on the data the light gray color was the second coolest at an avera ge of 45 deg this will help because during the summer when it is hot it will keep the doghouse cooler but it will also help during the winte r and keep the dog house warmer
26586,10,1,light gray this color would be the best for the doghouse because if you were to use black the dog would get really hot because t he darker the color the more energy it will attract and make it hotter i f you use white then it doesn't get as much energy so the dog may get col d because the lighter the color the less energy you will attract light g ray is inbetween so it will attract some energy but not to much
26587,10,2,white the color white may affect the doghouse in a better way than the other three colors because according to the dat a table the lid color black dark gray light gray all had higher air te mperatures the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar therefore white would be a better color for the doghouse becau se the air temperature inside of the doghouse would be less than the othe r three colors
26588,10,1,black the color will increase the air tempeature in side the dog house
26589,10,1,white this would affect the dog house because in th e summer the dog would stay cool and not get hot but in the winter it cou ldnt get colder than if the dog house was black
26590,10,1,white the inside would be cooler because dark color s absorb heat and white refects it
26591,10,2,white white will keep the doghouse more chill than black or dark gray cause of their hot temps when white has a temp of 42 degrees celcius keeping the doghouse nice and cold
26592,10,1,white i think the color for the doghouse should be the color white because it doesnt attract heat and if we were to choose the black color inside the doghouse it would be hot the black color's average is 53 and the white colors average is 42
26593,10,0,black becouse the dog house would look filthy
26594,10,1,black black will affect the dog house and make it h otter because black atracts the sun
26595,10,0,dark gray dark grey because their all 48in all differen t procdures
26596,10,1,dark gray the best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray because it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog inside dark gray was the color that absorbed the second highest temperature so the temperature will keep the dog warm but not too hot
26597,10,1,light gray light gray because it didnt heat up that much but it did a little so the dogs house wouldnt get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter
26598,10,0,white the color should be white because so its not super duper hot when the suns out
26599,10,1,white using white to paint the doghouse will affect its temperature because it absorbs the least amount of heat from the sun refurring back to the hot lamp experiment we know that whi te absorbs the least amount of heat because in all 3 trials the average amount of heat absorbed by the white lid was 42 deg after 10 minutes t hat is only 18 deg c more than the temperature it started at 24 deg c this is how we would know which paint to use for the dog house
26600,10,2,black the color black will make a higher temperature in the dog house then dark gray light gray or white because darker colors absorb more energy this is supported by the data of the ex periment hot lamp the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the black lid was 53 degrees celsuis the average temperature for the dark gray lid inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis the a verage temperature for the light gray lid inside the glass jar after 10 m inutes was 45 degrees celsuis and the average temperature inside the gla ss jar after 10 minutes for the white lid was 42 degrees celsuis this da ta shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the do g house
26601,10,0,dark gray the color affect the dog house because with dark gray the temperature is kept the same instead of varying from one temp to the other plus dog dont want it to be too cold in there dog house so i figured they want a temperature that will keep them warm and kinda chill
26602,10,1,black it will make the dog house really hot
26603,10,2,black by using black for the color of the dog house the inside of the house will be warmer than the other colors because d arker colors absorb more heat according to brandi and jerry's chart it i s true because after 10 minutes the black lit had the warmest air inside the jar
26604,10,1,dark gray it will keep same temp and will be too hot nor cold
26605,10,1,black it will make the doghouse warmer inside which would be good for the winter time so the dog isnt cold and miserable
26606,10,1,white the color will affect the dog house because i t will make it alot cooler in the dog house when the sun is out and it wi ll look better
26607,10,0,white they paint the color whit because it at tracts less sun light
26608,10,1,white white paint color because that way the dog wo nt be hot instead it would be cool
26609,10,1,black it wil heat the dog house up more than the ot her colors
26610,10,0,light gray eeee
26611,10,1,black if the doghouse is black it will absorb more energy then the other colors this is apparent in the test where the st arting temperature for the glass jar was 24 deg c and the black jar we nt up to 53 deg c while the white jar only went up to 42 deg c
26612,10,1,light gray it will make it slighty cooler than hot it w ill affect the dog house as making the dog house warm on cold days and not to hot on hot days
26613,10,1,white that color would allow the doghouse to be coo ler and not so hot and stuffy
26614,10,1,white white because it dosnt obsorb as much heat as dark lids
26615,10,2,light gray the color of light gray might affect the dog house by keeping it the right temprature not too cold or too hot becaus e the darker the color the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the c ooler it gets according too the data in which i got the information
26616,10,1,white the wite color will make the dog house cooler so it wont be hot and stuffy
26617,10,1,black if you had a dog house black then all the the rmal enegy will go to it and be warmer for your dog inside the dog house would be warm for your dog to live in as it shows in the data black was with the highest temperture
26618,10,1,white if the dog house was painted black and was exposed to the sun for to long it would get to ht now if it was painted white the house wont get to hot
26619,10,1,dark gray dark gray because the temperature wont be to hot or to cold it would be just the right temperature for the dog
26620,10,1,light gray the light gray only attracts 45 degrees celci us and that is pretty warm during the winter the dog won't freeze and du ring the summer it won't sweat a lot
26621,10,1,dark gray the color will affect the dog house by keepin g it warm in winter and not so hot in summer
26622,10,1,white white because if not you could over heat the dog yu want to keep it cool
26623,10,2,white a white paint on the dog house might work the best for summer and according to the data table the white color's avera ge temperature was the lowest so it will be good for days when it's hot
26624,10,0,white white so it doesnt get hot in there when its summer cause darker colors attract heat
26625,10,2,light gray this color might affect the doghouse because when the weather is warm outside the doghouse will stay cool but also be a bit warm also when the weather is cold outside the doghouse wil l be warm but aslo a bit cool i know this because when the light g ray lid was used on the jar the temperature inside the jar was average an d stayed cool however the lid was also a bit warm the lowes t temperature inside the glass jar with the light gray lid on was 44 deg c while the highest was 46 deg c which if this is the sa me with the doghouse will make the doghouse feel like a great temperature
26626,10,1,white it would make it cooler inside because white reflects the sun rays and black absorbs them
26627,10,1,black the darker the color the warmer it will be i nside of the doghouse becuase darker colors absorb more energy
26628,10,2,light gray the best color to paint a doghouse would be l ight gray because according to the selection light gray was cooler than b lack by 8 deg and it was 3 deg hotter than white which would allow th e dog to be cooler in the summer but still warm in the winter
26629,10,1,black the inside of the doghouse would be much warm er inside the doghouse then the other colors the black attracts more hea t
26630,10,2,white white paint would be best because it would ke ep the interior of the dog house cool the white lid had an average of 42 deg c while the black lid got up to 53 deg c unless you want your d og to be too hot in his or her doghouse i suggest you paint it white al so white looks much better on houses than black dark grey or light gre y
26631,10,1,dark gray the dark gray might effect the iside by the temputer because the starting temputer in the exsperiment was 24 degrees and it ended up being 48 degrees each time
26632,10,2,light gray using a light gray paint on a dog house will help keep it warm inside on cold days and cool inside on warm days so the dog is always comfortable i would pick light gray for the color because it had an average temperature of 45 deg c inside the glass jar and that is a nice even temperature for cold and warm days
26633,10,1,black they should paint the dog house black because that on avergage had the highest temperature of 53 deg c which was 5 deg c higher than the second warmest roof color of dark gray and 11 deg c higher t han the coldest roof color white
26634,10,1,dark gray it wont be too hot or too cold
26635,10,0,dark gray dark gray
26636,10,2,dark gray the white paint would reflect all of the ligh t rays therefore keeping the dog house cooler for the dog to escape the heat the black lid had an average of 53 deg c air temperature in side the jar after 10 minutes but the white lid had and average of 42 deg c air temperature inside the jar after 10 minutes this is a difference of 11 deg c the white dog house would keep a dog cooler than any other colo r of paint
26637,10,2,white the color white will affect the dog house by in the summer when it is hotter outside the white wont absorbe to much h eat keeping the dog house cooler the average temperature for the whute lip was 42 the coolest temperater and the average for black was 53 the highest the lower the number the cooler it is white would be the best choice for the doghouse
26638,10,1,black black is the best color because it increases the air temperature so the dog won't be cold
26639,10,2,light gray using light gray would keep the tempurature a t an even or equal rate if it was cold it wouldn't keep it as warm but not super cold either if it was hot outside the dog house would keep s orta cool but not extremely hot either the average of black is a high a t 53 degrees which is super hot then white would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees
26640,10,0,white the white paint will keep the dog house warm in the winter but won't be too hot in the summer the average temperture of the white lid was 42 deg c this way the dog will be comfortable in the house with the white paint color
26641,10,1,light gray light gray might affect the doghouse because it will absorb enery making the inside warm for the dog since the color doesn't absorb all of the energy the doghouse will still be cool compar ed to having the paint black and keeping all of the energy in light gray paint will absorb only a certain amount of energy
26642,10,1,black white because it was less heat in 10min also the temputers only got to around 40 45 deg
26643,10,1,light gray light gray because it would keep the dog hous e warm and still a little bit cool for the dogs temperature the temperat ure stays to an average of 45 deg c
26644,10,2,white white paint will keep the inside of the dodho use cool because in their expirment the tempature of the white was 42 deg c it will keep the dog comfortable
26645,10,1,black in the summer it can make the inside of the d og house hot
26646,10,0,white dark colors will seem confusing just keep it white
26647,10,2,white brandi and jerry should design a doghouse wit h the color white because the white lid's average air temperature i n the jar was only 42 deg c the lowest temperature of all the lids th is would make the doghouse have a lower temperature when exposed to light to keep the dog cooler as you can see the average air temperature in the jar for the white lid was only 42 deg c as compared to the black lid which had an average of 53 deg c this is an increase in 11 deg c a clear in crease of air temperature in the jar from the white to the black lid and therefore showing that with the white paint the air temperature within t he doghouse when exposed to light will be the lowest compared to all othe r paint colors tested
26648,10,1,white the color will reflect most of the heat and t he inside of the doghouse will stay cooler in the experament the temper ature of the jar with the white lid only was raised an average of 16 deg c
26649,10,2,white by painting the doghouse white the temperatu re in the doghouse will not be that high according to the experiment us ing a white lid will keep the temperature inside the jar low so by paint ing the doghouse white the temperature in the doghouse will stay low
26650,10,1,dark gray this color will absorb enough energy to where the air temperture is comfortable and not very cold or very hot
26651,10,1,white the best color for the doghouse will be white because of the results both brandi and jerry did white seem to be the color that is way more cooler than any other colors by this i mean in average tempeture for the color white was 42 deg c which means that the dog will feel freash being inside the doghouse every day it not to cold but not to warm either
26652,10,1,light gray black holds heat in so it would be to hot and white hardly holds any heat so light gray can still hold heat while giving the dog that nice cool feeling
26653,10,2,light gray brandi and jerry should paint their dog house light gray because it won't absorb as much heat energy as the darker colors in the data is shows that the black lid got the hottest 53 deg c while the light gray lid only reached 45 deg c it will still collect heat to keep the doghouse warm but not as much as the darker colors
26654,10,1,light gray light gray is a good color because it will ke ep the inside of the dog house not soo hott and not soo cold it will keep it warm when the sun hits the god house it will not make it really hot a s it would if it were black or dark gray
26655,10,2,black i chouse black becase black makes it hoter nd that will affect the doghouse by making it hotter in the expiriment i t showed that black is hotter
26656,10,0,white it won't effect it at all becuase white don't asorb to much energy and won't cuase any heat like black will
26657,10,1,black if they use the darkest color available then it absorbs the heat energy better so that when the dog uses the dog house it will be warm
26658,10,2,white the paint color that they should use is white this is because the average temperature of the white lid was 42 deg while the average temperatures for the other colors were 45 48 and 53 deg this shows that the white lid was 11 deg degrees color on average than the black lid therefore the dog would stay cooler and more comfortable in t he white house wheras he could become too hot in the black one
26659,10,1,light gray it wont make the dog hot or cold because it's in between the highest tempature would be to hot because its 54 deg an d the lowest would be to cold which is 41 deg and light gray is in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too hot or cold
26660,10,0,black if the dog house had a black roof it would benefit the dog in all kinds of weather for example in the winter time or when it is cold out the black roof keeps all of the dog's body heat in the house instead of wasting it and in the summer when it's hot he'll be outside playing and his doghouse temperature won't matter that much
26661,10,1,black it would make the doghouse warmer
26662,10,1,light gray the doghouse would not get too hot
26663,10,0,light gray you dont want the dog to hot so make it so it will be cooler inside it will be about 45 deg c
26664,10,1,white white will keep the dog cool in the summer s o the dog house wont be super hot it will be cool enough to be in comfurt ably for the dog in the winter it will just be a normal temperature
26665,10,1,white white because it holds the least amount of he at
26666,10,0,light gray well i pick light gray because i wouldnt wan t too much energy in my dogs house if i had to pick a color most dogs g oes in their house soo they can either cool off or to relax
26667,10,0,light gray light gray will be the best color to paint fo r the dog house because it wouldn't attract a lot of heat like the color black and dark gray would
26668,10,0,dark gray the light grey color of the dog house would m ake it nuetral inside because it stayed the same throughout each experime nt
26669,10,1,black the sun absorbs more energy in the color mak ing the inside of the doghouse hot amp warm
26670,10,1,dark gray i think it should be dark gray becuase when i ts summer the color will absorb heat so he cant say nice and warm and coo l at the same time
26671,10,2,black if they painted the doghouse black then it w ill be hotter inside the doghouse because the darker the color the more heat it will absorb example the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar
26672,10,1,white the best color to paint a doghouse is white because white keeps the doghouse less warmer
26673,10,1,black a black doghouse will hold in heat so the dog wont get cold a white dog house will make it colder than all of the oth er colors
26674,10,1,white the darker the color is the hotter it will be inside the lighter the color is it will not be as no t inside
26675,10,2,white the color white will effect the inside of the doghouse because it will keep it cooler in the summer when it hot for example when the white lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to abou t 42 deg c but when the black lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 53 deg c
26676,10,2,white white will attract less heat i say this bec ause it had the lowest average of 42 deg thats 1 deg less than gray 6 deg less that dark grey and 11 deg less than black
26677,10,1,light gray well if the color is to dark then the doghous e would be to hot so use a color the might not make the dohouse to
26678,10,0,black i think black would be the best for the color of a dog house because darker color aborb more energy and black is the d arkest one
26679,10,0,dark gray brandi and jerry should pant their doghouse d ark gray i think they should paint the doghouse dark g ray because in the experiment hot lamp the average of the averages in tha t experiment was 57 and the closest temperature of the averages in that experiment is the dark gray lid
26680,10,0,white because in the graph is says the average is 4 2 and thats why i picked white cause different chemical
26681,10,2,white the color white will affect the dog house by changing the temperature and making it much cooler in the dog house in the experiment it showed that the color white was much colder thanth e othercolors they testedit was an average of 42 when black was 53c
26682,10,1,black the color will keep the doghouse temperature warmer the black color will absorb the heat of the day and keep the dogh ouse warm at night
26683,10,1,white white would be the best because then the dog would not get too hot
26684,10,2,black the color black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse this is modeled in the experiment because when the lid on the jar was black it had an average inside air temperature of 53 deg c and when the lid color was white the air temperature inside was only an avera ge of 42 deg c so this shows that when the color black is used instead of white you will have an average air temperature increase of 11 deg c
26685,10,2,black in the expirement the jar with the black lid was on average 53 deg c after being exposed to the lamp for ten minuets the dark grey lid was only 48 deg c 5 deg c less than that of the bl ack lid the jar with a white lid was only 42 deg c 11 deg c less than the jar with the black lid to warm up the dog house by just the sunligh t brandi and jerry should paint the dog house black to increase the tempe rature within the dog house compared to the results with the jars the b lack paint would absord the sunlight and warm up the dog house more than painting it white as with the jars expirement the black lid warmed up th e jar 11 deg c more than the jar with the white lid
26686,10,2,white i would choose white because white does not absorb a lot of light so there for when iit is hot outside your dog will not get to hot inside of its doghouse i choose the color white because in the experiment it shows that the average temperature for the white lid was 42 and for the black lid it was 53 that is an 11 deg c difference between the two colors so for a dog house i highly considered it being w hite
26687,10,2,light gray the light gray will make the dogs house not t oo cold and not too hot for the dog the average tempature would probably be around 40 50 deg because the light gray lid on the jar had an avera ge 45 deg c but a dog house is a different size from a jar so the tempa ture will vary a little
26688,10,2,white the best color for the dog house is white this is because acording to brandies and jerrys experiment the white dog house gives the least amount of heat into the dog house for the black dog house the average temperature would be 53 deg c for the dark grey dog house the average temperature would be 48 deg c for the light grey dog house the teperature would be 45 deg c and the white dog house would have a temerature 42 deg c acording to this data the best color for a dog house would be white
26689,10,1,white if the dark the color the hotter it gets why not choose white to keep the dog nice and cool in some ways
26690,10,0,white white is the best color for the dog house bec ause darker colors absorb more heat when its warm or hot out but white r eflects all of that heat energy
26691,10,2,dark gray the reason that i selected dark gray as the o ptimal color for the doghouse is becauseout of all the colors dark gray seemed to be the middle tempurature this tempurature will affect the dog house by making it hotter in the winter when the sun shines on it and c ooler then black in the summer because it is a lighter shade than black this will occur from the dark gray paint because in the experiment the use of the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 53 deg the use of a white lid in the experiment made the air tempur ature inside the jar an average of 42 deg the use of a light gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 45 deg and the u se of a dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48 deg t his shows that dark gray is the middle tempurature and ideal for a dogho use because its tempurature was 6 deg hotter than the coolest tempurat ure and 5 deg cooler then the hottest tempurature making dark gray me dium in tempurature and optimal for a dog house
26692,10,1,dark gray that color dark gray might affect the dog h ouse by absorbing heat cause it is a dark color but not as dark black so it won't absorb so munch heat
26693,10,2,white the best paint color for the dog house is whi te because the white color for the lid does not get as hot as the other c olor so itt wont be really hot inside the dog house acording to the air temperature black average was 53 c deg dark gray average 48 c deg lig ht gray average 45 c deg and the white average 42 c deg
26694,10,1,white i picked white because it will make the dog h ouse colder even when the sun hits it
26695,10,2,white i would choose to paint the dog house white the reason that i would paint the dog house white is because the inside o f the dog house would then be cooler rather than if you were painting it black the average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42 deg c rather then when using black after 10 minutes it was 53 deg c this has an overwhelming difference of 11 deg c after just 10 minutes
26696,10,2,black this color black will help the dog house stay become warmer since the dog house is outside and for the most part its pretty cold outside the dog house should be black so that the dog who lives in the dog house can stay warm black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better after the 10 minutes in the experiment black was the darkest color and had an average temperature of 53 degrees celcius after the 10 minutes in the experiment white was the lightest color and had an average temperature of 42 degrees celcius so this proves that the darker the color the more energy it will absorb making the object warmer
26697,10,0,black the color will keep the dog house cooler in t he hot sumer
26698,10,1,dark gray dark gray because it will attrac enough heat to keep it warm in the dog house
26699,10,0,white i pick this color because its so bright
26700,10,0,dark gray the color wuld keep the dog house at a even t empature but it wouldnt really matter because its not a closed system th e jar had a lid so it left in heat but a dog house would let the heat ou t so the dog house is a open system
26701,10,2,white the tempreture inside the white doghouse will be much cooler then the air tempreture outside because in the experimen t the results from all the testing showed that the white colored lid was much cooler the the rest of the colors used so it would be more reasona ble to use the white colored paint to paint the doghouse
26702,10,1,light gray it will keep it warm in the winter but in the summer it would keep it cool because it is a light gray
26703,10,2,black if they choose to paint the dog house black it will affect it by absorbing more heat energy in the investigation th e average temperature for the black lid was 53 deg c versus the white wh ich had an average of 42 deg c therefore if brandi and jerry paint t he dog house black it will absorb more heat energy than the other colors
26704,10,2,light gray the best paint color for the dog house would be light grey this because the light grey would keep the dog house not a s hot during like the summer and warm enough during the winter from bra ndi and jerry's previous experiment you can see with darker colors on th e lids like black and dark grey it made the jar temperature hotter so if you used it on the dog house it would make it too warm inside with the l ight grey it would be not to hot or cold another choice would be the whi te but that might make the dog house to cold in the winter so light grey is the best choice
26705,10,1,white it asorb less heat
26706,10,1,black the color would keep the dog house warmer bec use the average was 53 minutes after the light was turned off so the dog would stay warmer compared to white which was only and average of 42 min utes after the light turned off
26707,10,2,light gray light gray would be the best color for the do ghouse because it would not be too hot or too cold because in the expiram ent the jar with light gray lid had an average temperature of 45 deg c after 10 minutes under the heat lamp which was not as cold as the white l id 42 deg c and the light grey lid did not have as hot of an average a ir temperature after 10 minutes under the heat lamp as the dark gray lid 48 deg c or the black lid which was 53 deg c with the light grey roo f the dog would not get too hot or too cold in it's doghouse
26708,10,2,white it was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature it was 42 deg c 43 deg c 41 deg c and 42 deg c
26709,10,2,black the color black might affect the inside of t he doghouse because the color black absorbs more energy compared to the o ther colors i think this because in the data from the experiment the av erage air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes for the lid color black was 53 deg c the dark gray lid colors average air temperatu re inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 48 deg c the air temperat ure for light gray was 45 deg c and the average air temperature for the lid color white was 42 deg c overall the conclusion you could draw fr om that data is that the lid color black did absorb more energy than the other colors in the experiment the black lid had a difference in average s from the coldest air temperature the white lid by 11 deg c
26710,10,0,light gray maybe something else was alredy that color
26711,10,0,black black might affect it because the darker the color the the more energy it absorbs
26712,10,0,light gray they would choose light gray because they want the dog house to be the right tempature for the dog to stay in without being to hot and light gray is the perfect temapture for the dog
26713,10,1,white that color will effect the doghouse because t he doghouse will not be hot in the summer it will stay cool in the there
26714,10,1,black black if you live in a cold place and want th e dog house to stay warm
26715,10,1,dark gray in winter the doghouse will stay warm in the summer the doghouse will stay cool
26716,10,1,black in the summer the dog house will be hot but in the winter the dog house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat
26717,10,1,white i choose white because if it was black dark g ray or light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hot ness
26718,10,0,dark gray because dogs can only see light gray or dark gray and its more easyer for him to see his dog house
26719,10,0,black the color might affect the dog house because it is a dark color
26720,10,2,dark gray i think that brandi and jerry should use dark grey for the dog house paint color dark grey would keep the temperature between the highest and the lowest temperature dark grey would be the bes t because the black dog house would get to hot for the dog at an average at 53 deg c and the white dog house would be to cold for the dog at an a verage of 42 deg c so i picked the dark grey dog house because it was in the middle at 48 deg c the light grey house would be my next choise at an average of 45 deg c the light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3 deg c away from each other and i picked the dark grey because if it g ot colder the dog house would still stay warm enough for the dog
26721,10,1,black black would be a good because it is a dark co lor and dark colors absorbe heat so when the dog house is made it will be warm for the dog
26722,10,0,white white
26723,10,0,dark gray dark gray would be the best for the lids to m ake it sleeping light
26724,10,1,light gray light gray is not too cold but not too hot remember most dogs have alot of hair on their bodys to keep them warm amp so you dont want a dog house that gets too hot like the black dog house cause the sun obsorbs in darker colors if a dog gets too col d in the dog house provide blankets food amp water for a health y envoirment also if you see its a nice day outside let the dog play aroud dont make it get cooped up inside
26725,10,1,white if you painted the dog house white it would keep the dog cooler than if you were to paint the dog house black because the color black attracts heat more than the color white does so if you painted it black the dog would be really warm
26726,10,1,white i choose white because black and grays suck in alot of heat and white reflects it so white is less hot
26727,10,1,light gray you'd probably want a light gray so that in t he summer the house is cool and in the winter its warm
26728,10,0,dark gray it wwould make the dog house a good temperatu re
26729,10,1,light gray light gray doesnt wont make the dog house to o hot or too cold the dog house would be both warm and cool down
26730,10,0,dark gray dark gray is best because the temperature sta ys the same
26731,10,2,white white has the least temperature on the data t able and it is the lightest color like their hypothesis said darke r colors absorb more heat than lighter colors so white is the ligh test color there is so that means that the white doghouse wont absorb an y heat like the black dark gray and light gray doghouses
26732,10,1,dark gray i would say dark gray because if it was cold it would keep the doghouse warm and if it was hot the doghouse wold be wa rm inside
26733,10,1,dark gray cause darker the color more it atracts heat
26734,10,2,light gray brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse li ght grey because light grey absorbs more heat than white but it absorbs less heat than black and dark grey light gray would be perfect because during the summer the light gray would absorb some heat but not alot s o the doghouse would'nt be too warm during the winter the light gray wo uld absorb some heat so that the doghouse wont be too cold during the win ter i know this because in the experiment that brandi and jerry did whe re they found out how the color of an object affects its temperature the y found that the average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid after 10 minutes was 53 deg c the average temperature of the glass jar with the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48 deg c the average temper ature of the glass jar with the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45 deg c finnaly the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid after 1 0 minutes was 42 deg c this shows that light gray absorbs some heat bu t not alot so light gray would be the perfect color for a doghouse
26735,10,1,white if the color white is used on the dog house it would reflect the suns light causing the inside of the dog house to be cooler than if it was painted with a darker colored paint
26736,10,1,white white would best fit the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm
26737,10,2,dark gray the dark gray would be better for the dog hou se because its not to hot but not to cold the black would be to ho t becuse the average was 53 deg c but the light gray and white are to cold with the light gray's average at 45 deg c and white at 42 deg c so in this case the dark gray is the right color fot the dog house with the average of 48 deg c
26738,10,0,black how hot it will get
26739,10,0,white i go with white because then the dog wont be as hot or cold in somedays because most of the trials were different
26740,10,0,white they should paint the dog house white if the dog house was whiteand it was a sunny day then the dog would be hot do gs cant sweat
26741,10,2,black black will be a good color for the dog house because it attracts heat and it will kep the dog warm in its dog house t he average temperature for the color black is 53 degrees and the average temperature for the lightest color white is 42 degrees though black is better because it is a warmer color and the dog should rather be warm ra ther than cold
26742,10,1,dark gray it will not make it too hot for the dog or to cold for the dog
26743,10,1,white the darker the coler the hotter the air in th e dog house
26744,10,1,white white would be a good color for the dog house because it doesn't absorb as much heat as black this would make it cool er so the dog wouldn't be too hot
26745,10,2,black if it is cold outside and there is still some sun the color would absorb the sun making the dog house a little warme r for the dog to stay in giving a dog a wamer atmosphere would be better to have it cold and freezing brandi and jerry did an experiment wh ere they tested colors black dark gray light gray amp white and bla ck had an average of 53 degrees c while comparing to the white which was 42 degrees c that is 12 degrees apart from the black
26746,10,1,dark gray it would keep the doghouse warm but not to wa rm because dark gray is a dark color
26747,10,1,white i think that white would effect the dog house because it had the lowest numbers in the data table
26748,10,0,light gray the light gray color will keep the room bothe cool and warm at the same time
26749,10,2,light gray black absorbs more heat therefore it will be too warm in the dog house white on the other hand absorbs less heat as you can see on the data table during trial 1 white was 42 deg while black was 54 deg so if the roof is white the dog will too cool therefore th e dog house should be light grey it is a happy medium on cool days it w ill still be warm because grey absorbs more heat than white and on hot d ays it wont be too hot because grey absorbs less heat then black
26750,10,2,white the daog have fur and when it hot the white w ill reflect the heat from going inside and keep the dog cool in the exper iment the white got cool then the others
26751,10,1,dark gray if brandi and jerry paint the doghouse dark gray then when the dog would be inside the doghouse it would not be hot but it would not be cold either from the investigation for the air temperature the average of all the averages combined is 47 the closest color to that temperature is dark grey therefore the color dark grey is just the right temperature because it's not too not and not too cold the dog inside the doghouse would be perfect in this temperature
26752,10,2,black if the paint on the doghouse is black then the inside of the doghouse will be warmer the air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse
26753,10,0,dark gray dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house because in all the trials the dark gray lid changed the air temperature in the jar to 48 deg c the light gray lid change the air in the jar to 44 deg c in the first trial 45 deg c in the second trial and 46 deg c in the third trial dark gray would kepp the doghouse the s ame temperature where as the light grays temperature would vary
26754,10,1,white if you have a white houes les heat will be at racted to the houes because it is a lighter color but to a dlack houes mo re heat will be atracted
26755,10,1,black it will make the air inside the dog house war mer if the color is darker
26756,10,1,light gray the color might affect the dog house becuase dark colors attrack sunlight so black would be hotteer then dark gray wo uld be hotter then light gray and light gray would be hotter then white white would have the coldest tempature in the dog house and black would be the hottest
26757,10,1,white white would be the best choice for the dog ho use because dark colors like black and dark gray absorb a lot of energy a nd it will be hotter so therefor make a white doghouse and the dog would be in cooler temp
26758,10,1,light gray well darker colors absorb more heat making the dog house a lighter color will keep it cool but also warm but not to warm
26759,10,2,white white because the jar with the white jar lid stayed the coolest and only got up to about 42 deg c so the dog house would stay cooler if you painted it white
26760,10,1,black black will affect the dog house becouse black attracts the sun wich makes lots of heat and high temperature
26761,10,0,black becasue darker colors absorve more enrg y
26762,10,1,black black because dark colors absorb more energy
26763,10,1,white because thee adrker the color of something th e more heat is attracted to it
26764,10,1,light gray its the median tempurature from the experimen t so the doghouse temurature would be able to stay warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather
26765,10,1,light gray the color will keep the dog warmer in the win ter but won't make the dog house hot in the summer
26766,10,1,dark gray using the dark gray paint would be best becau se it was closest to the average temperature of all of the colors the do ghouse temperature would be warm which is good for the winter and most s easons
26767,10,2,black black paint well keep the doghouse warmer because the black lid was avaraged 54 deg c ware as white paint was only 42 deg c so there would be an avarge of about 12 deg c diffence b etween the white and black paint
26768,10,2,black the darker the color the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
26769,10,0,dark gray this color will effect the tempeture of the d og house because the tempeture doesnt change most of the time the dark g ray color keeps the tempeture the same and it keeps it nice and cool for the dog
26770,10,0,light gray black is too dark and it will make the dog de peress and the white is too light it will be dirty so soon so gray color will not make it dirty soon and depress it will make the dog hyper and m ore excited
26771,10,1,dark gray because it gives the inside of the doghouse a warm felling inside that would confret the dog
26772,10,2,white the color white would be the best choice when painting a doghouse because it would keep the dogs cooler on when inside than any of the other color choices the average temperature when testing white paint in the experiment was 42 deg c which is 11 deg c cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which has an average of 53 deg c proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best choice
26773,10,0,black it will make it absorb more enerrgy
26774,10,2,dark gray the color dark gray because it would keep the dog house cool for the dog because the average temp was 48 deg
26775,10,2,white the white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is hot outside since the temperature was lowest when the white lid wa s on the jar the temperature in the doghouse will be cooler with a white doghouse
26776,10,2,white because it does'nt get as hot at black dark grey or light gray the avrage for the white lid is 42 deg c the avera ge for the black is 53 deg c the average for the dark grey is 48 deg c and the average for the light grey is 45 deg c so there for white is t he best color for the dog house because it doesnt get as hot as the other colors
26777,10,2,white the inside of the dog house will be cooler be cause white had the lowest tempature at 42 degrees celsius
26778,10,0,white well dogs like light color so they will use i t more often
26779,10,1,white white might be the best color for the doghous e because of its low heat intake with the dog having long hair it wouldn't be the best decision to have aa black doghlouse where it would a lways get hot so with a white doghouse the dog could be more comfortabl e in a less hot doghouse
26780,10,1,dark gray if brandi and jerry made a doghouse the best color to paint it would be dark gray dark gray would be best because it absorbs heat so the dog won't be cold if it goes inside but it isn't as dark as black so if the dog wants to be cooler it can use the doghouse
26781,10,0,dark gray the dog house would not be too hot in the sum mer if you did a dark gray also if you chose a light gray it could be co ld in the winter so there for dark gray would be the best color
26782,10,2,white the doghouse should be white because then the temperature inside the doghouse would not rise as much on a sunny day because accoring to experiment and the data table lid color vs air temperature the glass jar with the white lid was the least affecte d by light for example the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid after ten minutes was 42 deg c while the average temperature inside the glass jar with the black lid after ten minutes was 53 deg c
26783,10,1,white the color white may affect the dog house beca use during the summer it may reach high temperatures and the color white refflects the sun making the dog house less hot
26784,10,2,white the average air temperature of the jar with a white lid was 41 deg c with the paint color as white the air temperatu re in the doghouse won't get as hot with a black lid in the previous exp eriment the average air temperature was 53 deg c which is hotter than th e white lid by 12 deg c
26785,10,1,light gray so it won't get to hot or too cold
26786,10,0,white it woulod affect the temperature inside of it
26787,10,1,white because it is said to no contract heat or ab sorb
26788,10,0,white i chose white cause it is the lightest color out of all fur of them and the other ones will just attract heat and the sun
26789,10,1,light gray it would affect the dog house by keeping it cool a dog that is active and does a lot of running the dog would not want to got to a doghouse that is painted black because that would attract a lot of heat to the point where the dog would stay too hot to cool off
26790,10,1,black it would keep the dog house warm becaus e the color will atract the heat wich will keep the house warm
26791,10,1,white this color won't make the doghouse to hot to the highest temperature the temperature of the white doghouse will be just right on a dog especially after more than 10 minutes
26792,10,1,dark gray according to the experiment black would be t he best and most effecient color in the pretense that you would want it to be warm inside the doghouse that is but the case is during the summer it gets very warm and what happens if you paint the dog's house black well that col or magnifies the sun's heat and you would indirectly scorch your poor do g usually though the heat here is cold and not hot so the best color for the dog house would be dark gray because during the summer and heat your dog wouldn't be too h ot and during the colder times it will still keep the heat in well
26793,10,2,white if the color of the doghouse is white this w ill keep the house cool according to the experiment the black lid incre ased the air temperature by 29 deg c in 10 minutes while the white lid only increased it by 18 deg c
26794,10,1,dark gray the darker a color is the more heat energy it attracts so the dark grey would attract not much heat energy to where its to hot but it wont be to cold either
26795,10,1,dark gray i think dark gray would be the best color for the dog house because out of all the other colors this was the only one with the same temperature throughout the trials it wouldn't be too cold or too hot
26796,10,0,black the color may effect the dog house because it darker then any other other color
26797,10,1,white white will keep the dog house cold
26798,10,2,white white would be the best color for the doghouse because the lighter the color is the less light it will attract the reason black dark grey or light grey wouldn't work is in the table it shows for the averages black is 53 and that is just to high dark gray is 48 and that is also pretty warm light gray is 45 and that is a little cooler th an the dark gray but noy much and then it shows white and white is 42 and that was the coolest of all the colrs bucause is attracted less heat
26799,10,2,white by painting the doghouse white it would make the doghouse cooler inside than painting it black dark gray or light gray because in the data it shows that the average temperature of the air in the jar that had the white lid was 42 deg c and the average temprature for the air inside the jar that had the black lid was 53 deg c by painting the doghouse white there would be a difference in heat of 11 deg c t han painting the doghouse black therefore painting the doghouse white would be the best choice of color to paint the doghouse because it would keep it the coolist temperature
26800,10,2,white if the doghouse is white it will not become as hot as if it were painted black the jar with the black lid had an average of 53 deg c under the lamp however the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42 deg c
26801,10,2,black i think the black paint would work best becau se it absorbed the most heat out of the four colors the average temperat ure was 53 degrees which was five degrees higher than the dark gray eigh t degrees higher than the light gray and eleven degrees higher than the white paint
26802,10,1,dark gray dark grey because in the winter the dogf mig ht get cold soit would be warmish inside of the doghouse for the dog and in the summer the dog might not even go in its doghouse it will probably want to lay out in the sun but in the summer at night it is the perfect t empeture to sleep in the doghouse
26803,10,2,white the white paint would make the inside of the dog house cool and not hot becuse dark colors absorb more energy as said in the text and bright colors don't
26804,10,1,white the white would make it cooler inside so in t he summer it wouldn't be hot
26805,10,2,white you should use white because the dog probibly has enough fur to last through winer so you would want to keep as much h eat out as possible during the summer i say this because according to the test reasults the average air heat from black was 53 deg c the average for dark gray was 48 deg c the average for light gray was 45 deg c an d the average for white was 42 deg c so in conclution the white paint i s 11 deg c cooler than black paint
26806,10,1,white white has the least air temperature 42 and so there will be less air temperature affecting on the doghouse
26807,10,1,black black because the coloe might get lighter and then darker and then lighter and then darker it will affect the doghous e because the house may become warm inside by the heat the black is bring to it
26808,10,1,dark gray the dark gray will be a cooling and warming c olor for the doghouse in all 3 trials it only got up to be 48 deg c an d the black got up to 54 deg c
26809,10,1,white it affects the inside of the dog house becaus e if white is the color outside then on the inside it will be much cooler than black or d ark gray since darker colors aborb more heat
26810,10,1,light gray the color would affect the doghouse by not ge tting to hot in th summer and not getting to cold in the winter
26811,10,2,white the white whould not be hot so the dog can no t burn up the temperatre was 42 deg and the hight was the black at 53 deg the diffentcies would be 11 deg
26812,10,2,black that color wil affect the doghouse warming th e inside of the doghose because in the data the color black was ranging i n from 52 deg c 54 deg c and the lighter colors were in the 40 deg c
26813,10,0,light gray its best its not that dark and that light
26814,10,2,white it will keep the dog cooler in the summer in each test the white lid was proven to stay the coolest the data shows that white has the lowest temperatures at 42 for trial 1 43 for trial 2 41 for trial 3 and 42 for trial 4
26815,10,0,black it was hotter outside
26816,10,0,white the white is not dark and not light white is between that
26817,10,1,dark gray dark gary might affect the doghouse by keepin g it hot in the winter but not to hot in the summer
26818,10,1,black the black will absorb more enery
26819,10,1,light gray its a lighter color and then it wont be that hot
26820,10,2,black black would be the best choice in colder clim ates washington because it absorbs more heat the dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black inside the jars blacks av erage temperature is 53 deg c compared with white which's average tempe rature was 42 deg c that is a difference of 11 deg c
26821,10,2,black if you use the color black then the inside o f the doghouse will have an increase in temperature according to the exp eriment a black lid had an average temperature of 53 deg c while t he white lid had an average temperature of 42 deg c therefore i can conc lude that a darker color will cause an object to have a higher tempature which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse
26822,10,0,black black affects the doghouse because is gonna b e to dark and hes not gonnaq want to stay in ther
26823,10,1,white how the color white would effect the dog house is if they painted it white it would be cooler inside the dog house and if they painted it black it would be hotter they should paint the dog house white so the affect makes the dog house cooler
26824,10,2,black in the experiment the black lid made the air hotter so to make the doghouse hot they should use the black lid for the lamp
26825,10,1,black because in the winter the dog has a beter chance of staying warm
26826,10,1,white white will not affect the doghouse because th e sun will not go to the doghouse as black because black absoed more the energy so the godhouse will get hot as much as the coloer black
26827,10,0,white having a white painted roof will reflect heat in the summer so the dog will not overheat inside it
26828,10,2,white having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler this is because white is a color that doesn't absorb heat as well as other colors which will make the doghouse cooler and more comfertable for the dog in the expiriment the air temperature inside the jar was 11 deg c cooler than the jar that was black which proves that painting the doghouse white will make the doghouse cooler
26829,10,1,black the sun will absorb the color black and the t emperature will rise
26830,10,0,light gray this color would give the temperature a fresh breeze in the hot summer days amp the fall
26831,10,0,black the dog would not be ale to see his house in the dark
26832,10,2,white in this experiment it proves that out of all the colors tested white was the best white stayed cooled the whole time while others tempertures went up
26833,10,1,white i don't think the color on the outside would affect the inside of a doghouse if your using a thicker material like wood but to be safe i would still choose white so the house would be colder
26834,10,2,black black will affect the dog house by making it hotter because the average temperature inside the dog house was 53 deg c the white will will not make it as hot because it's average temperatur e was 42 deg c
26835,10,2,dark gray i think that they should paint the dog house black because it absorbs more sunlight and allow the house to be warmer the black had the highest temperture that was 54 degrees and the white on e had 41 degrees
26836,10,1,white white might make it colder in the winter tha n the spring black might it hot in the summer and winter the light gray as well
26837,10,1,white since white is such a light color it doesnt a bsorb so much energy and it's cooler than the other colors cooler condit ions are best for a dog in my opinion
26838,10,2,white the white paint will keep the dog warm but no t stifling hot the paint had the lowest temp of air in the lab as white doesn't attract heat like black does
26839,10,2,white white paint will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler than it would be if the doghouse was a different color in the experiment the white color had the lowest temperature after 10 minutes and was 42 deg c the light gray was 45 deg c the dark gray was 48 deg c and the black was 53 deg c since the white had the lowest temperature it would keep the doghouse coolest and therefore be the best to use
26840,10,1,light gray the light gray because than i wont get to hot in the doghouse when its sunny out side because it wont absorb to much e nergy but when its cold outside it will still be a little warm because i t absorbing energy so it would always be the perfect temperature for the dog
26841,10,0,white because the whit well not be as heated in the dog house unlike black because that welll heat the whole doghouse
26842,10,1,white brandi and jerry should use white because it absorbs less heat than the darker colors
26843,10,2,dark gray the color might affect the doghouse by making the inside temmperature warmer than the temperature outside by more than it would if you used white or light grey because in the experiment th e dark grey absorbed more heat getting an average of 48 degrees c compa red to light grey's 45 degrees and whites 42 black absorbs more energy at about 53 degrees c but the dog might cook if its sitting in the dog house during the summer
26844,10,1,white because if u have a lighter color then the temperture would be colder
26845,10,2,light gray i chose light grey because the inside of the dog house wouldn't be too hot for the dog or too cold according to the data the result of light grey had an average temperature of 45 deg c w hile the black paint would be too hot at an average of 8776 53 deg c and the white paint could maybe be too cold with an average temperature of 42 deg c
26846,10,0,light gray if darker colors absorb more heat then i'm g uessing that that means it absorbs cold temperatures too so to keep it a t an even balance i would say the color light gray is the best choice
26847,10,2,black painting the dog house black would make the a ir inside it warmer in brandi and jerry's experiment the average air te mperate of the can with a black lid was 53 deg c whereas the dark gray was only 48 deg c the light gray was only 45 deg c and the white lid was only 42 deg c therefore the black lid made the air the warmest so a doghouse painted black will have the warmest inner temperature
26848,10,2,white if the color of the doghouse is white then i t would be colder inside the dog house and when it is warm and sunny outs ide the dog in the doghouse will not get to hot the results from the exp eriment support my desicion because in the experiment with a white lid th e temperature inside the glass jar was 42 deg c and all the other temper ature averages were a higher temperature than 42 deg c
26849,10,1,dark gray in the experiment the dark gray lid made the air temperature inside the jar an average of 48 deg c if the doghous e was black the air temperature would be an average of 53 deg c if th e doghouse was white the average temperature would be 42 deg c if the doghouse was dark gray then the dog wouldn't be too hot or too cold
26850,10,1,black it would affect it by making the dog house more warm when the sun is out the reason i would use this color is because when its cold outside during the day the black will absorb more energy from the sun and make it warmer for the dog
26851,10,1,black in the daytime the dog house will be warmer
26852,10,0,white this color through off more heat than the res t of them
26853,10,1,white this color might affect the doghouse because the doghouse might stay cool for the dog and they wont burn up in the dar k colors
26854,10,1,light gray during the summer the doghouse will stay a l ot cooler than it would with it painted black but in the winter it woul d be better to have light gray so that the doghouse would be warmer
26855,10,1,white i would choose white because you don't want t he dog to get too warm
26856,10,1,black that color might affect the dog house because it will keep the dogs warm at night in case of the cold air for example if it was hot and i was wearing black i would be hot as well cause its a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat on me and in t he air
26857,10,0,light gray i dnt know
26858,10,1,light gray it will asorb some heat into the dog house s o that the dog could stay warm at most times
26859,10,2,white if the doghouse was painted white in the sum mer when it was very hot outside then the dog would be able to go into t he doghouse where it would be cool inside i know this because in the exp eriment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures the ligh ter the color the cooler it will be inside
26860,10,1,dark gray it will make the doghouse cold and look dark even during the day
26861,10,0,black bacause its black
26862,10,2,light gray i chose light gray because then the dog house won't be too cold or too warm with light gray light gray was in the mid dle of the data white would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot the average temperture for white was 42 deg c and the average temperture for black was 53 deg c light gray was the perfect ch oice because it's average temperture is 45 deg c
26863,10,1,white in the data table it shows the black lid held in more hot air then all the other lids black lid held in 54 deg c on trial 1 whi le the white lid held in 42 deg c in the first trail the black lids average was 53 deg c while th e white lids average was 42 deg c by comapreing the data it shows that the whit e lid holds in less air
26864,10,2,white the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because it attracts the less heat in the trials the tempatures we re 42 deg 43 deg 41 deg and 42 deg which makes it the lowest t empatures out of all the colors
26865,10,1,black it might effect it by using this color it can make the doghouse more warmer on summer days
26866,10,1,white well when it gets hot in the summer the dog w ill be cooler and white goes with everything
26867,10,0,white white would reflect heat so the dog would not get verry hot
26868,10,0,light gray they might not beabol to see the thing
26869,10,0,dark gray that would help even it out
26870,10,2,white white because you want your dog to be cool e nough and according to the lid color vs air tempature inside glass jar chart white is the coolest
26871,10,2,dark gray i think that the color dark grey will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not too warm inside than if it was a lighter or darker color i think that because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53 deg dark grey was the second warmest at 48 deg light grey was next at 45 deg and white was least warmest at 42 deg
26872,10,2,white i would paint the doghouse white because that color would keep the doghouse cool in the experiment the jar with the white lid was an average temperature of 42 deg c and the jar with the bl ack lid had an average temperature of 53 deg c
26873,10,2,white they should make the dog house with a white r oof because that will keep the inside of the dog house cool instead of e xtremely hot in their experiment the average for a white lid was 42 deg c as apposed to the black lid which had an average of 53 deg c it would be a lot smarter to keep the inside of the doghouse cool by using white paint so the dog has some where to cool off instead of using black paint so i t is very hot in the dog house and the dog will not want to be inside of the dog house at all
26874,10,1,black because when is sunny the inside the doghouse is going to be so hot
26875,10,1,dark gray i think dark gray is good because the t empeture is 48 deg and that's not hot so the dog is not going to be hot and 48 deg is not cold either it's cool so the dog wont be cold or hot it'll be just right but that's my opinion
26876,10,2,black if they were to paint the dog house black the n the dog would stay warm as in the experiment it shows that when they used the b lack lid the temperature went from 24 deg c to 53 deg c in 10 minutes and when they used the white lid the tempurature went from 24 deg c to 42 deg c in 10 minutes this showes that the darker the color the great er increase in the air temperature because the darker colors absorb more energy
26877,10,1,dark gray it would effect it because in the doghouse it wouldn't be too hot and it woul dn't be to cold
26878,10,1,white the color white would keep the dog house at a cooler temperature
26879,10,1,dark gray how this color might affect the dog house is that with black in the summer the dog house would get to hot inside and with white in the winter time it would get to cold inside i chose dark grey because it would not get to hot or to cold because of the weather
26880,10,1,black black would affect the doghouse because if it was to hot the dog wouldnt have know where to go but the doghouse the the dog house would be extremely hot
26881,10,1,dark gray dark gray because that color doesnt absorb to much sun to make it hot and it doesnt absorb not enough sun to make it t o cold it absorbs just the right amount of sun so that its not to hot and not to cold
26882,10,0,black blach dontueist nating
26883,10,2,light gray light gray should be the cooler because in th e summer it wont be so hot because in the data the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or to cold
26884,10,1,dark gray the color wont absorb to much heat therfore i t wont be to hot inside the darker the color the greater the heat
26885,10,1,white you would want to paint it white beacuse white does not absorb as much heat as daker colors would therefor keeping the dog cooler in the summer time
26886,10,2,white in the trails the white lid got the least ho t so the dog house does not get to hot they should paint it white
26887,10,0,black it would have more air in the doghouse allowi ng the dog to breath easier
26888,10,1,white reflect more heat to keep the inside cooler i n the sumer
26889,10,2,black black would change the temperature of the dog house by making it warmer beacause black absorbs heat to most with the black lid the temperture was 53 deg c with the white lid the temperature was 42 deg c there was 11 deg c difference
26890,10,2,white i would say white because in the experiment t he darker the color the hotter it got and with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot
26891,10,0,white because dog likes to touch things so they mit e do something and make the lamp fall
26892,10,0,white it would be the color that would attract the least amount of heat
26893,10,0,dark gray
26894,10,2,black the color black will affect the dog house in many ways for example it will be warm in there when its sunny out side the way that i know this is the temp of the black lid is 54 digres then 52 digres then back to 54 digres so the average temp is 53 digres but fo r white the average temp was 42 so as you can see this is how the color o f the doghouse affects the temp it will be warm in the doghouse
26895,10,1,light gray the color light gray would have to be the be st color to paint the doghouse they wouldnt want to use black because si nce black is a dark color itll absorb more energy amp make the air temp erature rise high so black wouldnt be a good color because they wouldnt want the dogs to get to hot that is why i chose light gray because i thi nk its just righ to paint the doghouse with light gray the dogs wouldnt be to hot or too cold they would be just right
26896,10,0,dark gray when it rains or gets cold the doghouse will be warm and if it hot our the dog can be in some shade
26897,10,1,white it would make it cooler cause the color isnt dark
26898,10,1,light gray it is not too hot or too cold
26899,10,1,dark gray it might affect the doghouse by adding heat but not too much heat and the temperature will stay the same throught th e day when the sun hits on it it would be a good coloring because you d ont want the dog to get too hot
26900,10,1,white the dog house would not get too hot in the su mmer because white doesn't attract as mutch heat from the sun
26901,10,2,black black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors in the experiment it shows that with a black lid on a glass jar the air temperature will be 53 deg c on average and with a white lid the air temperature would be 42 deg c on average this shows that the black lid made the air warmer by 11 deg c and therefore black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest
26902,10,2,white that color might help to keep the air tempera ture lower since lighter colors dont absorb as much energy as darker colo rs like black or gray this was proven in the experiment because the aver age air temperature for white 42 deg was lower than the average tempe rature for black and gray 45 deg 53 deg
26903,10,1,light gray i think the best paint color is light gray be cause that way the temperature inside the doghouse will be warmer than th e outside so it won't be too cold inside but it won't be too hot like a black roof might cause it to be
26904,10,1,black so it would keep it warmer in the winter and warm in the soummer so the dog wouldent freeze at night
26905,10,2,white a white doghouse would absorb less energy an d its temperature would be cooler in the experiment the jar with the li ght white lid had a lower temperature than the jar with the darkest bla ck lid a dog house painted white would therefore have a lower temperatur e and the dog could use it to stay out of the sun and cool in summer
26906,10,1,light gray that color will not effect the doghouse becau se the light gray will not be to cold or to hot the the doghouse and for the dog who is going to be there in the doghouse
26907,10,1,black the doghouse would be hotter because dark col ors like black abosorb heat
26908,10,2,black the color black would be the best color for the roof of a dog house because according to the results from the experiment the air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors
26909,10,2,black black would be good for a doghouse roof becau se in brandi and jerrys trials black heats up the warmest with black at a n average of 53 deg and the onther three colors only in the fortie deg range so therefore if you have a darker roof the doghousewill be warmer for t he dog
26910,10,1,white this color might affect the doghouse by keepi ng it cool inside for the dog when it gets to hot in the summer and wants to go somewere where its not so hot
26911,10,2,white the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because in the experiment the white lid didn't get as hot a s the black lid the black lid reached an average of 53 deg c but the w hite lid only reached 42 deg c also with a white piant on the dog house instead of being really hot the dog house will be very cool
26912,10,0,black if the dog house was black it would attract m ore light from the sun to the dog house which would keep the dog warmer w hen its outside
26913,10,2,white if they use the white paint for the dog house then on the inside of the dog house it wont be as hot as if it were pain ted black or the two shades of gray the shades of gray and the black pai nt caused the jar to at least get up to 45 deg c and at the most the jar got to 53 deg c so brandi and jerry would be best of using the white pa int for the dog house because in the experiment the jar only got to 42 deg c when they used the white lid
26914,10,1,dark gray if the dog house is dark gray then the house will absorb heat to keep the dog warm on cold nights but also not to muc h heat so that the dog stays cool on hot days because the darker the col or the more heat that is absorbed if the color is not completely black t hen not to much heat energy will be absorbed
26915,10,1,white white because dogs like to be cool like how they are always panting they do that so the cool down so if it was black then the dog would be way to hot
26916,10,1,dark gray by painting the doghouse dark gray it would affect the inside of the house because it would keep it warm while not ov er heating it however if placed in an already warm outside temperature the inside could in fact overheat so a dark gray doghouse would be pref erable in a cooler enviroment
26917,10,1,light gray the dog house would not be hot but it would not be too cold either
26918,10,1,dark gray you want the doghouse to be hot but not too hot so dark grey is right in the middle
26919,10,1,dark gray dark gray should keep the dog house a medium temprature that isn't too hot or to cold
26920,10,1,light gray light gray would keep the doghouse warm so th e dog wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature so that the dog wont be to hot
26921,10,1,black black absorbes more heat energy so the insid e of the dog house will stay warm if it has a light source the sun thi s is proven when they had a black lid on the jar and it gained 53 deg w ith the light source being the heat source
26922,10,1,white the colors affect the temperature of inside t he dog house because darker colors attract more heat than white i chose white because it has the lowest average temperature of 42 deg c the ave rage of black was 53 25 deg c dark gray 48 deg c light gray 45 deg c and white 42 deg c all of this data was from the experiment the diff erence is 11 25 deg c from lowest average to higest average
26923,10,1,white if you paint it white it will attract less he at from the sun and the dog will like it
26924,10,1,black the color will affect how warm or cold the do g house is because the white would be 42 deg and black would be 53 deg
26925,10,0,light gray light gray won't affect the dog house in any way
26926,10,0,white i choose white because if it gets hot in the summer than the dog can over heat because they only swet on there nose an d paws
26927,10,0,light gray light gray holds the same temprature of 48 deg every time
26928,10,0,white my dog like white
26929,10,2,light gray light gray will keep the inside of the dog house cool but not to cold and will keep it at a medium temperature for the dog the data shows tha the light gray jar's average temperature was 45 deg c while the black jar was 53 deg c and the white jar is 42 deg c so the gray i think is the most comfortable temperature for the dog
26930,10,2,white because it had lowest temp after 10 minutes w hich is 42 deg c
26931,10,2,white the color white is the color that got the low est air tempature on the lid color vs air tempature inside glass jar so it would keep the doghouse the coolest inside so the dog would be most co mfortable
26932,10,2,white the best paint color for the doghouse is white this is because the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat the dog wouldn't want a hot sweaty dog house after 10 minutes of heat from the lamp the inside air in the black colored jar had an average temperature of 53 deg c but the white colored jar had an average temperature of 42 deg c the white colored doghouse is the best color for coolness instead of hot moisty and sweaty
26933,10,1,dark gray this color would deflect heat but also keep t he inside warm
26934,10,1,light gray it well keep it from getting to hot
26935,10,1,white white is the color most likely perfered becau se the color white doesnt absorb the suns radiations so it doesnt heat up as hot as others would
26936,10,1,white painting the doghouse white will make the dog house absorb less heat and the inside will stay cooler then if it were p ainted a darker color
26937,10,2,black the color black might affect the doghouse by making it warmer than using a lighter color like white because black had an average temp of 53 degrees and the color white had an average temper ature of 42 degress making the temperature 11 degrees warmer
26938,10,2,white if the dog house was painted white it would not get as hot on the inside on warm days the average lowest temperature after 10 minutes a light was 42 deg with the white lid
26939,10,0,dark gray darker colors absorb more energy
26940,10,1,dark gray the dog house would be warm because dark gray is in the middle of the temperature ranges when exposed to light and hea t
26941,10,1,white it'll make the dog house a lot more cooler be cuase the lighter the color the less heat is attracted to it by the sun
26942,10,1,white in the summer when its reqqally hot the white color will attract less heat therefore leaving the doghouse cooler
26943,10,2,white i woul'd choose white because the tempeture is cooler the average coming in a 42 deg c and the other ones are hotter like light gray is 45 deg c and dark gray is 48 deg and black at 53 deg so i would have choose the coolest least hottest one so the dog would not get hot
26944,10,1,white using white as the color for the dog house ro of would be best beacuse the sun light isnt atracted to whight as it is b lack so the dog will stay cool and not hot inside his house
26945,10,2,white the color white will affect the doghouse in a good way the color white dosn't absorb as much heat as the other colors do when they did the experiment the color white only got to 42 deg c while the color black got to 53 deg c also white turned out to be the color that absorbed the least heat of only 42 deg c which means insid e the doghouse it will stay nice and cool because it does't absorb as mu ch heat as the other colors do
26946,10,1,light gray light gray because in the summer it will not ge ttoo hot and in the winter it will not get that cold
26947,10,0,white because the dog house won't get too warm and dogs have fur on them therefore they would not want there doghouse to get to warm
26948,10,2,white white because the white lid temputature only went up to 42 deg c the other lid colors got a higher temputature so i chose the one that had the least temputature
26949,10,1,dark gray it would make it cooler in the summer and war m in the winter
26950,10,1,black it could make it to warm for the dog it depends on the weather
26951,10,1,dark gray the dark gray would probably be best for the doghouse because it absorbs heat but it still leaves out heat so when it is hot out the doghouse won't absorb to much heat
26952,10,1,dark gray i think that dark gray would be the best colo r to have on a dog hose because the dark gray had a steady tepature on i t that wasnt to hot or to cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want to be cold at night and to hot during the day
26953,10,2,white white would be the best color choice because in the experament white was the coolest color of an average of 42 deg c
26954,10,2,white the lighter the color the cooler the dog hou se will be causeing it to be more comfertable the white lid was an averag e of 42 deg c 3 deg c coller than the other lids
26955,10,1,light gray the color of the doghouse would keep it the right temperature not to cold and not to warm
26956,10,1,white becuase from there experiment the white lid d idnt get that much heatlike the others
26957,10,1,white the color will affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse colder by painting the doghouse white the air temperature inside the doghouse will stay lower since white is a light color it will not absorb a lot of sun like the darker colors will
26958,10,2,black painting the doghouse black would cause the t emperature to increase the most in the experiment the average air temper ature in the glass with the black lid was 53 deg c the glass with the d ark gray lid was 48 deg c the glass with the light gray lid was 45 deg c and the glass with the white lid was 42 deg c this proves that if brandi an d jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm they should use black paint oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse
26959,10,1,black the black color would make the dog house warm er for the winter so that the dog will stay warm
26960,10,2,dark gray it is the second high est and it should keep the dog house worm with out geting to hot
26961,10,0,dark gray my opinion for light gray cause it seems like an avaerga tempeture out of the four collors so i thing that the dog won t get hot if the collor method works
26962,10,1,white because white doesn't attarct as much heat an d therefore the dog would be a lot cooler in a white dog house than a bla ck one for example
26963,10,1,white the color white will make it cooler in the do g house so the dog wont get hot with all the fur it has
26964,10,2,white white would be the smarter choice because it reflects heat verses absorbing it according to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside having black roofing tiles would be smart as well because during the day they would absorb heat and then at night when it cools down the doghouse is warm inside together these two colors would make a very comfortable house
26965,10,2,white i chose the color white for the doghouse thi s is because if the darker the color the greater increase in temperature then i would want to choose the lightest color so that the temperature of the inside of the doghouse would be cooler than the colors light gray dark gray and black this would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer the darker the color the greater increase in temperat ure is correct because the average temperature of the inside of the jar w ith the black lid was 53 deg c when the average temperature of the insi de of the jar with the white lid was 42 deg c the white lid jar was 11 deg cooler than the black lid jar
26966,10,1,black that color might affect the dog house because it will be really dark and the tempeture will be really high
26967,10,2,dark gray i chose this color for the doghouse because s ince the doghouse will be located outside you dont want the dog to be co ld at night all dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways the experiment with different colors of lids proved it did have an effect on the air te mperature inside the jar the darker the lid the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat which is why i chose dark gray for the doghouse so its not too warm for the dog but if the dog gets ho t it can always come ourside of the doghouse and sleep
26968,10,0,dark gray dark grey because the darker the color the hotter it gets and so if you use light gray its best because white is to cold black is to hot and light grey could be to cold also
26969,10,0,black it wont be as hot
26970,10,0,light gray it can effect the ray of the sun
26971,10,0,black i think it said the blacker the lid is the butter
26972,10,1,white you would probably want to choose white becua se that is the color that will keep it the coolest inside the dogouse wh en the sun is shinning it is usually warm outside and the dog will want to use it to cool off not to get even more hot
26973,10,2,white the color might affect the doghouse by keepin g it cool in the experiment white had the average of 42 deg c as for black had an average of 53 deg c therefore 42 white is less than 53 b lack so brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white
26974,10,1,white the doghouse will be cooler and more comftera ble for the dog if it is white
26975,10,0,black black absorbs all colrs and the data table sh ow that the average for black paint is 53 degrees
26976,10,2,white white was the lid color with the coolest temp erature after 10 minutes painting the dog house white will keep the insi de of the doghouse cooler because white will reflect more of the sun's he at than say black paint in other words the darker the color the more hea t it absorbs and transfers to the inside of the dog house we want to kee p the dog house as cool as possible so that the dog doesn't over heat
26977,10,1,white the color might effect the doghouse by making it the temperature lower
26978,10,2,dark gray i chose dark gray because it will keep warm i n side but also it will keep cool when needed so if its hot out side it will be warm but not to hot and if it's cold out side it wiill be cool bu t also warm as well i know this because with the dark gray average tempe rature was 48 deg c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53 deg c and the white average was 42 deg c
26979,10,2,white the color white would keep the dog house not as hot inside as the other colors becasue white had the lowest temperature in the experiment whit had the lowest temperature average which was 42 deg c light gray's average was 45 deg c dark gray's average was 48 deg c black's average was 53 deg c that shows us that white had the lowest temperature and will keep the dog house not as hot
26980,10,2,light gray brandi and jerry should paint the dog house l ight gray if the dog house is painted in light gray the temperature ins ide the dog house would not be too hot or too cold in the result shows t hat the air temperature with light gray lid is 45 deg c with white it's 42 deg c and with dark gray it's 48 deg c temperature with light gra y is warmer than white lid but it's not too hot like the dark gray ones
26981,10,2,white this color would be the best to pick to paint the dog house because white reflects the suns energy and dose not aborsob it like all the dark colors see if you look on the data table it shows that the avarge temerature for each color was black 53 dark gray 48 light gray 45 white 42 as shown on the avrages of the differnt color s it shows that white dosnt obersever that much of the suns engergy and t hats why i think white should be what they choose
26982,10,1,black it is warmer than other colors
26983,10,1,white white because blakc would absorb alot of the sun thermal energy witch would over heat and dehydrate the dog same with dark gray and light gray white would be the best choice because white reflects light as appose to absorbing it making the inner tempature co oler and more comfordable for the dog
26984,10,1,light gray i choose light gray because it is not to cold anfd not to hot just right if i choose a darker color it might get to ho t for the dog and if it is a really light color it will be to cold and wont ke3ep him warm
26985,10,2,white the color white is the best choice it will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture this is proven by the data gathered by the trials according to the data the average air temperature of a black lid on a jar was 53 deg c when the lid was changed the white the temperature droped to an average of 42 deg c this proves that white would be a better temperature control factor
26986,10,2,black black would effect the dog house because it's a darker color and darker colors absorb heat which would make the dog ho use warmer inside in the experiment when brandi and jerry put the black lid on ther jar the average temprature was53 deg c opposed to when they put thee white lid on the average temrature was only 42 deg in the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house
26987,10,1,light gray light gray will make the inside of the doghou se warm but not too hot so in the winter a dog won't be cold but in summ er it won't be too hot either 45 deg c is a good warm temperature and t he temperature inside the doghouse should remain that temperature unless the color is changed
26988,10,1,light gray it wont get as much heat as black because dar k colors absorb more heat then other colors
26989,10,1,light gray light gray will keep the temperture of the d og house not to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter if the d og house was white it would have a temerture average of 42 deg c and if the dog house was black it would have an average temerture of 53 deg c a nd the dark gray would be to warm as well at 48 deg c
26990,10,1,white painting the dog house white would be very sm art if you didn't want your pet to over heat on those dreadfuly hot summe r days based on brandi and jerry's experiment the color black gives off more 11 deg c opposed to the color white
26991,10,1,white that color white will effect the heat because the light the color the less heat it will atract and so then the white w ill give off less heat and the dog will stay cool
26992,10,2,black black paint would warm the inside of the dogh ouse more than the other colors in the experiment black heated up an av erage of 53 deg c while the other colors were never increased more than 48 deg c if it was cold outside that color would warm the doghouse mo re because of the low albedo and high absorbtion of energy
26993,10,0,light gray brandi and jerry should paint the dog house a dark gray because you dont want a lot of energy in you dog house it sho uld be calm and relaxing but you always want some energy the dark gray wi ll make he dog feel more relaxed because in the experiment it says that the darker colors absorb more energy than the lighter colors
26994,10,1,dark gray the dark gray color would absorbe more heat t han a white or light gray color keeping the dog warmer when the tempera ture is colder but when the temperature is warmer outside it wont absorb e as much heat as the black would keeping the dog cooler
26995,10,2,white this color would keep the dog house colder th an the other colors because from the recorded data black's average temperature was 53 degrees celcius when white's was only 42 degrees celc ius
26996,10,1,white white because it will make it a lot more cool temperature wise than if it were black because darker colors absorb a lo t more heat
26997,10,0,white will they would like the dog to stay warm in his dog house and white dosent allow that much air to come in
26998,10,1,white i would choose white because it attrackes les s heat to the dog house
26999,10,0,black it will effect it because the suns rays will heat it
27000,10,1,black it will make it very hot in the dog house
27001,10,1,dark gray i choose dark gray because its not as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white its a perfect temperature for the d og in my opinion it doesnt have to much heat but just right its a relax ing amount of heat
27002,10,1,white they should paint the dog house white because if they would of painted i tblack it would attract more heat into the ho use and white does not attract heat or the sun light
27003,10,1,white this might affect the inside of the dog house because darker colors absorb more energy from the sun white would bring a minimum amount of heat
27004,10,2,black if you paint the dog house black the dog hous e would be a little bit warmer in the winter the only bad part is that in the summer it will be a little hot inside the dog house i know this bec ause in the experement that brandi and jerry did it said that the jar wit h the black lid was the hotest
27005,10,0,dark gray dark gray would be a good color for a dog hou se because it will keep the dog house warm during the winter and during t he summer the dog will spend most of its time outside its house the results in th e experiment were 48 deg c solid so that is a good temprature for a dog house not too hot and not too cold
27006,10,2,black if they would like the dog to stay warmer th ey should chose black because on average the black lid had a higher temp urature than the white lid
27007,10,0,light gray i choose light gray because it would be a nic e temperature if the dog house was panted black the temperature would av erage 53 deg c if it was dark gray the temperature would average 48 deg c if the dog houyse was painted white then the temperature would average 42 deg c but a light gray color would make the average tempurature a nice comfertable 45 deg c
27008,10,0,light gray it well make it lighter so the dog can see mo re better
27009,10,2,dark gray i chose dark gray because this will result in the doghouse being warm but not really hot it really depends on where t he people live and on the season dark gray 48 deg c would be more su itable because it would be pretty hot during summer but not as hot as the black 53 deg c but it also would be warm during the winter so it's a compromise between the weather the temperature used for explanation w as the average
27010,10,2,light gray i think that light gray would be the best col or because it absorbs enough light to make the dog warm without getting it too hot black would make it too hot and white would make it too cold
27011,10,2,black if you painted the dog house black the insid e would be hot because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot the average for the temperature was 53 deg c for black the average for dark gray was 48 deg c and gray was 45 deg c also wh ite was 42 deg c according to this data black would make things hot
27012,10,2,white having this colour will effect the dog house because light colours reflect heat so if you paint the house white then there wont as much heat on the walls making the doghouse cooler this i s shown by the fact that in the jar experement black had the hottest dat a and white had the coolest
27013,10,1,light gray light gray because it will not be to hot or c old
27014,10,1,white if they used white the doghouse would be cold er inside then it would if the doghouse was black the reason why it woul d be colder is because white reflects more sunlight than the color black darker colors usally abosord more heat then lighter colors
27015,10,1,white the darker the color the greatest increase i n temperature because darker colors absorb more energy the white would keep the doghouse's roof cool on a very sunny day since the light color doesnt absorb energy as fast as the dark colors
27016,10,2,dark gray i chose dark gray because it would effect the dog house by not making the inside of it to hot or to cold the average of the four averages was 47 deg c so i chose the closest one to 47 deg c and dark gray was 48 deg c so thats why i chose dark gray
27017,10,0,black the balck kid brings in the hot air and holds it good conductor
27018,10,2,white white because in the data it say that white had the lowest tempature with a average of 42 deg c if the they painted it white it would keep the dog house at a cooler tempature during hot sunny days
27019,10,1,white white because black colors dark colors attra cked heat towards them so if you get light color white the te mparture would be cooler in there
27020,10,1,white the tempicher will still rise but less then t he other ones
27021,10,1,white this might affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse cool inside during the summer
27022,10,1,white white had the lowest average temperature so it would be more relaxing for the dog
27023,10,2,black black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse one way we know that is when we did the expiriment with the lid colors black ended up with an average tempature of 53 degrees celcius w hile white ended up with 42 degrees celcius this proves that black absor bs the most heat if we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse
27024,10,0,white white dosn't obsorb light how ever black dose
27025,10,1,dark gray dark gray will affect the doghouse by making it warm in the doghouse not to cold like white or light gray and not too hot like the black
27026,10,1,black the darker the color that more heat it absorbs from the sun which would make the dog house much warmer they said becau se darker colors absorb more energy
27027,10,1,black black might affect the inside of the dog hous e because it will get really hot in the inside cause the sun will produce more heat on the darker color than the lighter colors
27028,10,1,light gray it would make it to where then in the summer it wouldnt be tohot but in the winter it wouldnt be to cold
27029,10,1,white i would say that painting the dog house white would be the best option because white absorbs the leat amount of heat e nergy and since dog houses are already small they are already hot and you don't want the dog to get overheated plus dogs have lots of fur to keep them even warmer if there is a chilly day in the winter you can put a blanket inside to keep the dog warm but i would say that altogether whi te is the best choice
27030,10,1,light gray the color brandi amp jerry should choose sh ould be light grey because if it was too dark then the house would get t o hot but if it was too light it would be more cooler then the black b ut it would be very dirty
27031,10,1,white if they choose white then the increase in te mperature will be the lowest of all the colors
27032,10,0,dark gray the dark gray color would keep the dog house pretty cool during the summer but also wouldn't be too cold during the w inter because the temperature was the same the whole time
27033,10,0,black black because it atracts sun and makes the do g house have more heat
27034,10,1,white if they paint the dog house black or any dark color the dog house would be way to hot for the dog because the dark colors absorbe more heat then light colors
27035,10,1,dark gray dark gray would probly be the best color because its not black and its not white in the winter it can get really cold and white attracts less heat but in the summer it might be okay but black in the summer might be to much heat so to even things out i think dark gray is okay
27036,10,1,black because the paint changes color thr hot ter it gets
27037,10,0,white i say white because the dog house is already going to be simi warm inside without the paint and with the white paint the dog house is already like 40 deg so the sun shining on the dog hou se that would put the dog house at 80 deg inside during the day then a t night the dog house will be in the 60s somewhere
27038,10,2,black the black paint will make the dog house warme r for the dog because the black lid on the jar aborbed the most heat wit h the highest average temperature 53 deg c
27039,10,2,black i think black would be the best paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer when the sun is shining down on the doghouse the average temperature for the color black was 53 degrees while the white color was only 42 degrees therefore black is the better color to paint the doghouse
27040,10,1,light gray if the color was darker but not black it woul d keep the doghouse warmer but not making it to hot beacause like in the experiment it was warm but not hot
27041,10,1,light gray i chose light gray because the inside of the doghouse would be warm and the dogs fur would keep the dog warm in the wi nter
27042,10,2,white the white will affect the tempenture inside t he doghouse by making it cooler the white absorbs less heat so it keeps more out of the doghouse allowing the dog to be more comfturable
27043,10,0,dark gray ahaha why are all of these questions soo frea ken hard ahaha
27044,10,1,white it will help keep the dog hose cool becus white atraks the least amont of heat
27045,10,2,black the color mght affect the doghouse because brandi and jerry said that darker colors absorb more energy heat so a darker colors will make sure the dog is warm
27046,10,0,black the darker color absorbs more energy
27047,10,1,dark gray dark grey because its not too dark so that t he dog gets to hot in the summer time but its not like it reflects the he at in the winter so the dog and stay warm the average temp was 48 deg c so it was about the middle of the not to hot and not too cold
27048,10,2,dark gray i would use dark gray the darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer black had an average of 53 deg whereas whi te had only 42 deg however we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing and cannot overheat dark gray had an average of 48 deg thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature so i n conclusion i've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice
27049,10,2,white i chose white because white would keep the do ghouse the coolest temperature when they did the experiment the black w as the hottest 53 deg c the dark gray was in the middle 48 deg c the light gray was also in the middle 45 deg c and the white was the c oolest 42 deg c
27050,10,1,light gray light gray because its not to light and its n ot to dark
27051,10,2,white it was the coolest with the temp of 42 deg c it would be to hot to use black which was 53 deg c inside the jar
27052,10,1,white the color whit will keep the dog house coller becuase the color whit deflects light better making the dog house cooler
27053,10,1,light gray it would not make the doghouse too hot or too cold for the dog
27054,10,1,white the lid color white could make a difference b etween the black lid the tempurture could not be high so they must keep the temputure cool for the dog
27055,10,1,white its would make the temperature inside the dog house not as hot so the dog does not overheat
27056,10,1,white the color white might effect the dog house be cause it absorbs less sun light then black dark grey or light grey what this would do is make it so it would not be to hot in the dog house
27057,10,2,black i chose the black color becasue that if the d og likes it hot then this would be the right becasue when they see what c olor would be the hotes and the trials number are 54 deg 52 deg 53 deg deg c and the average temp is 53 deg c if the dog likes it hot in there
27058,10,2,white darker colors usually attract more light by attracting more light it usually makes things much warmer so if you ha ve the lightest color there is then it would attract less light and make the doghouse cooler according to the data using a black lid made the j ar about 53 degrees the dark gray made it about 48 degrees the light gr ay made it 45 degrees and the white was about 42 degrees as you can see the lightest color had the lowest temperature so by using the lightes t color it would attract less heat so they should use the white paint
27059,10,1,black a dark color like black will affect the insid e of the doghouse because the darker the color the greater the increase in air temperature because darker colors absorb more energy
27060,10,1,white i would choose white one reason why is because u wouldnt want your dog to be hot so no dark colors and in your experiment white came the color that didnt get as much heat as others did
27061,10,1,white the white color does not absorb as much energ y as black in the doghouse the temperature will be about 42 deg c when it is a sunny day
27062,10,1,dark gray first where ever you live if it's always war m i would paint it light colored but if the area you live in is always c old i would paint it a dark color my theory is your dog is going to sta y warm if the weather is always warm your dog will be warm during the da y or night when your dog house is a dark color the dark color is going t o attract the energy
27063,10,1,black if the weather where brandi and jerry live is cold if they painted the doghouse black it would absorb more heat than dark grey light grey and white
27064,10,1,light gray light grey would be good because it wouldnt g et hot in the sun and black would be bad becaus the sun would make it rea lly hot inside the dog house
27065,10,2,black if they paint the doghouse black their dog w ill always stay warm because the color black will give the most heat i know this because the average temperature in their experiment was 53 deg c and the others were in the low forty's
27066,10,1,white this color might make the interior of the hou se cooler
27067,10,1,white this color will be best because when its hot outside the doghouse will be cooler than if they painted it black or a d arker color
27068,10,1,black black is a dark color so it will absorb more heat and make the dog house a hot temperature
27069,10,0,black dfg
27070,10,1,dark gray i think he wshould use the dark gray color to paint his house because it will be kinda in the middle of the other tem petures if they paint it white in the winter it might be colder because it does't attrack to much heat if they pick black as the color it would be to hot in the summer because it attracks more heat light gray will ki nda be like if you paint it white so i think you should paint it dark gray so that in summer it atracks some heat and that in the winter it does too so it would be even out in both summer and winter
27071,10,1,white white wont effect the dog house because white dosnt absorb that much heat so the dog wont get so hot and not be able t o use the dog house
27072,10,1,dark gray if the dog house was painted black the dog w ould get too hot in the summer time becuase the color black absorbs more energy but if the dog house was painted white the dog would be easily c old in the winter time because the color whit absorbs less energy in con clusion painting the dog house dark gray will attract the right amount o f energy for the dog
27073,10,1,white because white reflects off the sun so it woul d keep the dog cooler instead of having a black roof that absorbs light a nd would keep the dog very hot
27074,10,2,black i believe that the dog house should be painte d black because it can keep the dog house warm during the winter the dat a shows that the inside of the glass jar was 53 deg c when the black lid was used using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in t he glass jar a disadvantage would be that in the summer the dog house wi ll be too hot but as for the winter the black is the correct choice
27075,10,2,white the lighter the color the lower the temperatu re the average temperature of the black lid after just 10 minutes was 53 deg the average temperature for the dark gray lid after 10 minutes wa s 48 deg the average temperature for the light gray lid after 10 minut es was 45 deg and the average temperature for the white lid after just 10 minutes was 42 deg therefore a light gray and white paint would be best to keep the doghouse cool because it heats up slower then the other colors but if you were to use black or dark gray it would keep the dog house warmer
27076,10,2,white the color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors then the dog house will get too hot a nd your dog will be hot aswell as the study shown the color black had a n average of heating up to 53 degrees celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did same as the color black dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color dark gray had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white also in the study the color light g ray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degr ees celcious hotter than the color white the best color that brandi and jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color white b ecause the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made t he avergae degrees in celcious for white was 42 degrees celcious and if t hey paint their dog house this color the dog house wouldnt get hot nor y our dog
27077,10,1,white this might affect th dog house by making it c ooler in there intead of really hot all the time
27078,10,2,black blacks paint color would cause the inside of the doghouse to be warmer than the rest of the colors this is because bl ack absorbs the most amount oi f colors over every other color to prove this in brandi and jerry's experiment black kept the temperature of the j ar warmer than all the rest it was 6 deg c warmer than gray 10 deg c warmer than light gray and 12 deg warmer than white this clearly show s that black would keep the doghouse warm
27079,10,1,dark gray during the winter brandi and jerry's dog will stay nice and warm but not to warm when summer comes
27080,10,0,white it could get dirty you could piant it over agia and you could draw on the walls
27081,10,1,black the dark paint color is better because the gr eater the increase in air temprature in the doghouse becouse darker colo r absorbs more energy
27082,10,2,white if brandi and jerry use the color white for t he dog house the dog will not over heat because the color white does not attract the heat as much as the darker colors so the dog house would be m uch cooler
27083,10,0,black cuz black is ugly just like robert patteson
27084,10,2,white white will keep the doghouse at a lower tempe rture because in the table it averaged 42 deg and black averged 53 25 deg so to have a cooler dog house paint it white
27085,10,2,white while using white for the dog house the dog h ouse would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows th at the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did that way t he dog would not be so hot in its house
27086,10,2,black black because in the eperiment black was the one that had the highest tempature so the darker the color was the higer the tepature was
27087,10,1,dark gray i would choose dark gray because it doesn't a ttract a ton of light which means the dog won't get to hot but also bec ause it does attract some light which allows it stay warm
27088,10,1,black the color black would affect the dog house by keeping it warmest because dark colors absorb light and turn it into heat
27089,10,1,white white is the best color for the doghouse because it absorbs less energy then black paint would and then the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog
27090,10,2,white having the doghouse painted white will affect the doghouse by making it absorb less heat causing the doghouse to be co ol inside during the summer because in the expirement the black lids ave rage temperature was 53 deg and the white lids average temperature was 42 deg that s a 11 deg difference so painting the doghouse white wo uld be the best decision of paint
27091,10,1,light gray light gray because it won't be too hot diring the summer also wont be to cold in the winter
27092,10,1,white it won't be so hot inside and it will stay co ol
27093,10,1,dark gray this will keep the dog warm but it wont get to hot or cold
27094,10,1,dark gray i picked dark gray because it stays the same temperature and in the data table it stayed the same temperature
27095,10,1,white because if the dog uses it in the summer it w ill be cooler then a black dog house
27096,10,0,white its all about all the colors ha thats sick i could tipe now so how u bin good me im good to ya peace
27097,10,0,black black would be a good color because dark colo rs absorb more energy and it would be more confortable
27098,10,0,dark gray i think it would be a good color for the dog house
27099,10,1,white white will effect the dog house first this wi ll effect it because white will make it cooler in the summer because whit e doesnt absorb very much heat
27100,10,2,black black absorbs light just like with the jar l id when it was black it absorbed the most so if you colored the doghous e black it would increase the temperature inside it
27101,10,2,black they should paint the doghouse black because black will help keep the dog warm at night and during the winter when it gets cold when they used the black lid it made it warm at an average of 5 3 deg c copmared to when they used a white lid that only made it warm at an average of 42 deg c thats a difference of 11 deg c
27102,10,1,white because light colors are the coolest in the summer time so with white being the lightest one white would work best
27103,10,1,white it will make it be cooler in the dog house
27104,10,2,white the color white for the color of the doghouse would keep the doghouse nice and cool as shown in the table from the sc enario when the glass jar with the white lid had an average temperature o f 42 deg compared to the glass jar with the black lid's average tempera ture of 53 deg
27105,10,1,light gray light gray cause this will give the dog house some darkness but also bright so the dog will be able to stay cool and can sleep
27106,10,1,white i chose white becauseit was the color that ab sorbed less heat
27107,10,1,black if brandi and jerry painted the dog house black then the dog house would be warmer because the darker the color is the energy the dog house can absorb
27108,10,0,dark gray it might make the doghouse warmer during wint er months for example the average heat for the dark grey paint was 48 deg c
27109,10,2,black since black is the darkest color of all the o ther colors dark gray light gray and white because of the theory tha t darker colors absorbs more energy heat the inside of the doghouse wi ll be warmer as of the doghouse being painted the other colors the proof that black would be the best paint color for the doghouse is because bla ck is the darkest of all the other colors and darker colors absorbs more energy also if you look at the data table for the lid color vs a ir temperature inside glass jar experiment the average temperature for all 4 colors was black being the highest with 53 deg c dark gray b eing 48 deg c light gray being 45 deg c and white being 42 deg c th erefore black would be the best paint color for the doghouse
27110,10,0,white its obsorves less energy from the sun than al l the darker colors
27111,10,1,light gray the inside wont be too hot nor too cold
27112,10,0,white it will make the avreag tempecher go down by 11 degrees
27113,10,0,dark gray i think dark grey would be the best one becau se it stays at the same temperture every trial also it would be the bes t one because it affect the dog house as much as the others because it st ays at the same constant temperture of 48 deg c so that color on the dog house would be realiable
27114,10,0,black the black paint color would help make the dog house warmer during winter and insolate it better in the experiment the black lid had the best insolation because it started at 24 deg c and en ded at 53 deg c on average it was by far the best lid
27115,10,0,black the color my affect the dog house because the dog might not be the same color as the house or the house will be to dar k because its black
27116,10,1,black painting the dog house black darker colors a bsorb more light would attract more thermal energy making the dog house nice and warm for those rainy washington nights
27117,10,1,white white because it doesnt absorbe light it refl ects it so thier for the in side of the dog house is not going to hot bu t if you use black the in side of the dog house is going to be very hot b ecause black absorbs light
27118,10,1,dark gray it would keep it warm in the dog house
27119,10,0,white black and gray obsorb the color
27120,10,1,black if brandy and jerry pick paint their dog hous e black then the dogs will get very hot in the doghouse because black abs orbs the most energy as a result painting the dog house black with attr act the sun and make the dogs misserable
27121,10,2,light gray light gray would be best so that it keeps the inside warm but not too hot in the lamp expirement it was the 2nd coolest color
27122,10,0,black the color will affeect the doghouse because i t will be less hot iin the dog house and black reflects sunlight
27123,10,2,white this color will make the air in the doghouse less hot so the dog will be a lot cooler while in the doghouse i know t his because in the experiment the air is hottest with a black lid and coo lest with a white one so if the sun is beating down on the doghouse it will only reach about 42 deg c instead of 45 deg c or higher
27124,10,1,white color will affect the doghouse because if the house is painted black it will get very hot inside but if it is white it will say cool allowing for the dog to be comftrable in side
27125,10,2,white the shade white will make the dog house coole r inside because the shade white does not absorb as much light energy as the shade black i know this because in brandi and jerry's experiment t he air temperature inside the jar with the black lid was an average of 53 deg c and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 deg c but i'd like to point out that black and white aren't colors they're shades get it rig ht
27126,10,1,white the color white would best suit the doghouse because the color white does not attract very much heat energy so that wa y the inside of the doghouse will not be over heated
27127,10,0,white white affects the dog house temperature becau se it has less heat obsorbing in it
27128,10,1,dark gray the dark gray with make the house be warm not to coldnor to hot the data shows that the dark gray is always 48 deg c so you dont have to worry about the temperature getting clder ar hotter
27129,10,0,white if you paint the entire doghouse white then i t will appear to be lighter inside
27130,10,1,white it will make it for inside of the dog house it wont ne so hot because this is the color that reflects light
27131,10,1,white white will cool down the dog house because it is a lighter color
27132,10,2,white it will affect it by making it cooler than wh at the black would be if it were to be directly hit by the sun the black lid had an average of 53 deg c and the white lid had an average of 42 deg c therefore the white lid will keed their dog cooler in the sun
27133,10,2,white i believe that if bbrandi and jerry pai n the dog house white it would stay the coldest for the dog evidence shows that the darker t he color the more hot it gets for exsample the average temperature for b lack is 53 deg the average temperature for dark gray is 48 deg the average tempertaure for light gray is 45 deg the white color of lid was the lightest of them all and had the smallest temperature 42 deg i sugest painting the dog house white
27134,10,2,white the color white would affect the dog house in many good ways one way is it wouldn't be so hot in the dog house and th e dog would enjoy being in it the data table shows the temperature throu gh a three way trial the average temperature is 42 deg c which is alot cooler and fresh then the color temperatures
27135,10,0,dark gray it will stay the same even after it drys
27136,10,1,black it will make the inside of the doghouse warme r for the dog because dark colors obsorb more heat then light color s as shown in the investigation
27137,10,1,white it would be best to paint the dog house white because it won't make the dog house as hot when the sun comes out white won't attract as much heat inside the dog house as we discovered in the experiment white had the lowest temperature because it is a lighter col or as the colors got darker the temperature got hotter
27138,10,1,white the lightest color attracts less heat
27139,10,1,light gray it would keep the doghouse cool but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be cold all the time
27140,10,0,white i think that the white will affect the dog ho use because the sun will shine in and melt it
27141,10,2,black i would chooose black for my dog's house brco use during the winters the dog house would need all the heat it could get so i would choose black black is the best color to choose becouse in th e test it was an average of 11 deg c hotter
27142,10,0,white white dosent absorb much energy compared to b lack black absorbs the energy like crazy
27143,10,1,light gray light gray because it wouldnt make it to hot in the dog house so ur dog could sleep comfurabley
27144,10,2,black i chose the paint color black because this co lor would cause the doghouse to be warm all the time even on a cloudy or rainy day brandi and jerry's doghouse would be warm inside because the black paint would absorb the sunlight that was still radiating from the s un after 10 minutes of heating the glass jar with the black lid the air 's average temperature raised 29 deg c from the starting temperature of 24 deg c to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 5 3 deg c the glass jar with the white lid's average air temperature rai sed only 18 deg c from the starting temperature of 24 deg c to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 42 deg c the differ ence between the two average temperatures for the glass jar with the blac k lid and the glass jar with the white lid was 10 deg c this means tha t the darker the color on an object the more heat energy the color absor bs causing the air temperature within the object to be highest compared to any color lighter than it therefore brandi and jerry should paint th eir doghouse black due to the high amount of thermal energy that the colo r absorbs
27145,10,1,black because the temperature will be high and not low painting it black is the highest temperature
27146,10,1,white i choise white because white would keep the d oghouse cool in the summer
27147,10,2,white the white had the lowest temp in the jar so if you paint the doghouse white then it wouldnt be as warm
27148,10,1,white white duns not atat so mush heat
27149,10,2,white white would make the doghouse the least temperature the data showed that the temperature was on average 42 deg c the doghouse would be a cool enviroment instead of too hot the doghouse would be a place for the dog to go when he is too hot
27150,10,1,white white will make the dog house cooler so its m ore comferable in hot weather
27151,10,0,light gray it will affect it because it will absorb less heat
27152,10,1,white barndi and jerry should choose to paint their doghouse white because it collects less energy from the sun causing it to be a cooler temperature which is more resonable
27153,10,1,white white will not absorb so much heat than the o thers
27154,10,1,light gray the color light grey is best for the dog hous e because it does not attract a lot of heat so the dog will not over heat but it wil not freeze
27155,10,1,white the color white absorbs the least amount of e nergy so by coloring the doghouse white it will ensure the dog house is a more comfortable temperature for the dog
27156,10,1,dark gray dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use so that the dog doesn't overheat or get too cold the house would sta y cool in the summer and warm in the winter dark gray had an average tem perature of 48 deg c while black had an average temperature of 53 deg c and white had an average temperature of 42 deg c
27157,10,2,black if you choose a black color for your dog hous e the tempature would be warmer than if you used a white color because t he air inside the jar with the black lid was warmer than the lighter colo rs
27158,10,1,light gray it will keep the dog cool in the summer and w arm in the winter
27159,10,2,white the lighter the color the less air temperature the white lid color has an average of 42 deg c the black lid color has an average of 53 deg c the white lid color has 11 deg c less heat energy than the black lid color therefore if brandi and jerry are designing a doghouse for the summer then they should use the color white since it' ll be cooler vise versa if they are going to build a house made for a colder weather then they should use black since it absorbs more heat than any other color the darker the color the more heat
27160,10,2,black this color black may effect the inside of t he doghouse by making the inside of the doghouse warmer i say this becau se in the experiment with the lid colors the black lid made the inside of the jar warmer than all of the other jars so i'd pick the color black if you live in a cold climate because the black color will absorb the th e light and make the dog warmer
27161,10,1,white white because white has the least heat drawn to it then all the other colors so your dog would be way cooler and in be tter shape in a white dog house then any others
27162,10,1,dark gray dark gray should work just fine beacause its a little warm but not to hot and dogs like it a little warm so it would b e perfect for your dog
27163,10,1,white the color will keep the doghouse more cold in the summer
27164,10,2,white it wont be as hot as the other paints would l et heat in it shows that white was cooler than the others in there experi ment of lid colors heating up under a lamp
27165,10,1,light gray the color of the dohouse should be light gray because if the dog house is black its going be very hot inside the dog h ouse in the summer and light gray would be an ok temperature an ave rage of 45 deg c for the summer and da winter and every other seson
27166,10,1,white white would make the doghouse less hot on a s unny day making it a place where the dog can cool down
27167,10,2,white if brandi and jerry paint the doghouse white than the inside of the doghouse will stay cooler than if they painted it black or gray the average temperature for white was 42 deg c while t he average temperature for black was 53 deg c the difference of the tw o was 11 deg c so this proves that white would be the best color to ch oose
27168,10,2,white it will keep the doghouse the coolest avearg e for white was 42 deg c which would keep the dog from overheating
27169,10,2,white if the color is white it will be more cooler than a black dog house because black dog houses get hoter and faster th an white dog house if it was white it would stay around 40 deg instead of 44 deg 48 deg and 55 deg
27170,10,0,white the color of the doghouse is white becuase it brings out the color of the dog if its black brown
27171,10,0,white that will affect the doghouse becuase that wa y there wont be to much pressure in the dog house then the dog wil l be comfortable
27172,10,1,white it would make it cooler on the inside
27173,10,2,white if the doghouse is painted white then it will keep the inside of the doghouse colder in the experiment black paint ma de the air temperature inside the jar have an average of 53 deg c and the white paint had an average air temperature inside the jar o f 42 deg c
27174,10,1,dark gray i would go with dark gray so that way it doe sn't attract lots of heat but just enough heat so that way it stays warm inside but not really warm
27175,10,1,black i chose black because the dog might want to stay outside anyway during the summer and lay in the shade or run through water sprinklers and in the winter the doghouse would stay warm enough for the dog to sleep comfortably inside the energy from the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the doghouse
27176,10,1,dark gray i choose bark gray becase it the best colore for a dog house becase its not to hot and not to cold for the dog and th e average is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and if you choosed w hit it be to cold
27177,10,1,black the black lid will attract more heat to the d og house
27178,10,1,white because that color stayed the coolest on the jar
27179,10,2,dark gray the color will keep the dog house warm but not to warm the reason i know this is because in the expi rament hot lamp the dark gray lid allowed the temperature to rise an average of 48 degrees which was warmer than the 45 and 42 degree average of the li ght gray and white but cooler than the average of the black lid whi ch was 53 deg c
27180,10,1,dark gray the dark grey will make it so it isnt to hott in the dogg house or 2 cold in the dogg house
27181,10,2,white the lighter the color the cooler the dog wil l be when the lid color was at it's darkest black the average temperat ure was 53 degrees celcius when the lid color was at it's lightest whit e the average temperature was 42 degrees celcius if brandi and jerry wa nt to keep their dog cool they should use white paint
27182,10,1,white cause for each trail and avrage it is the lo west tepature
27183,10,1,black i chose black because it was the color that kept the jar the hottest degree c deg
27184,10,0,white tha color will atract so much heat
27185,10,2,black the darker a color is the more heat it takes in with the dog house painted black it will absorb more heat rather than if it was painted white which reflects heat in the experiment when the glass jar had the black lid the tempurature was 11 deg higher than when the jar had the white lid this proves that darker colors absorb more he at and that brighter colors reflecxt more heat
27186,10,1,light gray the color light gray will be the best choice because on average the air tempurature stayed at an average of 45 deg c so from the data you can tell that the color trys to accumilate to the weather also it won't be too hot or too cold for the dog to stay in
27187,10,1,light gray the color will make sure the inside doesn't g et too hot or too cold
27188,10,1,white if the dog house is white then it will be coo ler in the dog house for the dog
27189,10,0,black i will keep the dog warmer at night and durin g winter when its cold
27190,10,1,white it should be white so that on sunny days the dog will have a slightly colder dog house than if it was a darker color
27191,10,0,dark gray dark gray will effect the doghouse tempature because the air in the doghouse will stay the same all the time
27192,10,1,black it would keep the dog house warm because darker colors absorb more energy
27193,10,0,dark gray beause he well feel bad and dont like it and he wont sleep
27194,10,1,dark gray this color is not to cold or to hot it is ar ound normal temperature after 10 minutes it should be around the same te mperature and if the growth in temperature continued it could get warm on cool days
27195,10,1,black the color black will affect the inside of the dog house by the out side where the sun hits will affect the in sid e by makeing it hot
27196,10,1,white keeps the doghouse cool and does not over hea t
27197,10,0,dark gray this color can affect the doghouse by keeping an even temperature year round so the dog house won't get to hot or too cold for the dog the dark gray lid kept the same temperature the entire test giving me a conclusion that the dark gray color gives an even temp erature
27198,10,2,white the paint color that would be best for the doghouse is white white is the best color to use because it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool during the day so that way the dog inside of the doghouse doesn't get overheated i know that white would keep the inside of the doghouse at the lowest temperature because of what the data table shows which is that the color white's average temperature from being under the lamp for ten minutes was 42 deg c which was the lowest average temperature while the color black's average temperature was 53 deg c which was the highest temperature which would cause the doghouse to get exteremely hot during the day and that would be bad for the dog so that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse
27199,10,2,dark gray i think that if you choose a color to dark then it might make the dog really hot so i would choose dark gray because it won't very hot or very cold dark gray has trials that are 48 deg c which is hot however it is not as hot as the color of black with the highest temperture of 54 deg and it's also not as cold as the color of white with the lowest temperture of 41 deg so dark gray would be a good color for a dog house
27200,10,2,white if they were to paint the doghouse then they would want to use white becuse that is the one with the less tempa ture average tempature was 42 deg c for white unlike the black were tha t is the hottest one there is average tempature was 53 deg c if they wa nt cool for the doghouse then use the white
27201,10,0,black black will affect the dog house becuse black fades when it's in the sun the color will change lighter
27202,10,0,white because the white will not atract that much h eat like the other colors
27203,10,2,white because white does not obsorb as much heat as black the dog house will be cooler the white lid reached an aver age teperature of 42 dagrees c as suppose to 53 for the black one
27204,10,2,white in the experiment the white lid kept the tem perature in the glass the coolest so if brandi and jerry paint the dogho use white itll keep the inside cool for the dog
27205,10,1,black the darker the paint the the greater the incr ease in air tempurature in the dog house because dark colors absorb more energy
27206,10,0,light gray different color affect the doghouse color aff ect the heat in the doghouse
27207,10,2,black the black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house in the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius for the lowest color white it was 42 degrees celcius this means that the black was 11 celcius warmer than the white and proves that the black colored doghouse would warm up t he house
27208,10,2,white the white color will keep the dog house cool and not hot i know this because from the data the white lid was the cold est and the darker the lid was the hotter the inside of the jar was
27209,10,1,white if the dog house is white it will be colder i n the dog house because if the house is to hot the dog will not want to b e in it
27210,10,2,white the white will absorbe less heat and the dog house will be cooler or less hot in the experiment black which was the d arkest had an average of 53degrees celcius and the white the lightest co lor had an average heat of 42 degrees celsius
27211,10,1,white the color white would reflect the suns rays a nd keep the dog house cool
27212,10,1,light gray light gray because the dog will probably want to be cool and not hot
27213,10,1,white assuming that brandi and jerry live in a warm climate a white doghouse would be the better choice this is because wh ite absorbs less heat so a white doghouse would stay cooler and keep the dog cooler
27214,10,1,black black would be the best color because black e ntends to absorb heat thermal energy so the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors wouldnt be as good because anything that is li ght as in the color white it will reflect heat thermal energy
27215,10,0,dark gray i picked dark grey because it will be consistantly 48 deg c i know because in the table for each trial it was 48 deg c
27216,10,2,light gray light gray would keep the inside of the dogho use from becoming to hot and it would still be a better color than white for cold nights this is true because the average temperature for the bl ack lid was 53 deg c the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48 deg c the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45 deg c and the average temperature for the white lid was 42 deg c
27217,10,2,white if you were to build a dog house you wouldn't want it to get to hot so i would choose white the average was 42 deg c since it was the coolest of the jars i think it would be best for the dog house
27218,10,2,white the color white in the experiment showed that it had the lowest air temperature this color would affect the inside of the doghouse by making it more cooler so that the dog wouldn't be so hot in the doghouse
27219,10,0,black the color can effect the dog house because if the dog house is a dark color and its hot out side there will be more en ergy
27220,10,1,white the average temperature shows that using whit e paint for the dog house will be the best choice for keeping the dog coo l
27221,10,1,white white would be the coolest doghouse paint color they could choose because it takes longer to get really hot unlike the other colors which got hot really fast
27222,10,1,dark gray the color will effect the dog house because i f it is black it will be hotter because it atracts more heat but if its w hite then it will atracts less heat
27223,10,2,white the white will keep the dog cooler in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter too the black the dog would over heat be cause the average is 53 deg c but the white is 42 deg c which is ok for the winter and the summer
27224,10,1,black make it hoter
27225,10,1,black cause black is the darkest color which will m ake absorb the most heat
27226,10,2,white white would be a good color because on sunny days when the house is being shined on the white will make it cooler rat her then black dark gray or light gray white will be cooler because in the hot lamp experiment they tested results for all the 4 colors above and the average temperatrure for white was 42 deg c light gray was 45 deg c dark gray was 48 deg c and black was 53 deg c that shows that white wa s the coldest color while being shined on by light therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse
27227,10,1,light gray light gray because when it is sunny out the d og wont be hot beause black and other dark colors attract the sun
27228,10,1,white white would keep the doghouse colder then any other colors and dogs hate when there hot and really cold so white is pe rfet
27229,10,2,black brandi and jerry should paint the dog house b lack if they want the dog to stay warm because black absorbed the most h eat at an average of 53 25
27230,10,0,light gray it would keep the dog house at a good temp the entire year round
27231,10,2,white the white color will decrease the temperature in the doghouse because the average tmeperature for color black was 53 d egrees and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees a nd thus the doghouse will be cooler
27232,10,1,black well black absorbs light soo black absorbs he at which would keep the dog warmer
27233,10,2,light gray light gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it a nuetral temperature so it doesnt get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter in the investigation light gray was the s3rd hottest so it was one of the middle colors so it would stay nuetral
27234,10,0,white because if you have a dog house and you paint it a white it will be a light grey inside the dog house and so from tha t the dog house will be a nice shade of white with a light coat of grey o n the inside of the doghouse and if the dog house is a square thier will be a perfect color on the d og house
27235,10,1,white white because the black attracts light so th en the dog house would heat up th edark gray is also like the black so t hat wont work either the last decision was light gray or white so i pick ed white because that color doesnt attract light
27236,10,1,light gray brandi and jerry should use light gray so it could keep the dog cool in the summer and warm in the winter
27237,10,2,white if the doghouse is painted white the air temp erature will be lower than light gray dark gray or black the white lid jar had an average temperature of 42 deg c the light gray lid had an a verage temperature of 45 deg c the dark gray lid had an average tempera ture of 48 deg c and the black lid had an average temperature of 53 deg c therefor white will help make the inside of the doghouse cooler
27238,10,2,white if the color is a dark color then the tempera ture will increase more than if the color is a lighter shade white was t he color that affected the temperature the least in the experiment and th at would be the best color for the doghouse's temperature
27239,10,1,white because white its absorbs less energy there f or cooler air tempeture
27240,10,0,dark gray it might affect the dog house a little i cho ose dark gray because it's average
27241,10,2,white it wil be the coolest one at 42 deg c and do gs have fur to keep them warm so you want a cool doghouse
27242,10,1,light gray the light gray is the best brcause it will ab sorb the heat from the sun but won't get to hot
27243,10,0,white this color will affect the doghouse because the color white will allow more air to be in the doghouse at once
27244,10,2,white i chose white because from the results of the experiment white had the lowest average temperature of 42 deg c which means that the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog if the sun is shining on it all day
27245,10,2,light gray this color might affect the dog house because in the summer when it's really hot the light grey will not get too hot and the house is cooler and not as stuffy for the dog to sleep in versus' the black it would be immensely humid and stuffy in there also the light grey is good for the dog's wellbeing because during the winter time the temperature will be really cold but it would be dark enough to keep warm so in conclusion light grey is the best because it keeps cool in the summer and it keeps warm in the winter some evidence is that in the experiment the average for the light grey was 45 deg c and the average for the black w as 53 deg c the light gray kept cool while the black did not so durin g the summer the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house if they had a light grey house they would have a nice cool house to lou nge in over the summer and it is a good way to keep warm during the winte r as well black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter
27246,10,1,black it will make the doghouse really warm inside because the darker the color the more it absorbs energy
27247,10,1,white white color will give back the sunlight it m ake the doghouse will not get too much hot
27248,10,1,white the color white is a combination of all of th e known colors and by being that combination absorbs less heat while proj ecting the combination color that it produces
27249,10,2,white the color white would be a good color for a d oghouse because it heats up the air in it the least in the experiment t he color white only heated up the air in the jar to an average of 42 deg c compared to the color black which heated up the air in the jar to an average of 53 deg c
27250,10,1,white it would reflect the most sunlight so the ins ide temprature would be cooler than if you were to use any of the other c olors
27251,10,1,white this color might affect the dog house because the lighter the color the cooler the dog house will be
27252,10,1,dark gray if they choose dark gray as the color for the doghouse the temperature of doghouse would be neither too hot or too co ld for the dog i chose dark gray because black would be too hot for dogs because they have furs but white would be too cold because even though t he dogs have furs if the temperature is cold thye will get cold so i t hink dark gray is the best color to choose
27253,10,0,white white would be the best color because it refl ects the light so it would not be to hot and not to cold in the dog house
27254,10,2,dark gray it will be warm inside the doghouse but not too warm the black lid made the air in the the jar very warm i t hought it might be too hot for the dog
27255,10,1,white the white was the coldest and most dogs have a lot of fur so therefor the white would be best
27256,10,1,dark gray it will not be to hot or to cold
27257,10,2,dark gray i chose dark gray because black is the darkes t color and from the previous experiment it showed that darker colors abs orb more heat as for white is would get the least amount of heat main r eason i chose dark gray was because from my expericence dogs tend to be c old so it will be warm but not too hot
27258,10,2,white white would be the best color for a dog house because it would not absorb as much energy as the other colors and there fore a white doghouse would not be as hot inside as black or gray one th e results from the expirement showed that the air in the jar with a black lid was 11 degrees c hotter than the jar with a white lid and the same would apply to a doghouse
27259,10,1,light gray well if you paint the dog house light gray i t will keep the dog warm at night but not to warm were its over heated
27260,10,1,black becouse black color gets worm fastere then other colors and gets hit black get the tempeture 54 the other colors get less then that
27261,10,1,white if they use the white color than the dog hous e would be cooler because brighter colors reflect the sun and in the end it would bw cooler for the dog which would make the dog happier also the white color would look good
27262,10,2,black brandi and jerry should paint their doghouse black he will be warm inside the black doghouse because the average tempature of the black lid was 53 deg c in the jar with the white lid the average tempature was 42 deg c it will be 11 deg c warmer in the black doghouse than the white one that is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight
27263,10,1,white this color will make the inside of the dog ho use cooler according to the data given by brandi and jerry's expirement
27264,10,2,dark gray brandi and jerry should paint their dog house dark gray because dark gray doesn't ge to hot and isn't to cold in the summer than the dog house will not get to warm yet it will not get to col d in the winter because it does attract some sunlight to keep it at an av erage of 48 deg c that way their dog can always enjoy it's dog house no matter what the temperature is outside
27265,10,2,dark gray the darker the color the warmer it is inside and if it was black it would be to hot and white or light gray would get to cold
27266,10,1,black make the doghouse warmer
27267,10,2,white white would be best because it reflects more energy the table shows that the average temp after three trials for the white lid was 42 degrees celcius which is 11 dgrees cooler than the h ighest average 52 degrees celcius or the black lid
27268,10,0,black the darker color obsorbs more heat so it woul d bi a good dog house
27269,10,1,white it would make the dog house cooler because it wouldnt attract as much heat this is because the darker the color the more energy it absorbs
27270,10,2,white the white paint is the best because it wont get as hot as the other color's will beacuse the highest temp was 43 deg c and the lowest was 41 deg c so white is the best becaue it stays the coldest
27271,10,1,black it may affect the dog house by making it warm er than the dark grey light grey and white paint would because the colo r black attracts heat more than any other color
27272,10,0,light gray idk
27273,10,1,black the solor energy sun will be attracted to the black paint to make the inside temperature of the doghouse increase
27274,10,2,white if ypu wanted the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11 deg c cooler then the black dark grey or light grey
27275,10,2,light gray the color of the doghouse might affect the in side of the doghouse by the temperature inside as shown in the data tab le of the experiment the data shows that the average temperature is 45 deg c which when comapared to other temperatures it shows that it is not lowest or the highest its in the middle
27276,10,2,white i think that white would be the best color to paint the dog house because it is the color that reflects the most light so it would keep the dog nice and cool during the summer this experiment shows that the white lid had the lesser temperature inside of the jar so it is the best color
27277,10,1,dark gray dark gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse because it's not too hot and it's not too cold the average temperature would be 48 deg c just right
27278,10,1,white the dog house will be coller in the sun becau se the thermal heat will not get as hot as if it got painted black
27279,10,1,white the color white might affect the dog house be caus lighter colors reflect light
27280,10,1,light gray i would say light gray because if it was blac k and in the summer time it would be way to hot and if it was white in th e winter it could get to cold so i think light gray is the best because i t wouldn't be to hot in the summer or to cold in the winter
27281,10,2,black i pick black because black is a dark color an d and darker colors atract energy like heat so that way the inside of t he dog house will be worm like for the black lid all the results were 54 and all the other colors were 10 deg and less
27282,10,1,light gray the color will affect it by warming up inside the dog house but not makeing it to hot beacase 48 deg c is really hot so why not make it less like 45 deg c and 42 deg c and 53 deg c is to cold and too hot so make it warm wouldn't u want a warm place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were
27283,10,1,white it would keep the doghouse cooler
27284,10,2,white the color white absorbed the least heat out o f all the colors so the doghouse would not get overheated inside and stay cool just in case there was a hot summer day
27285,10,1,white i would pick white because with white it stay s cooler in the doghouse than if were black to be more hotter inside
27286,10,1,black the color will make the doghouse warmer decr easing the need for auxiliary equipment facilitating the increased conduc tion of heat energy from the contained atmosphere between the doghouse wa lls to the dog thus facilitating the dog's survival while maximizing cos t efficiency therefore the doghouse should be black quod erat demonstratum
27287,10,2,dark gray this color would keep the temperature just ri ght it wouldn't be too hot or to too cold the average deg c was 48 deg c the lowest average wsa 42 deg c and the highest average was 53 deg c
27288,10,1,white choosing white for the color of the doghouse will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because darker colors absorb more energy
27289,10,1,white the darker the paint the more heat inside the room so you want the lightest colored object
27290,10,1,black it will make it so that the dog will be warme r at winter
27291,10,2,light gray i pick light gray because after 3 trials of 24 deg c for 10 minutes it had an average of 45 which means that the temperature remained not to hot and not to cold
27292,10,0,light gray black because it would get to hot for the dog and white because it could also get to cold
27293,10,1,light gray i think light gray because from the data tha t was the color that was almost in the middle so that the dog house woul dn't get too heated in the summmer or spring and it wouldn't get too col d in the winter or fall
27294,10,0,do they want the dog house to be warmer or co oler if they want to have the dog house warm all year choose black paint if they want ithe dog house cooler all year then chose white paint if they want the dog house to be luke warm chose gray paint if they wanted it to be medeum cold chose light gray paint not enof info to tell what you are asking for
27295,10,1,white black could cause the inside of the doghouse to heat up quickly because the color black heats up faster then most othe r colors
27296,10,2,white white will keep the dog house cool on a hot s ummer day more than a darker color such as black white was on averge 11 deg c cooler than black
27297,10,1,black since dark colors capture more heat use black for color to help keep doghouse warm
27298,10,2,light gray the best paint color to paint a dog house bas ed on the results is light gray i said light gray because it was average 45 deg c it is not too hot and not too cold if you painted the dog ho use light gray it would keep the dog warm but not too warm the black lid was average 53 deg c it got hotter because the color was darker the d ark gray was average 48 deg c it was warm but not as warm as the black because the color was not as dark the light gray was average 45 deg c it got cooler because the lid color was lighter the white lid averaged 4 2 deg c because it was the lightest and dark colors absorb more heat
27299,10,2,white white might affect the doghouse because it will not absorb as much heat as any of the other colors do black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42
27300,10,1,black the color might affect by since it is black i t will absorb more light energy which then makes the temputure higher so the inside will be warmer hotter
27301,10,1,white the color white will keep the doghouse cool u nder sunlight because in the expirement the white color reflects sunlig ht not absorbing it so the doghouse will be cooler
27302,10,1,white if it is a lighter color then the doghouse wo n't get as hot as it would if you painted it a darker color
27303,10,2,white this color might effect the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature from all the colors in average 42 deg c also it will keep the doghouse cool in the summer so the dog doesnt get too warm in the summer
27304,10,1,light gray they should use light gray paint because the black would attract too much heat the darker paint would absorb more heat like the black lid the white paint would be too light and in the winter wouldn't attract as much heat as needed
27305,10,2,light gray the color light grey will not absorb too much heat in the summer to keep the dog cool but will retain some heat in the winter to keep the dog warm in the experiment the color light grey had a temperature that was 21 deg higher than the starting temperature of 24 deg but did not increase too much like the dark grey and black which rose 24 deg and 30 deg from the original temperature of 24 deg
27306,10,2,white white would be the best color because it had the lowest air temperature with 42 deg c this would keep the inside of the doghouse air temperature cooler on hot days than a darker color would
27307,10,1,light gray for the bog house not to be to cold or hot
27308,10,2,black black was the highest tempature when under th e lamp so if brandi and jerry wanted a warm doghouse they would choose bl ack because black had an avrage of 53 deg c insted of other averages lik e 48 deg c 45 deg c and 42 deg c
27309,10,1,white i think that if you use a white paint then th e dog house will be nice a cool because if you use black the dog would ge t hot so that why you shuld use white
27310,10,0,dark gray during the summer the dog houses temp would be 48 deg this would keep it cool during the winter the darker color will help keep the heat inside the dog house
27311,10,1,black black attracts more heat
27312,10,1,black the black paint will trap more heat inside i t will be hotter in the doghouse than if brandi and jerry used dark grey light grey or white
27313,10,2,dark gray the dark gray color is fine becuz its not to dark and its not too brigth dark gary had a 48 deg c avg and the darkes t is black which had a 53 deg c avg also the brightest which is wh ite had a 42 deg c avg
27314,10,1,black it would make the doghouse warm due to the da rk color
27315,10,1,black the black paint color will attract more sun for the dog to keep warm and be comfortable
27316,10,2,white white is the best color to paint the doghouse because based on the experiment dark colors absord heat and light colo rs don't the hottest air temperature in the jar experiment 53 deg c w as from the jar with the black lid and the jar with the coolest air temp erature 42 deg c was from the jar with the white lid proving that lig ht colors don't absorb heat and dark colors do
27317,10,2,white painting the doghouse white would ensure that the dog doesn't get too hot while it's inside white would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler than any other color i know this because in the experiment the average temperature for the white lidded jar was less than any other colored lid
27318,10,1,white the color might affect the doghouse by taking in less energy causing the inside of the doghouse to be cooler
27319,10,2,white by painting the dog house white it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler this is proven because in each trial white had the lowest temperature for example in the experiment white's average tempurate was 42 deg compared to black's average which was 53 deg a huge difference
27320,10,2,white i chose white because white reflects the suns energy so it would stay cooler in the doghouse the data that brandi and jerry got show that white kept the temperature about 11 deg c cooler th an the black lid
27321,10,1,black it will make it warmer for the dog inside bec ouse it absorbs more energy
27322,10,2,light gray i think that light gray will look nice on the outside of the dog house and it will keep the dog very nice and cool because on the data it shows that light gray was the second coolest colored lid
27323,10,2,white the color white will affect the inside of the doghouse because in the lid vs air temperature inside glass jar table it shows that the color white doesn't heat up as much as the other colors the color white reflects the light making it stay cool which is what y ou want for a doghouse
27324,10,1,black i think the color black will make the isnside of the dog house warm because it is a dark color
27325,10,2,white they might use white because it doesnt get ho t as fast as the other colors do in the data table it shows that the fir st trail was 42 deg c the second trial was 43 deg c the third was 41 deg c and the fourth was 42 deg c for all the other colors the trials got highe r than 43 deg c therefore the white would be best for a dog house bec ause it doesnt get as hot
27326,10,1,light gray it will make the dong house in between hot an d cold
27327,10,1,white white attracts less heat so the dog will no b e harmed on very hot days
27328,10,1,white to design the dogs house i think that the pai nters should you used white paint because sunlight absorbs into darker c olors because they cannot reflect the light so therefor the dark colors j ust continue to absorb all the light
27329,10,0,black it will make the inside of the dog house cold or warm
27330,10,2,white the color white would be the best to paint th e doghouse because it will be kept cooler than black which the average w as 53 degree celcius dark gray which the average was 48 degree celcius ligh gray which the average was 45 degrees celcius and the whites averag e was 42 degree celius black absorbs the most heat while white reflects
27331,10,2,white this color would make the dog house 11 deg c cooler than than if it was a black color so the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperature in the house in brandy and jerry's experiment the white lid was the coldest and they said dark colors absor b more heat so white would be an appropriate color
27332,10,1,light gray light gray might affect the doghouse by havin g the averge temperature of 45 deg c so if it is cold outside it wont fre eze the dog or if it's too hot outside it wont make the dog too hot black had the highest aveage of 53 deg c dark gray had the aveage of 48 deg c and white had the lowest average of 42 deg c the light gray is just the right temperature for the doghouse of 45 deg c
27333,10,2,light gray this color might bring the inside of the dogh ouse to a comfortable temperature according to the results of the experi ment the colors were in this order from the highest to lowest temperatu re black dark gray light gray white dogs do not normally enjoy hot stuffy enviornments they pant uncontrollably when they are overheated and get very uncomfortable this light gray color will allow the dog not to get uncomfortably overheated but will also not allow him her to reach an uncomfortably cool body temperature as white was resulted in the col dest temperature according to the experiment results
27334,10,0,white i think that white is a good color because he at will not be attracted as fast and white is a really nice color
27335,10,1,black this color would keep the doghouse warm during the nights and cold days and if it is a hot day then the dog will be outside anyways
27336,10,2,black black will keep the inside of the doghouse the warmest because it will absorb the most heat in the lab black had an average of 53 deg c and white had an average of 42 deg c
27337,10,1,black black is a darker color so there forth it att racts heat which would cause th tempatuer to go up
27338,10,1,dark gray well the dark gray would make it warmer but not to warm amp they temperature would stay at one degree so its would be 48 deg in there
27339,10,0,white it would reflect most heat because it absorb as much emergy as darker colors
27340,10,2,black black because the black had the highest numbe r the whole expirment and it stayed the warmest out of all of the other c olor
27341,10,2,white coloring the doghouse white will give an effe ct by not making it hot like other colors in the experiment they found out that the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42 deg the black lid was 53 deg the dark gray was 48 deg and lastly the light gray was 45 deg therefore we can conclude that the white attracts the leas t sunlight which will affect the temperature of the inside less
27342,10,1,light gray light gray because when the dog is sleeping i n the dog house and its ranning he will get cold because it is white so t hey for light gray will keep it warm and cool at the same time for those winter days and the cold days with ran
27343,10,1,black the sun will be attracted to black and it wil l make the dog house really hot
27344,10,0,white darker colors absorb heat from light so ligh ter colors reflect it
27345,10,0,light gray it will wear
27346,10,2,white white because it kept the inside of the jar t he coolest so the dog wouldn't get to hot in the summer the insidde of t he b jar with the black lid had an average of 53 deg c and the jar with the white lid only had an average of 42 deg c
27347,10,0,black the color might effect the inside because the color of the wood
27348,10,2,white the color white will ensure that the temperature inside the dog house will stay much cooler than the colors black dark gray and light gray because lighter colors don't absorb as much heat energy as darker colors do for example the inside of the jar with the black colored lid had an average temperature of 53 deg c while the inside tempeture of a jar with a white lid had an average temperature of only 42 deg c the inside of the jar with the white lid was 11 deg c less than the jar did with the black lid
27349,10,1,dark gray it will be warm in the doghouse for the winte r but not to hot for the dog in the summer
27350,10,0,black because it atracks energy and that makes the paint to come off
27351,10,1,light gray it wouldnt be to hot to live in for a dog but it would be warm and provide heat
27352,10,1,white white because white paint adsorbse heat less than the darker colors and you wouldn't want your dog to over heat
27353,10,1,light gray light gray will keep the dog house warm in th e winter because it is a dark color and it will also cool down the dog ho use because it is a light color aswel
27354,10,0,white it would keep the dog cool enough to withstan d the heat and have enough warmth for winter since dogs have fur on their bodies to keep warm
27355,10,2,black having a black doghouse might affect the insi de of a doghouse because it would keep it warmer inside because darker co lors such as black absorb heat better in brandi and jerry's experiment t he average temperature for the black lid jar was 53 deg c 5 deg c more than the next warmest one dark gray
27356,10,2,black if they paint the dog house black the conditi ons in the house would be hot because the jar was the hottest when they p ut the black lid on the jar so that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color
27357,10,2,dark gray the darker the color of the doghouse the hott er it will be so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the w inter you dont want it to be white so i picked dark gray becasue in the winter it will still attrack sunlight to keep it warm but in the summer i t wont attract as much as the black would
27358,10,1,its depends on were they live if its a hot pl ace then a white dog house but if its a cold place then a black dog house to make the doghouse a little warmer and in the middle if its a mixture
27359,10,1,white white would make the dog house cooler and mor e pleastent to live in
27360,10,2,dark gray i would choose dark gray because in the summe r it may become warm for the dog so black would be too hot in the winte r black would be the best because it is a color that attracts more energy so it would increase the temperature inside so for an all around the ye ar comfortable paint i would choose dark gray because its the median betw een them both
27361,10,0,white ir afeeect other people to what they may have dont to othewers and atht jksdjoiauy dhsaj 3 hfgyunashgygajshu
27362,10,2,light gray dark grey would affect the temperature in the dog house by making it so that the dog house was neither too hot or too cold the results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42 deg c in the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53 deg c however even though according to the experiment the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool the experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid but only by 3 deg c therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5 deg c cooler than the jar with the black lid the dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer but remain warm in the winter
27363,10,0,light gray it will let the energy go in and out
27364,10,0,black because that way the dog wont be hot or cold it would not be cold but it wont be hot eighter
27365,10,2,black black will absorb more heat therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year the average temperature inside the ja r with a black lid was 53 degrees celcius while all the other colors had an average of 48 degrees celsius or lower
27366,10,2,dark gray dark gray would heat up the air for a dog to a comfortanble temerature and not make it to hot like the black lid or make it to cold like the light lid
27367,10,1,black because the darker the color the sunlight it attracks because of the solar energy
27368,10,2,black the color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter the color black absorbs heat better than the other colors the experiment results show that black is better because in trial 1temperature was 54 deg c and the coldest for black was 52 deg c the least warmest was the color white the highest temperature was 43 deg c the lowest was 41 deg c i chose black because it will keep the dog the warmest in the cold winter white would not be as warm as black is
27369,10,1,dark gray by painting he dog house the color dark grey might affect the dog house by making it warmer on cold nights but not to hot like the black color will make it i think this because on the result s chart the black is a higher temp than the dark grey and the dark grey also always stays a consistent temp in conclusion i think they sho uld paint the dog house grey because inside it it will niether be to hot nor to cold
27370,10,2,white the white paint would make the inside of the doghouse coolest because according to the experiment the average of each color are black 53 dark gray 48 light gray 45 and white 42
27371,10,2,white white would make a good color for a doghouse because its a rather remains at a rather cool tempertaure not too hot for the poor dogs as seen on lid color vs air temperature for each lid col or table where it shows the average of the white lid's temperture was 42 deg c
27372,10,2,white the darker colors absorb more energy so if you picked black then the temperture would increase in the air for example in the experiment the tempeture went to 54 deg and for the white lid it only went up to 41 deg thats why painting the dog house white is better choice because it wont get so hot in the dog house
27373,10,1,white it will let it be less hotter
27374,10,2,white a white colored doghouse will make the air te mperature warmer in warm temperature but the light color will not mak e the temperature go up a lot with the black lid color the temperature of the air i nside the jar was adn average of 53 deg after ten minutes the white ja r was and average of 42 deg after ten minutes since both jars started at 24 deg the temperature of the black jar increased 29 deg while th e temperature of the white only increased 18 deg the darker the color of something the more heat the object absorbs that means that teh white doghouse will be the coolest doghouse even though that doghouse will wa rm up as well
27375,10,1,dark gray i would say dark gray because when the sun co mes out you don't want your dog to be to warm but not to cold so dark gra y would work perfectly in my opinion
27376,10,2,white the doghouse would have a cooler temperature than one painted in gray or black because the average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42 deg while the average temperatures of the black dark gray and light gray doghouses were 53 deg 48 deg and 45 deg respectively
27377,10,1,black it willbe hotter cose its hot
27378,10,2,white white had the lowest temperature so the dogho use wont get extremely hot
27379,10,1,light gray it might be less hot than a darker lid becaus e black absorbes the most heat
27380,10,1,white brandi and jerry should paint their doghouse white this is because in the summer when the temperature outside gets h otter the inside of the doghouse will be cooler for the dog that is bec ause darker colors absorb more light ad heat energy
27381,10,0,dark gray the dark gray color might affect the doghouse by keeping the doghouse the same temperature throughout the year which i s not too cool but not too hot 48 deg i know this because on the dat a table it shows that throughout all the trials the dark gray was the col or that kept the temperature inside the jar stay the same
27382,10,2,white the white paint would be the best choice for a color of a dog house because after 10 minutes of having a white lid th e air temperature inside the jar was the lowest it seemed that the light er the color the lower average temperature the air inside the jar was af ter 10 minutes this would be the best color for a dog house because if y ou would like to keep your dog cooler in the summertime having a white p ainted dog house would stay much cooler on the inside that if there was a black paint instead
27383,10,2,white painting the doghouse white will raise the temperature only slightly while painting the doghouse a darker color wil l raise the temperature significantly in the lid color vs air temperature inside glass jar data table the temperature inside the jar with the white lid raised an average of 18 deg c from the starting tem perature after 10 minutes the temperature inside the jar with the black colored lid raised an average of 29 deg c from the starting temperature after 10 minutes if brandi and jerry wanted the temperature in the doghouse to be cool then they would paint the doghouse white if they wa nted the temperature to be warm they would paint the doghouse black i w ould paint the doghouse white
27384,10,0,black more dogs like black
27385,10,1,white if they were to use white the dog house would be cooler for the dog to sleep in or just hang out and cause less damages or issues to the dog
27386,10,1,light gray the light gray so its not to hot and not to c old
27387,10,1,light gray i would choose dark gray because on a hot day the dog can stay nice and cool and on a cold day the color is still a ble to absorb some heat the experiment proved that darker colors absorb more heat than lighter so the dark gray color would be the best also in the trials the average temp of the jar is 48 deg c so the dog would be nice and warm in the house
27388,10,2,white the color white might affect the doghouse by being cooler inside than the darker colors because white obsordes less he at than dark colors thats why in brandi and jerry's lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors
27389,10,2,white i choose white because white is the lightest color and it absorb the least heat so inside the dog house will be more c ooler i know this because in the investigation it said white had 42 deg c which is the lowest while the black had 54 deg c which is the highest
27390,10,2,white the lighter color would help keep the doghous e cooler inside for example the jar with the white colored lid was cool er 42 deg than the black lid 53 deg
27391,10,0,light gray because it made a mild temperature in the jar
27392,10,1,white how this color might affect the doghouse is w hen a color is lighter like the color white that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black so when it's going to be really hot outs ide inside the doghouse it will be cool
27393,10,1,light gray this would absorb more thermal energy while still keeping cool because of the lightns of the gray
27394,10,1,black black will affect the doghouse because it wil make the inside hot
27395,10,1,light gray the light gray would keep the dog house at a more even temp because its both a light and dark color so it would atrackt the right amount of sun light and repel just the right amou nt of sun light
27396,10,0,white the doghouse should be white because it has the warmest or cooldest temperture on the average from the table it will be warmer or colder than the other colors so the dog living in the doghouse wont be hot or cold
27397,10,1,dark gray the color will affect the dighouse by not mak ing it to cold and not making it to warm
27398,10,1,white i would make the dog house white because whit e dose not actracte alot of heat so the dog would not be so hot 916
27399,10,1,light gray light grey would be a great color to use on a dog house because the color would not obsorb a lot of heat and and it w ould not be to cold because grey is still a dark color that could obsorb heat when needed
27400,10,2,white white paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins under the light it was the coldest with an average of 42o 11 degrees colder than the hottest pai nt color of black the average of the black paint's air was 53
27401,10,1,white the inside wont be as hott
27402,10,1,dark gray the best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because the temperature inside of the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog but it wouldn't be too cold it was 48 deg c in the jar with a dark gray lid on average that is more suitable for a doghouse th an the black lid which was 53 deg c or the white lid which was 42 deg c
27403,10,0,dark gray dark grey because if you use this color the d og house will be about 48 degrees and the dog house will not be to cold
27404,10,2,dark gray the color dark gray would affect the doghou se because it would stay at a pretty warm temperature this way the dogh ouse would be around 48 deg the doghouse would not be too hot 53 deg as it would be with the color black but the doghouse would not be too cold 42 deg as it would be with the color white
27405,10,0,light gray because the dogs liked their home and the dog feels comfortable
27406,10,0,light gray light gray wouldnt be to hot or to cold so the tem erature would be just right
27407,10,2,black if you use black paint then it will take in m ore heat because dark colors absorb more energy like they found out in th e lab hot lamp the black was at least 5 deg c hotter then all the other colors
27408,10,1,white because it obsorb less heat and energy
27409,10,2,white it wil make it so the air inside of the dogho use will be cooler so the dog dosnt get to hot i knowjthis because the d ata shows the averge temperature for white was 42 deg c
27410,10,1,white less heat in the dog house so there would be much more comfort for the dog
27411,10,2,black this color would make the doghouse warmer bec ause in the experiment the darker the color the warmer it will be inside
27412,10,1,white white is best in this situation as long as i ts not cold out white reflects heat thus the husky or lab or what ever dog or wolf it is stays cool and collect
27413,10,1,light gray the color absorbs enough heat not to be cold in the winter but not to much heat to be hot in the summer
27414,10,1,dark gray it will take in heat in the winter and won't take as much in in the summer as black would
27415,10,1,white white absorbs less heat so it would keep the dog cooler
27416,10,2,light gray light gray is the best color for the dog hous e because it doesn't make the dog house too hot but it also doesn't make the dog house too cold the black had an average temperature of 53 deg c which is too hot for a dog in the summer it needs to be at a rela xing temperature which is 45 deg c for the light gray if i were to choo se the white it would be too cold for the poor dog to be in the light gr ay color would make it so that the dog could be very confortable in his l ittle house
27417,10,2,black the black paint because it will absorb more light energy causing the inside of the dog house to be warmer keeping the dog warm at night the average temperature for the black lid was 53 deg while the white was 42 deg the black paint had the highest temperature out of all colors and was 11 deg higher than the white paint
27418,10,0,white the black color when it gets dark dogs will have a dark doghouse so i just picked white
27419,10,2,black clack absorbs more heat energy so it would m ake the doghouse a warmer place for the dog the average temperature for the black lid was on average about 8 deg c more than the other colored lids that is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with
27420,10,0,white porque es el que da mas inside de glass
27421,10,2,black if the color of the doghouse was black then i t would make the inside of the doghouse warmer inside in the experiment it was 53 deg c on average in the jar when the lid was black and only 42 deg c on average when the lid of the jar was white
27422,10,1,black i think they should use blak beacause it woul d be warmer for the dog
27423,10,0,white the darker colors will absorb heat faster tha n lighter colors
27424,10,0,black black because on a warm day the dog house would heat up but it wouldnt be too hot for the dog and on a cold day the dog house should be the same tempature 53 deg c or get a little col der but not to cold for the animal
27425,10,2,dark gray i chose the dark gray paint color because it would keep the dog warmer in the winter than the white or light gray pain t but cooler in the summer than the black paint would the experiment su pports this because the dark grey paint in the experiment made the inside temperature an average of 48 deg c while the highest average data the black paint was a temperature of 53 deg c too hot and the lowest av erage data the white paint was 42 deg c too cold for the dog
27426,10,0,white white would not attract as much heat as the o ther darker colors
27427,10,2,light gray light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse light gray had an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't b e too cold or too warm for a dog a white doghouse was 42 degrees which m ight make the dog cold and black and dark gray would make the dog too war m dark grays average was 48 and blacks average was 53 much too warm the refore light gray would be the best color
27428,10,0,white if the insid eof the dog house is white then the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
27429,10,0,black if you see the doghouse black then you can se e better because the color is black you can see black better in the after noon
27430,10,2,white i would pick white paint to paint the dog hou se because according to the experiment white was the color that the insid e of the jar would be less hot accordig to brandi and jerry's data the w hite lid had a temperature 42 deg c inside the jar and the black lid was 53 deg c and i dont want my dog to be to hot or sufficate in the dog ho use
27431,10,1,light gray i would chose light gray because in the summe r a black house might over heat the dog however in the winter a white h ouse might be too cool a light gray house would repel heat in the summer and allow more heat in the winter
27432,10,1,dark gray if brandi and jerry colored the doghouse white it would not asorb the heatness like the color black therefore it would feel more comfortable for the dog when it is hot outside the reason why black was to asorb heat because in the data table it had higher degree then white which had a lowest degree in temperature
27433,10,1,light gray the color would keep the doghouse at a perfec t temperature not to hot or not to cold
27434,10,1,black black would be a good color for the dog house because in the day it would get hotter because black absorbs heat causin g it to be warmer in their at night
27435,10,2,black we can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat knowing this information for the dog to be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse brandi and jerry should paint the house black
27436,10,2,white assuming that the location of the doghouse ha s a warm climate the white paint color will be more likely to keep the t emperature of the air inside the doghouse at a cooler or lower temperat ure this can be said because the white paint color on average made the air inside the glass jar a temperature of 42 deg c compared to 53 deg c for black paint 48 deg c for dark gray paint and 45 deg c for light gr ay paint it is vital that the doghouse maintains a low temperature so th at the dog that stays inside the doghouse doesn't overheat
27437,10,2,white they should use white paint because when the sun comes out the doghouse won't get as much heat absorbed as shown in t he table the darker lid they used the hotter the air became and white is the lightest color used and it had the lowest temperature
27438,10,2,dark gray the color will effect the dog house by keepin g it the same temperature which would be cool in the summer and warm in t he winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar t he same temperature for all 3 trials which the average temperature was 48 deg c
27439,10,2,dark gray i think the best color for the dog house is d rrk gray because it's not the hotest color or the coldest which will hel p the dog stay cool but also warm it showed that in each trial the tempe rture was 48 deg c for the dark gray color which mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time also dark gray takes in more heat then white by 6 deg c average
27440,10,2,white it will keep it cooler due to the fact that w hite dosnt abosorb as much heat as dark gray light gray and black also because blacks average in deg c was 53 dark grays average was 48 li ght grays average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42 leaving that white wi ll leave the dog house cooler
27441,10,1,black black would be the best because it keeps the inside of the dog house the warmest and would keep the dog warm and not cold
27442,10,2,black black would be an ideal color to pain the dog house because of the insulation if provides within out of all the colors of white dark gray light gray black and white black had the highest temperature within the glass jar with and average of 53 deg c while the lowest temperature was with the color of white with an average of 42 deg c thus choosing black should make the doghouse warmer because black seemed to have a high temperature than any other however you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed if the doghouse should be placed outdo ors black would be the ideal color to keep the dog warm during cold wint ers if placed indoors the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm
27443,10,2,white white would be the best color because it will be more cooler in the dog house then any of the colors above in t he data table with black paint the average was 53 deg c the w hite paint the average was 42 deg c so that shows that if you go fo r light colors it will reduce the heat inside but if you do want it reall y hot then go for the dark colors
27444,10,0,black 1 the dog will be feeling like fanetting 2 the dog will gett thirsty 3 the dog will breath reeally hard
27445,10,0,white the color should keep the inside of the dog house at a reasonable temperature based on the results from the experiment the hypothesis was right about black soaking up heat through the black rather than white so the white paint would work the same by keeping the heat under control and not letting it all in
27446,10,0,dark gray because dark gray color absorb more energy
27447,10,2,white this color effects the dog house because it m akes it cooler according to the hot lamp experiment in there experiment t he white lid was the coolest
27448,10,2,white the best color to paint the top of the doghou se would be white in the experiment on average the black lid absorbed 5 3 deg c dark gray 48 deg c light gray 45 deg c white 42 deg c the black lid absorbed 11 deg more heat than the white lid by painti ng the top of the doghouse white it decreases the amount of heat getting traped within the doghouse
27449,10,0,white how white would affect the doghouse is that i t would get drityer more easly thats how it would affect the doghouse
27450,10,2,light gray in there experiment they found out that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use a light grey for the dog house because it doesnt absorb a lot of heat and it will stay nice and cool inside but it will let absorb some heat but it will be just the right tempature
27451,10,1,dark gray black because it will get to hot
27452,10,1,light gray light gray because it wont make the inside of the dog house to hot because the dog already has a large coat of fur and dark gray wont over heat the dog house
27453,10,1,white the lighter the color the less heat will be inside the dog house the darker the color more heat will be inside the dog house
27454,10,1,white so that the dog can be fresh not hot over the summer and its not too cold for the winter
27455,10,0,dark gray i chose dark gray because where i live it can get fairly cold the dark gray might offer the dog warmth during the winter and at night without over heating the doghouse and hopefully in the summer the dog will be able to run around and wont have to worry about getting to hot in the doghouse then i think your question is too vague it really depends on the climate and dog breed
27456,10,1,white i would choose white because i would want my dog to not have all that heat trapped up in a little tiny space that hot air which is absorbed through dark colors i wouldn't want my dog sitting in that i would want him to be cool so thats why i choose the white col or as a paint for a doghouse
27457,10,2,white based on the data white had the lowest tempe rature average of 42 while others have an average of 45 48 and 53 it all depends on the dog you are getting if its fur is dark better to ge t light colors so it can be cooler
27458,10,1,black this color would keep the inside of the dogs house warm because dark colors attract heat from the son
27459,10,1,white the color white does not absorb as much heat as a darker color and the doghouse wont get as hot
27460,10,1,light gray it can keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter
27461,10,2,white white has less heat absorbtion if the sun is out and it is hot the dog house will still be cool inside white has a t emperature in the low 40's for sitting under a lamp for 10 minutes light gray has temperatures in the mid 40's dark gray is high 40's and black is low to mid 50's
27462,10,0,black they sould use black because black keeps heat better than the other colors so the dont want there dog to get cold so b lack is the most affective color
27463,10,1,dark gray the temperature will stay the same in the col d and hot weather the temperature will never be too hot or too cold
27464,10,2,white white would affect the doghouse because accor ding to the results of the experiment trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54 deg dark gray made it 48 deg light gray made it 44 deg and white made it 42 deg they should choose white be cause it would keep the doghouse the coolest that way the dog doesn't ov erheat
27465,10,2,white the white lid had the lowest temperature and the black lid had the highest temperature so they would use white so when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the dog house wont get hot because the white paint will deflect the heat
27466,10,2,white white because the data showed the tempatures of each of the lids and from the data table it shows that black 53degr ees was the highest and white 42degrees was the lowest so if they wan t a to paint the dog house they should paint it white do to the tempa ture of the dog house wont be to hot for the dog to be in
27467,10,0,white this color could keep the doghouse cool in di rect sunlight this could make it more comfertable for the animal
27468,10,0,white i choose white because if the doghouse is out side then the white would absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm with out overheating it
27469,10,2,black the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy black is the warmest in the investigation for the lamp and colo r of the lid it got an average of 53 deg c the lightest color white got an average of 42 deg c
27470,10,1,dark gray a dark gray color would absorb more heat then light gray and white making it warmer but not as much as black so it won t get too warm
27471,10,2,black black would keep the doghouse warmer during cold winters because it holds more heat than the white or the grays the average for the black was 53 deg c and the white was 42 deg c that means the black holds about 11 degrees more of heat
27472,10,1,white with white the temperaturein the dog house wo uld stay nice andd cool in the summer
27473,10,2,white the color white would affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler than any other of the colors i know this because in th e experiment the white colored lid had a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid had a change of temperature of 29
27474,10,1,white the doghouse will usually be cool inside even on sunny days because the light from the sun will reflect off of the dog house causing the light to not enter it and make the transformation into thermal heat energy
27475,10,2,white if the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler because in the data of the experiment the average temperature of white is 42 deg c and blacks average is 53 deg c
27476,10,2,white that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summer time i know this because in the experiment the black lid had an average of 53 and white had an average of 42 so thats more than a 10 deg c difference
27477,10,1,light gray light gray because its not hot or cold but a little warmer than white
27478,10,1,black it will keep the dog house warmer because the black attracks heat
27479,10,1,black the color black because it would be warm in t he doghouse since black absorbs more heat black would be best to keep th e dog warm rather than cold
27480,10,1,white i think the dog house should be white becaus e in the experiment white didnt get very hot the highest temperature wa s 43 deg c and the lowest was 41 deg c
27481,10,2,dark gray if brandi and jerry used the color dark gray for their doghouse that would be the best color because it would keep the doghouse warm and cool depending on the seasons the color dark gray in the jar experiment had an average of 48 deg c that makes the temp erature of the doghouse in general not to hot and not to cool based on t he jar experiment
27482,10,2,white white will make the doghouse cooler than a da rker color such as black because in the data table it shows that the aver age temperature inside the jar with a white lid was 42 deg c and inside the black lid it was 53 deg c that is 11 deg c warmer
27483,10,2,black if he choses black the doghouse will get more hot air because in the story the black color gets more heat because its darker
27484,10,2,white it would make it cooler in there for the dog because white and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then dark er colors for example the average for the black lid was 53 deg c but the average for the white lid was only 42 deg c which is a lot less so i think brandi and jerry should go with painting their doghouse white
27485,10,2,white a white dog house will absorb heat the worst so it will be cooler inside i know this because in the experiment the bl ack lid got to be the hottest at 54 deg c well white was the coolest at 42 deg c white was also cooler then dark gray at 48 deg c and light gr ay at 44 deg c so white would be the coolest for the doghouse
27486,10,1,black the dog house if painted black will be warmer because the color black atracts heat
27487,10,0,light gray the light grey will effect the doghouse by ma king it more noticable and plus dogs can only see black white and grey
27488,10,1,light gray it can make it hot but not to hot cause it do nst atract as much heat as black or dark gray
27489,10,1,black the darker the color the more heat it absorbs haveing a black dog house would make it warm on the inside
27490,10,2,white brandi and jerry predicted that the darker th e lid color the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar becuase darker colors absorb more energy their hypothesis was correct this is because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the bl ack lid after three ten minute trials was 53 degrees but the average temp erature inside the glass jar with the white lid after three ten minute tr ials was 42 degrees because black was the darkest color of the lid it a bosrbed the most heat so the air temperature was highest and vice versa for the white lid thus because we don't want the doghouse to be overhe ated the best color to paint it would be white because white would absor b the least heat
27491,10,2,black the color black will affect the doghouse by m aking it a warmer environment for the dog plus if it is a cold winter t he doghouse will help to keep the dog warmer the data table shows that u sing the black lid color the air temperature was clearly around 12 deg higher then the white lid about 10 deg higher in temperature than the light gray lid and about 6 deg higher in temperature than the dark gray lid each trial the average temperature was 53 deg c for the black lid the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48 deg c the average tem perature for the light gray lid was 45 deg c and the average temperatur e for the white lid was 42 deg c it shows the black lid absorbs more he at to keep the doghouse warmer
27492,10,0,black is to dark
27493,10,1,white white would be the best color for a dog house because according to this expiriment whit absorbs the most heat with an average temperature of 42 deg c compared to the black paint which had an average tempurature of 53 25 deg c making the dog house a cooler place to live
27494,10,1,black if the doghouse is black than the inside will be warmer when there is sun shining on it so the dog will stay warm
27495,10,1,light gray light gray would allow the dog house to absorb heat though not as much as black so it would not be incredibly h ot but it would still be warmer than white also it wouldnt be as cold as the white but would be cooler than the black so light grey is the perfect color to be not quite hot and not quit e cold and just the right temperature to make the dog house comfortable for the dog
27496,10,1,white the color white reflects most of the sun's he at while the color black absorbs most of the sun's heat
27497,10,2,white the best paint color for the doghouse would be white inside of the doghouse the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted black or gray the average temperature for the black lid was 53 deg c but for the white lid it was 42 deg c the white lid made the air 11 deg cooler than the black lid
27498,10,0,white white cause black makes heat worse and so i c hose white because every dog house is white because its easier to see in the dark and its comfy and warm
27499,10,1,black the darker the color the greater the increase in the air temperature in the dog house because darker colors absorb mor e energy
27500,10,1,white white will ceep the doghouse cooler
27501,10,0,black black will affect the dog house buy keeping h eat in
27502,10,0,black brings heat in the dog house
27503,10,1,white white doesn't attract heat but black dark gray and light gray do so the dog would be kept cool
27504,10,1,dark gray dark gray would keep the temperature of the doghouse constant and it wouldnt be too hot or to cold
27505,10,0,dark gray dark gray will keep the dog house the same te mp in the summer and winter as long as therer is light
27506,10,1,white white is the best becouse it is the coolest and would not over heat he dog
27507,10,2,light gray if you paint the dog house black then the in side will always very hot then when the sun is shining on it just like in the lab it says the the darker the color the gr eater the increase in air inside the doghouse so i would not choose blac k to be the color for the dog house i would pick light grey because it i s dark but at the same time it is a light color when the sun is shining or giving heat to the dog house it will be warm but cool at the same tim e because it is a light color and a light color does not obsorve as much heat
27508,10,1,light gray if the doghouse is light gray then in the win ter it will be slightly warmer than the actual temperature and in the sum mer it will be slightly cooler than the actual temperature
27509,10,1,light gray based off the results you would want this co lor because it doesn't attract to much heat and it wouldn't be to cold at the same time
27510,10,1,light gray i think light gray would be the best because it wouldn't be too hot or cold
27511,10,2,white the white dog house will not make the dog as hot inside because white is a very bright color but black is a dark colo r so it will get hotter in the xperiment when the black cap was on the t emperture was hotter than having the white cap on
27512,10,2,light gray i choose light gray because light gray isnt t oo light and is not too dark light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature if it was white it would be too cold and if it was black then it would be too hot in the experiment light gray ha d an average temperature of 45 deg c while white had 42 deg c and black had 53 deg c
27513,10,1,white brandi and jerry should use white paint for t here dog house because in the investagation the white paint color only ha d a 18 deg increase as black paint had a 29 deg increase the diffren ce between the two paint's tempurture was 11 deg
27514,10,2,white white would be the best color for a dog house because it absorbs the least amount of heat in summer you wouldn't wan t the dog house to be over heated the white color had an average of 42 deg c while the black color was 53 deg c this is a difference of 11 deg c between the two colors
27515,10,1,black the color black would make the house warmer o n the inside
27516,10,2,white i think that white would be a good color bec ause in brandi and jerry's expeirement white gave a cooler temperature t han the others so the doghouse could be colder than warmer
27517,10,1,dark gray this color would allow the house to collect s ome heat without it being to hot since gray is lighter then black but no t to light
27518,10,2,light gray this color would affect the doghouse by being dark enough to let heat in during cold seasons and being light enou gh to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days on average the heat inside the jar with a light gray 45 deg c was cooler than tha t of black 53 deg c and dark gray 48 deg c
27519,10,1,white so if it is hot out side and the dog wants to go in side the dog house then it will be cooler because the color of the dog house is white
27520,10,1,light gray it depends on the dog if the dog has medium amount of hair then the best color would probably be light gray because i t doesnt obsorb that much heat energy but if the dog was a hairless one then it would be best to go with black so that way the dog could get enou gh heat in the doghouse
27521,10,1,dark gray dark grey will make the dog house warm inside but it wont get to hot for the dog in the jar the air tempature insde t he jar with the dark grey lid stayed at 48 there for in the dog house it wont be to cold or to hot it will be warm
27522,10,2,white white could be a color for the doghouse it wouldn't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is also in the experiment white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors 42 deg c 43 deg c 41 deg c and 42 deg c where as the other colors black dark gray and light gray all had higher temperatures the temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54 deg c the color black to the lowest te mperature 41 deg c for the color white
27523,10,2,black the color black is going to make the doghouse more warm because darker colors absorb more energy
27524,10,1,black the darker the color is the hotter the doghou se would be the lighter the doghouse is the cooler the doghouse would be inside
27525,10,0,white it will keep the temp in the 40 deg area c deg and not burn up the dog inside the dog house
27526,10,2,white the color white might affect the doghouse bec ause the dog won't get too hot in the summer because the weather is warme r in the summer and white is the coolest color out of the four white was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees
27527,10,2,light gray choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color it wouldn't be to hot or to cold for the dog during the experiment the black lid produced a very hot temerature o f 53 deg c the white lid created a temperature of 42 deg c choosing the light gray color would be a good medium
27528,10,2,white white might affect the inside of the dog hous e because it went up only 20 degrees from the starting temperature i th ink white is the best paint color to use because it had the lowest tempe ratures and it doesnt absorb alot of energy
27529,10,2,white white would make the dog house less hot the data table shows that the white paint kept the jar cooler than the other paint in trial 1 2 and 3
27530,10,0,white becuse dog can ony see black and white so that will affect the dog house
27531,10,2,white the color white wouldn't absorb as much ener gy as the darker colors so the doghouse wouldn't become too warm with a black lid the jar was an average temperture was 53 deg c after 10 minu tes with the white lid the temperature was an average of 42 deg c thi s shows that the lighter the color the less heat you will have trampted inside the dog house something to warm would not be suitable for a dog and therefore making white the right color
27532,10,0,light gray light gray how it might affect the doghouse i s that the lighting could be so powerful from the light that the color mi ght get really hot well the dog house might get really hot
27533,10,2,light gray i think light gray will be the best for the d og because in the summer it will not too warm hot and winter not too co ld since the data prove that the darker the object the more it will abso rb the energy which gain or lose heat based the color and since the aver age data of light gray is about in the middle which was 45 deg c
27534,10,2,white a white color would keep it cooler because a ccording to the data white has the lowest average temperature of 42 degr ees celcius while black has the highest average temperature of 53 degree s celcius
27535,10,1,light gray based on the data i think light grey would be the best color i think that because it would make the doghouse warm fo r the winter but it wont be too hot in the summer
27536,10,1,light gray a light gray would make the dog house warm bu t not too cold like when it is raining you don't want to have a white dog house the average for the black colored lid was 53 deg c which is too hot and the dark gray was 48 deg c which is still a little too hot and t he average for the light gray is 45 deg c and the white was 42 deg c so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends o n the dog so if you had a shaved or close to shaved dog you would maybe e ven want a dark gray dog house but if you had a dog with a lot of hair yo u would want a white dog house
27537,10,1,white the white color would absorb the least amount of heat in the doghouse meaning it would be great for summer but if yo u want the warmer house in the winter the black doghouse should do the t rick
27538,10,0,black really black
27539,10,2,white if you use white paint color to paint a dog h ouse it would be the best choice to keep the dog cool during a hot day in the experiment out of the 4 tested lid colors white held out to be th e one with the lowest temperature
27540,10,1,white this color might affect the doghouse because since white doesn't absorb any heat the dog house inside will be cool eno ugh for the dog to be in darker color absorbs more energy and since whit e is the lightest color of all the colors there will be no energy absorbe d
27541,10,0,white this will help the dog so it wont get hot in the summer
27542,10,1,dark gray the color might affect the dog house by giving the doghouse more heat in the inside but also not giving to much heat inside the doghouse dark gray will attract at an average about 48 deg c of heat the black color has to much heat about 53 deg c and the color white has to little of heat at about 42 deg c so therefore the dark gray would be best for the color of the doghouse
27543,10,2,black the more dark the dog house iis the hoter it will be in the dog house so if it was black it would be hot in it like in the experiment when the kid was black it was 53 dagrees c and when the l id was white it was 42 dagrees
27544,10,2,white the color of the doghouse should be white because that way in the summer it won't be to hot for the dog as shown in the data white is the coolest the average for a black lid is 53 deg c the dark gray lid is 48 deg c the light gray lid is 45 deg c and the white lid is 42 deg c therefore the white is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog
27545,10,1,white with a white doghouse the dog will be cool when the weather is warm hot because the white paint will not absorb as much heat and in the winter it will not matter because there is not much heat to absorb anyway so it would not matter how dark the paint is
27546,10,1,black the color black whould be the best color to paint the dog house because you will have a higher temperature with a darker color it will have a warmer there will be a higher chance for the doghouse to be at a higher temperature
27547,10,1,black it will keep it hot because black absorbes the suns rays faster then a lighter coller
27548,10,1,white the air temperature will be lower on average because in the experiment white kept the temperature inside the jar the l owest
27549,10,1,light gray this color will affect the doghouse by heatin it but not overheating the doghouse
27550,10,1,white white because white reflects sun and u want i t to be cold in a dog house for a dog
27551,10,2,dark gray dark gray would be a good color because it wo uldn't be too cold nor to hot in the experiment the dark gray jar was in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the wa rmest like black but somewhat in the middle with an average temp of 48 deg c
27552,10,1,white the dog house would stay cooler because white doesn't attract the that much heat
27553,10,2,white the color white had the lowist temp at the en d of the expairement so that means it will be cooler inside the dog house then it would be with other colors
27554,10,1,dark gray it wold make it cooler in the sumer but warme r in the winter because the dark coler would atraket the heat
27555,10,2,white white would be better for the doghouse becaus e it doesnt absorb that much energy like black and dark gray did white o nly absorbed an average of 42 deg c where black absorbed an average of 53 deg c
27556,10,2,dark gray dark gray would be the best color for the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold darker colors attract more heat than light so dark gray wouldn't be too hot or cold in an air temperatur e expirement four colors were measured black dark gray light gray an d white the data measured black as 53 deg c dark gray as 48 deg c li ght gray 45 deg and white 42 deg c dark gray as you see isn't too wa rm neither too cold making it the best color for the doghouse
27557,10,2,white using white paint would make the doghouse col der than if they used black paint as was shown by the table the average temperature of the jar with a black lid was 53 deg c while the average temperature of the jar with a white lid was 42 deg c the jar with the black lid was 11 deg c warmer than the jar with the white lid thus usi ng white paint would also make the doghouse colder than using black paint and brandi and jerry should use white paint
27558,10,1,white white will make the dog house cooler because it reflects the most light
27559,10,2,white the black was 9 deg c warmer then the white colored paint the black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog the white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer
27560,10,2,white painting the dog house white will keep the inside cooler then the black paint job by 11 deg c the average temperature for the black lid jar air was 53 deg c where as the average temperature for the white lid jar air was an average of 42 deg c
27561,10,2,white white you be the best color for brandi and je rry's dog house because acording to their experiment white absorbs less energy than darker colors therefor brandi and jerry's dog would be able to stay cool in warm weather
27562,10,0,dark gray it won't be too hot or too cold in the dog ho use
27563,10,0,white bright colers reflect the light so the dog wi ll not get so hot
27564,10,1,black the color black would keep the the dog warm
27565,10,1,light gray the color wouyld affect the dog house in this way in the heat the dog would stay cool but its not so light that it wou ld be cold for him in the winter so keeping it at a light darker color y ou ahve a mixeture of the 2
27566,10,2,light gray a light gray paint on the doghouse might prov ide some heat in the winter while not making it too hot in the summer t hat is shown by the data in the 20 deg c increase in temp dark g ray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer because of th e average increases of 24 deg c for dark gray and 29 deg c fo r black a white paint would not provide much heat during the winter sho wn by the meager 18 deg c increase however on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable the doghouse would not likely be made of glass a nd sealed off from outside air curculation also the sun burns many diff erent gases providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp in addit ion to being brighter the doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof made of wood and shingles a note you could have interchangable roofs on the do ghouse one of each color and circulate them during the year with white in the summer and black in the winter and the other two scattered betwe en
27567,10,1,white i think it would be white because then when i t is hot out side then it would wouldnt be as hot in the dog house then i t would be when the dog house is white
27568,10,2,light gray it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an a verage of 45 deg celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3 deg celsius making an 8 deg celsius difference between the two
27569,10,2,black the color black will be more warmer inside than any other colors above thus brandi and jerry should paint th dog ho use black according to the results from the experiment the color black had the highest average air temperature of 53 the darker the color the warmer the air temperature was in the glass jar because darker colors absorb more energy
27570,10,2,black the black paint might make the dog house abso rb more heat making the dog house warmer i think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results the black pa int retained the most heat in the glass jar
27571,10,0,white because white dose not atract anything
27572,10,1,white white would be better because during the summ er it would be cool with a white dog house and it would be hot and humid with a black dog house
27573,10,1,dark gray it will warm the dog house but not get it to warm
27574,10,2,light gray light gray would be a little cool in tempatur e as the black or dark gray one would get to hot and the white one would get a little cold
27575,10,1,light gray in all seasons the doghouse will stay at a comfortable temperature in the warmer weather the color won't absorb as much heat keeping the doghouse cool during the colder seasons the dog will still have a warmer area and with the dogs fur he would stay nice and warm
27576,10,2,white the white paint color would be cooler becaus e on a sunny hot day the dog might be really hot so the dog would just g o in his dog house the white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat ther efor the inside of the dog house would be allot cooler than being in the sun the experiment tells it all the white after only 10 minutes got up to 40 deg c as the other colors went up to 45 48 and 53 the dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest coming to a solution the white p aint would be the best to use for a dog house
27577,10,2,black white would keep the doghouse the coldest ar ound 40 if the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties if th e doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties if the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties if the doghouse was black it wou ld be in the low fifties white would reflect the light and not heat up t he doghouse as much as any other color
27578,10,0,white it does not atract as much lite as a darker c olor
27579,10,1,black because black absorbs heat more then the othe r colors
27580,10,1,white the color white absorbs less heat therefore w ill reduce the impact the sun has on the temperature inside the doghouse
27581,10,1,black the color black prevents more cold and absorb s more thermal energy making it a warmer place for the dog
27582,10,1,light gray light gray might affect the inside of the dog house because dark colors attract the sun and you do not want the dog to be too hot but then you dont want white so the dog is not too cold so t he average temperature for light gray is a good temperature for an living environment
27583,10,2,light gray painting the doghouse light gray would keep t he doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter i know this beca use the data tells you that the lighter the color of the glass jar the c ooler the inside of the jar is and the darker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the glass jar
27584,10,1,white white becuase if you live in a hot place the dog house will be less hot because white reflect most of the light off of the dog house
27585,10,1,light gray this color will affect the doghouse for the b est the darker color keeps in heat but sometimes heat isn't always good i found a compromise that can keep heat in and has a somewhat high air t emperature but won't be to hot for the dog
27586,10,1,light gray i think light gray would work the best becaus e if its hot outside the house will manage to stay cool inside and in the winter it will manage to stay warm inside
27587,10,1,dark gray if they painted the doghouse dark gray then the doghouse would stay warm because in trials 1 3 the temperatures stay ed at 48 deg c
27588,10,0,white the black would affect the doghouse because t he sun is attracted to black so if the sun is beating down on the doghou se to long it is possible that the dog could over heat of get very sick something eles could happen to the dog that is sleeping in the doghouse
