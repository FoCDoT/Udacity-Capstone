1673,1,1,the procedures i think they should have included inorder for me to replicate the experiment would be how different samples did they used for each what tool did they use to determine the mass
1674,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how many ml of vinegar they used how much distilled water to rinse the samples with and how they obtained the mass of each sample
1675,1,3,in order to replicate their experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you are pouring into each of the containers as well as what kind of samples we are going to measure it should state specifically marble limestone wood and plastic it should also tell us on what the rocks samples will sit on as different materials may compromise the results the last thing that would be needed to replicate this experiment is to tell us what kind of containers the samples should be put in such as wooden boxes glass test tubes ziploc bags etc
1676,1,0,pleace a simple of one material into one container and label it repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container
1677,1,0,determin the mass of four different samples marble limestone wood plastic they all have starting mass and end mass and the diffrence the wood has the most mass but marble has the most diffrence in mass
1678,1,2,in order to repeat the experiment you would need to know what you are testing for they never say the reason for the experiment you need to know how much vinegar they used because that should be the same for each container also in their procedure they dont tell what the samples aren't if you only had the procedure and not the graph you wouldnt be able to replicate is because you dont know what they were testing in the vinegar
1679,1,0,to replicate this experiment you would need four new samples you would also need more vinegar and new containers to do the experiment in
1680,1,1,after reading the procedure there is a lot more information that they need in order to replicate this experiment they should say how much vinegar to put into the container and which container to put it in they should be more specific when stating how things should be measured by saying 'measure mass on a tripple beam balance etc
1681,1,3,after reading the group's procedures i would need to know the exact amount of vinegar in each container this important because it could affect how much of the sample is dissolved i would also need to know were to store the containers in a cold or hot room with light or dark also i would need to know the formula for finding the difference incase i didn't know it is a common error to subtract the wrong masses finally i would need to know how long to rinse each sample and whether to dry the samples under light or not this would affect its weight
1682,1,2,after reading the groups procedure i would need to know the names of the three samples being tested in the experiment the amount of the sample being poured into the containers would also be necessary as well as the amount of distilled water being used to rinse each sample another important factor would be to know the location of samples were placed in to sit and dry for 30 minutes how the students recorded the mass would also be needed to replicate the experiment
1683,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to determine the mass and then label each of the four containers i would also need to put the same amount of vinegar in each container the last additional changes i would do is to clean up gather my materials first and then determine which material is right for solving my problem
1684,1,1,what the hypothesis is what they are trying to prove how much vinegar is needed and added to each sample what can be used as a constant
1685,1,1,after reading the groups procedure the additional information i conclude that they need for me to replicate the experiment is where do you put the samples when you replace them from the containers and how to determine the mass
1686,1,3,to replicate the group's experiment the procedure would have to state how much vinegar was poured into the containers also they should specify what kinds of containers they were using as this could affect the results in the procedure they also failed to tell what 4 samples were used in the experiment a key variable to it's success
1687,1,1,some information that i would need to replicate the experiment are a list of the materials id need to know how to determine the mass because those things are not stated in the procedure
1688,1,2,to replicate this experiment the person would need to state how much vinegar to use how they re going to determine the mass of the end and how long to rinse of the samples with water
1689,1,3,information that would be required to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar to be poured in each container the size or amount of each sample of material and where to store the sample when they are drying from the vinegar
1690,1,0,the student should have stated in the hypothesis that they predicted and correct or not also they should have added what could've went wrong in the experiment and what should they have worked on to make better
1691,1,2,in the procedure there is not enough information for someone to replicate this experiment the procedure should include namingine four samples that need to be determined and how much vinegar needs to be poured in the containers the students should also state what they will be measuring when determining the mass these three things could improve the procedure of the experiment
1692,1,2,one piece of information that i would add is how much vinigar to use in each container the 2nd piece i would add is how big the container should be a third piece of information that i would add to this experiment is to tell the person to mark all the information down into a nice organized table
1693,1,0,for me to be able to replicate this experiment i would just have to follow the procedure over again for example i would have to determine the mass of all four samples next i would pour the vinegar in each of four separate containers and act
1694,1,0,additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is you would need to know the data collected from before another thing you would need is to know the collected information on last and final thing you would need to know is what happened after the next before having it out for 30 mins what was in the when you pilled it out
1695,1,0,in this experiment i would also include how it looked after 24 hours why the mass went down and why you would put the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes
1696,1,1,you would need a list of things to get supplies those would include such things as a scale cups the samples vinegar and distilled water another thing needed was the names of the samples themselves in the question and there is no reason or problem stated
1697,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the samples you're using are in step 1 it says to determine the mass of four different samples also in step 3 it tells you to place each sample in a different container however you are never told what the samples are that you are using
1698,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers i would need to know this because if i just poured vinegar into four cups the amounts would be different and it could change the results of my expierement
1699,1,1,any additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar to use so there are same amount in each container how much water to rinse 4 with because to little might not wash off all the vinegar and to much might wash off some of the materials and affect the final mass also students may need to know what unit to measure the materials in so they can get almost exactly what the other group got
1700,1,2,to replicate this experiment i would need to find out what kind of containers i need i would also need to know what to put the samples on to sit and dry finally i would need to find out what the students used to obtain the mass of the samples
1701,1,3,the procedure is very unclear in order to replicate this experiment the procedure must be more specific for example instructions must be made about how much vinegar must you pour into the containers what kind of containers should be used specify what the four samples are in the procedure
1702,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you need to add to the procedure first you'd need to know what four samples to use how much of the sample to use how much vinegar to add to the sample decide what container to put the sample in and how much distilled water is used to rinse the sample
1703,1,2,to be able to separate this experiment their needs to be more information in the procedure the students should be specified for amount of vinegar added to the samples the students should've added that the experiment should be repeated to be sure the results were correct the last thing that was missing from the procedure is a list of the four samples being used
1704,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment they must supply more specific information for example they should list the four different sample names second they should give the size of the container last they must specify how much vinegar and the possible strength of that vinegar
1705,1,2,after reading the groups procedure information that needs to be included is tell what they are taking samples of another thing they should include to how much vinegar they are mixing with each sample the final thing they should include is about how much of each sample to use those would be needed to replicate the experiment
1706,1,2,well the procedure does not state what the four samples are and you need to know that in order to do anything you also need to know how much vinegar should be used and you would need to know whether the samples are placed into the same containers as the ones with vinegar
1707,1,1,you would need to know how much vinegar you need to put into each container you need to have a control sample after washing the sample do you put it back into the container
1708,1,2,give the amount of each sample needed for the experiment have the amount of vinegar needed to the experiment give the amount of freely to rinse and how long do varies and should the all same time and what temperature was the water
1709,1,2,to replicate this experiment i would need to know what the control was if there even was one to begin with the measurements for the vinegar and amount of each material placed in the vinegar are also left out the names of the materials should also be mentioned in the procedure
1710,1,2,after reading the group's procedure the additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be the different samples used how much vinegar is going to be poured into each of the containers and what should the containers be labled
1711,1,1,in order for me to replicate the experiment i would need o know how much vinegar to pour in each cup and how much f one substance without doing that it can effect each substance differently
1712,1,2,the procedureshould explain what the samples are the procedure should say to calculate the difference in mass of each substance the procedure should explain how much vinegar to use
1713,1,1,some additional informatio would of bee what four examples should we whaz or what adding vinegar to the samples as getting to do
1714,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know what materials the samples are made of step number three would need to be revised to say that each sample has it's own cup of vinegar also an amount of vinegar was not determined a constant starting mass should have been used between the four materials because the vinegar may have ecoded more of one material due to a larger amount of surface area
1715,1,2,some additional information that you would need to replicate this experiment would be things like the mass of each of the samples before they were put in the vinegar the temperature of the vinegar when it was put in the cup with the samples the size of the containers that the sample and solution were in and the amount of vinegar that they put in the cups and also weather they did multiple trails or not
1716,1,0,you would need the nishpoping and you would need to know were they got the number from
1717,1,1,how much vinegar do you put into the containers take out materials determine the mass with a triple beam balance
1718,1,1,to replicate this experiment i need to know the materials and how to find the mass because one cannot assume that another person knows what they are doing
1719,1,0,at least include three piece of information in order to replicate the experiment the procedure are determine the mass of four defferent samples pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers place a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container after 24 hours remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water determine the mass of each sample
1720,1,1,in the procedure it should state how to determine the mass of each material also it should state the amount of vinegar poured into the container
1721,1,2,three pieces of information needed to replicate the experiment are 1 amount of vinegar poured into the containers 2 size of samples marble limestone wood plastic and 3 how much distilled water is used to rinse the samples
1722,1,1,to replicate this experiment it would be important to know how much vinegar should be poured into the four containers in step 2 this is unclear therefore the amount of vinegar should be specified next the group should specify how much a single sample is the samples should be constant therefore results are comparable the group should decide on a certain mass sample to use for the four materials lastly to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with right now this information is vague
1723,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i believe that the group needs to include more information on the sample they need to say where the samples are being stored during the 24 hours and at what temperature based on this given information the could be located outdoors or indoors where the temp would effect the rock sample also they must include the amount of vinegar used in the container they simply tell us to pour vinegar but never include an amount
1724,1,1,to determine the mass put what form of weight system your weighing it on grams pounds etc when pouring the vinegar put what you'll be measuring witer ml liters etc be none describtive when labeling samples
1725,1,1,you would need to know how much vinigar to put in you would need to know what the group is testing you would also need to know what the group is testing for what is their statement
1726,1,1,some additional information that i would need is i was to replicate this experiment is what samples to get they would need to say we got all four samples then heated them another piece of information that i may need is to find out the difference in mass from befor and after the experiment and last is to have a step that says to release the scale so that the mass can be removed
1727,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment the procedure would need to include the amount of vinegar used in each cup we would also need to know what the samples are while the data table identifies them it is not clear from the procedure what we are testing also we would need to know exactly what it is were testing the procedure should include something about recording the starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass
1728,1,1,in order to replicate the expiment you must have to mention the four types of samples list the mass and after you have you see the difference in mass and double with the information of the results of the mass
1729,1,1,the additional information i would need in other to replicate the experiment is to named the sample that i would have used in the expeement
1730,1,1,i would add how much vinegar is being added to the four containers i would also add more samples to the lab and i would repeat the lab again to see if i get the same answers
1731,1,3,the first thing i would have to know is what are my samples going to be of i would also want to know how much vinegar i'm suppose to pour in each container i also would need to know what type of container i'm to store the samples in
1732,1,3,1 determine the mass of four different samples marble limestone wood and plastic p 2 pour 20ml of vinegar in each of four seperate but identical beakers p 3 place a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container place all of containers in the same place
1733,1,0,you would also need beakers and test tube and a timer
1734,1,3,you would need to know how much vinegar needed for each container also how big the containers are that you need to put the materials in to ensure that they fit the placement of the containers is important because if they are left in the sun when they shouldn't be it could change the results how much distilled water one needs to put into each container is important to know too
1735,1,0,besides knowing the procedure in order to replicate this experiment i would have to know what the problem is that we are trying to solve that way i could make sure i am coming up with the right information to answer the problem another piece of information i would have to know is if there is a control group this is because if there was one i could compare my data from the different samples to the control group also i would have to know what the control variables are because if all of the variables that need to be controlled are not that my information would not be as valid as it could be
1736,1,3,to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to add in each container and how big each containers it also doesn't let you know how big each sample should be or what type of material plus it should remind people to wear goggles and clean up their area
1737,1,3,the additional information that i would need to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar that was pored into each container the temperature of vineger how long and visarable the samples should be rinsed number of trials type of container the sample should be placed in and what types of equipment should be used to determine the mass
1738,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in the four containers
1739,1,0,you wouldn't need any additional information that prscjar was correct and could be duplicated the way it is presented in the procedure
1740,1,3,what kind of vinegar how much vinegar what kind of surrounding do you dry the samples
1741,1,2,after reading this group procedure i would need to know how many units of vinegar should be added to each cup which samples to test not what the starting mass for each sample should be these three factors were left out and these factors are vital to the experiment
1742,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment the students should add more procedures they would double the hours to see what would happen repeat the experiment and not rinse the samples with distilled water and don't dry the samples
1743,1,2,to replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar was used for the samples to sit in we would also need to know what the samples were that we were testing in order for the experiment to work and we would also need to know that we should be recording all of the data that we were collecting we would also need to know that we should subtract the differences in masses to be able to compare the results
1744,1,0,the additional information you will need is at the end say to record what you have found out also i would say has with distilled water to use to use plan's ruin anything
1745,1,2,1 the amount of metrials that you need p 2 how much vinegar do you pour
1746,1,1,the additional information needed would be if there was a constant variable if there was a certain temperature that the samples sat in and how they got the difference in mass
1747,1,1,i think that i would need the timing because i guess they have to take the time and i also think that i need the measure of the four mass samples and how big were the materials
1748,1,2,i would need to know what four different samples to use what kind of containers to put them in and i would also need to know how to find the mass of each of the samples after they dried without this information i could not replicate this lab
1749,1,3,the procedure needs to state what samples to use instead of asking the reader refer to the data for exact data the procedure must also state how much vinegar to use also step three doesn't state whether or not to put the samples in the water but separate containers as the vinegar
1750,1,0,need to know how much weight of the sample to start with how much acid rain should be put in the test tubes
1751,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container this would allow the experiment to work adiguity if one container had more vinagar than the other then the experiment would fail
1752,1,2,when the procedure says pour vinegar in each container you don't know how much vinegar to put in also when it says place a sample of one material i don't know how much that is to put in the container it also doesn't say how big the container has to be
1753,1,0,the i v d v control variables and constant variables must be included in the procedure
1754,1,2,in order to make this experiment replicable you would need to be more specific for step number three it should clarify which sample and how much of it to place in the container they should add a step between three and four saying where to place he samples for 24 hours for the last step they should explain how to determine the mass by using a triple beam balance
1755,1,3,one thing that would be helpful to be able to replicate this experiment would be to know how much vinegar to pour in the containers and how big the containers are they should have also told us what the materials were that they were using and how much of it to use another thing that should have been included was how they are going to determine the mass of everything
1756,1,3,1 you would need to know the four types of samples in this experiment p 2 you need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four containers p 3 you need to know what temperatures to have the samples in room warm cold
1757,1,3,to replicate the experimenty you would need to know the amount of vinegar placed in each container you would also need to know the temperature at which the containers were stored in addition you would need to know what materials the samples were
1758,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment the additional information i would need to know is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers i would need to know how long i should rinse the samples with distilled water i would also need to know how this group determined the mass of each sampe in order to replicate the experiment
1759,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to knowhow much vinegar was used to see if that played a major factor on the difference in mass also you need to know how much distilled water is used to rinse off each sample because the water may wear away the sample even more lastly youoneed to know what youre measuring the mass with
1760,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment the additional information you would need is what the samples were how much vinegar was put into the containers and also the temperature of what they are going to put the containers because whether vinegar may us more acidic
1761,1,2,after reading this procedure i have figured out that you would need to know the type of the containers used weather or not they wer test tubes beakers etc also you would need to know how much of each sample you would need in oz kg g etc finally you would need to know how much vinegar to use in l ml etc
1762,1,0,additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the data table that was recorded starting the into on each sample information such as the samples starting to ending mass and difference is very important to understand because it is needed to understand the results of the experiment
1763,1,2,first i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers second i would need to know what the size of each sample needs to be then i have to know how much acidity is in the water
1764,1,1,you would not need any other information to replicate the experiment they tell you how long to put the samples in the vinegar how to rinse them how big to let them sit but one thing is how much vinegar did they use in each container
1765,1,1,the additional information that i would add is how much vinegar in each container i would also add a purpose of the experiment after massing the samples on step 6 determine the sample difference in before and after weight
1766,1,1,after reading the groups procedure some information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to measure out how much liquid vinegar they used for each sample and then measure it again after they take the centiment are to measure it
1767,1,2,well after reading the groups procedure i relized that the additional information they need to give you is how much vinegar to pour into the four separate but identical containers the group does not show that the samples sat for 24 hours then they removed the samples and rinsed each sample with distilled water also how do i know like where i am supposed to dry them in a windowsill in the cup in a microwave or just to let it sit there till it drys
1768,1,0,the three most important pieces of info that would need to replicate this experiment is to determine the mass of the diifferent samples pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers and after 24 hours resume the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water
1769,1,2,to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was used what sae was the container that held the vinegar and what temperature the containers where kept at durring the 24hrs
1770,1,3,additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment are what are the 4 different samples that i would be testing what size container would i need and how much vinegar do i use
1771,1,2,in step one the procedure needs to explain what four materials are being tested it is not specific enough by just saying four different sample in step 2 the procedure should state how much vinegar needs to be added to each container the reader has no way of knowing this information p the procedure says that the containers should each be labeled but it does not explain how they should be labeled or what they should say in order to be able to replicate this experiment that must be clarified
1772,1,3,some of the things that you would need inables to repeat this experiment is tell you what samples they are using all they say is get the mass of four different samples don't state what they are also how much vinegar is being added to the containers they did not say what amount of vinegar they put in the last thing is that
1773,1,3,to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the samples mentioned in step 1 are this way there would be no confusion as to what materials you are working with also you would need to know what kind of containers the samples are kept in lastly in order to properly replicate the experiment we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container
1774,1,0,i would need to know how the samples look in the procedure i feel like this because i already knoxw starting ending and difference in all mass to do the difference i would have to kneew how it was doing threw the procedures
1775,1,2,after reading this groups procedure i decided that it would need more information in order for me to accurately replicate in one thing i thought it would need be a given amount of vinegar to be put in each cue like 63 ml for example i also thought that the names of the samples marble limestone wood and plastic should be given for without them i would not know i was testing lastly i would include a final step thus told the sender to determine the difference between the starting and inding mass so that the reader knows where to go next
1776,1,2,one would need to know how much vinegar went into each container one would also need to know how the samples were and their masses
1777,1,1,first the group should tell how much of the vinegar to use also they should say how much vinegars the experiment needs to be done finally they should tell you what in the materials being weighted on
1778,1,3,there are three pieces of information you might need to replicate this experiment the first is how much vinegar to use in each container a second would be the type of conditions the container was placed in over night because things like light might cause a faster or more effective reaction on the samples third you would need to know in what form the samples are the marble or limestone could be in small rock form as oppose to all solid blocks which may cause the reaction to have a different outcome
1779,1,1,this group should for scientific verification repeat i the experiment at least twice they should also specify the amount of vinegar in each container the group should have had a control to contrast their findings
1780,1,1,you would need to know how much vinegar you would put in each container and also you'd have to make sure that you put equal amounts into each container or else you would find an number of errors in the experiment
1781,1,2,i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers also i would need to know how much distilled water i would need to rinse each sample and for how long
1782,1,0,determine the mass of four different samples place a sample of one material into one container and label repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container determine the mass of each sample allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes
1783,1,2,in order to repeat this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each of the four samples this would be essential for us to repeat the experiment step by step it would also be helpful to determine how much of each sample to put in each container and finally in order to repeat this experiment we would also have to do another trial and probably include a control variable to repeat this experiment exactly like the group of students
1784,1,3,to replicate the experiment by just reading the procedure i would need to know how much vinegar was poured onto the samples and affects the mass also what type size the container was because that would affect the concentration of the vinegar and also what material the sample were at the type of environment temperature brightness they were left in for the 24 hour period because that would also affect the end result
1785,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment additional information should be added for example the procedure should explain what type of samples to use include the number of tools that are needed and how much of an object or sample you need after adding these procedures a person would be able to repeat this experiment
1786,1,1,some information needed to replicate this procedure would be the temperature that this experiment another piece of information would be a graph and lastly would be a better explanation
1787,1,1,you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each of four separate containers did you remove the samples from the containers and rinse the samples with distilled water also how long did you let the samples sit and dry
1788,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment what will be needed is the depended independent and the control which are vinegar the container and the timing to each sample
1789,1,3,to replicate this procedure information such as how much vinegar to pour into the containers as instructed in step 2 what materials were used in step 3 or how much of the material was used also in 3 would be crucial
1790,1,1,what temperature environment should the containers be placed it cold hot room temp p after 24 hours do you need gloves and or goggles to work with this samples p where could 2 find marbles and limestone
1791,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i need to know specifically what samples they are talking about what type of control to use in this experiment and how much vinegar to pour in each container i would also be useful to know if when storing the sample for 24 hours if they should be in a certain temperature room temp high temp or low temp etc
1792,1,2,the students should have included how they determined the mass of the four samples in steps 1 or 6 they also needed to include how much vinegar they poured in the containers as well as how much water they used to rinse the samples or how long they rinsed them
1793,1,0,a group os student idid a science project called acid pain had to determine four different samples the put the four different samples which is marble limestone wood and plastic in four different cups filler with vinegar and afther 24 hours rinse the examples and dry them for 30 minutes and see what is the mass afther every sample loss mass expect for wood i had the same mass afther it was measured
1794,1,1,i think the group should mention how much vinegar they are using for measurements and they should include to record data procedure should be writen more clearly it would be hard to do this lab looking at this procedure they gave us
1795,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment one would need much more information firstly step 2 says to pour vinegar into four containers in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each i would also need to know how much of the four different samples marble limestone wood and plastic to use also in step 5 it says to let the samples sit and dry for 30 mins i would need to know if i should let them dry at room temp in a cold location in a sunny spot etc
1796,1,1,after reading the groups procedure some peices of information you would need to replicate the expieriment is the samples like marble limestone and wood
1797,1,0,i think you will need a bottle of vinegar a container cabels temer paper a manole a cemenstone wood and a plastic you will need
1798,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know how much vinger to pour into the samples you will also need to know what are the four samples you will also need to know constents controls the procedure needs to be made clear
1799,1,1,you would need to know the containers size and what you measure the samples with
1800,1,0,step one pour a vinegar in four identical containers p step two place a meterial in each container and label it p step three after 24 hours remove the material and rinse it out with water p step four allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes and determine the mass
1801,1,1,in the procedure they did not tell the sample's that they was doing to be testing also didn't tell us what mass was when they started and when they was finish what was the mass last they didn't tell us that they need to find the difference in mass
1802,1,1,in order to correct the errors in this experiment some few things need to be changed firstly the procedure never mentions recording your data this needs to be part of the procedure secondly the procedure states determine the mass it is not explained how to do so and what to use thirdly the procedure never tells what samples are or what to label them as in the experiment this is extremely important because the people doing the experiment need to know what they are working with
1803,1,2,their are three things that i would need to know to repeat the procedure the first thing is in their procedure they do not mention the four samples another thing is the procedure does not state the ph of the vinegar also they do not repeat the process for greater validity another thing is it serves ways to setup the content in the procedure
1804,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know first what were the samples when they just said sample if i don't know thetype of thesample then how was i supposed to test for anything i also would need to know what type of containers they were talleg about wer they using for small graduated cylinder or were or were they using a 50 gallon unit finally i would need to know they amounts i need the amounts of the samples the vinegar and the distilled water
1805,1,1,additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is what materials i would need for this experiment the amount i'm support to pour in the containers and what are the samples
1806,1,1,how much vinegar they are pouring in to each sample
1807,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i would need the following information first i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container second i would need to find out the exact size of of four identical containers finally i would need to know the temperature at which the four materials sat for 24 hours because the temperatures of the solution room could affect the results
1808,1,2,i would need toknow how much vinegar to put in each container how to weigh the mass of the doyeds how big of the object do i need
1809,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment i'll need more information if i wanted to find the change in mass of the four samples i would've had each sample weigh the same at the begining of the experiment also to make this lab more correct all of the samples should have the same amount of vinegar in them lastly in order to make the lab more correct i would put the exact steps in the procedure instead of saying repeat it'd be better and easier if it said exactly what to do
1810,1,0,in order to repeat his group's procedure you must have the same amour of mass of each cup place the same material into the same one it had the mass amount then procead with the same thing that you did with the last one sit for 24 hours then rince with distiled water
1811,1,1,to replicate the expeirment you would need to know the purpose knowing the purpose of the expeirment allows the person to know what to look for or to expect you would also need to know what type of containers to do the expeirment in so the experiment doesn't go wrong you would need to know where to remove the samples into after taken out of their containers you would also need to know what to do with the containers afterwards
1812,1,0,in order to replicate this experiment you need to explain why the samples loss mass what cause it to loss its host or why did it stay the same yo also need to tell us what you saw show us what happened when the samples were lossing its mass maybe you need to try chemicals on the samples beside vinegar
1813,1,3,the group would need to state how much vinegar was in each container they would need to state how long to rinse each container with distilled water they would need to identify what the four samples are in the procedure and to say to record the data
1814,1,3,you would need to know how much venegar to put in a so the strength of vinegar if there is a difference where should the container so far the of have i e in a every regardless room temperature
1815,1,0,you would need p 1 conclusion about how you did everything p 2 results of how everything came out as you wanted p 3 information about the procedures
1816,1,0,i think that you should start each sample with the same amount of mass so that your result will be more accurate also instead of writing the differences they should have recorded the final results to make it less confusing
1817,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how to determine the mass just stating 'determine the mass' does not tell me how to i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to the containers to make the data accurate and constant i would need to know where to dry the samples would they need to be in the sun shade etc
1818,1,2,in order to replicate the expirement we would need amount of vinegar used size of container used and how much distilled water was used for rinsing
1819,1,1,additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be a more specific description of mass and how much mass you are using what kind of containers need to be used and what size
1820,1,0,they should have done more tests they also should have wrote what the experament was about
1821,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar that is to be poured into each container you would also need to know the amount of distilled water the container are to be rinsed with and what qualities a sample to be the most efficient
1822,1,2,i would need to know what sample was put in each container also how much vinegar was poured into each container
1823,1,3,you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container as well as the size and shape of each container you would also want to know the type of vinegar used all three of the factors are important to insure consistency and increase validity
1824,1,1,to be able to replicate this problem you would have to know how much vinegar is going into each container also why they are performing the experiment what the problem is what are the different samples
1825,1,1,there are several pieces of information missing from this procedure first it is important to know in the procedure that the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic this information is not given until the data table also the procedure does not specify how much vinegar should be poured into the containers finnally it is necessary to know how much of each sample material should be added to the containers with vinegar with this information replicating the experiment would be much easier
1826,1,0,the additional information is how are we suppose to measure the mass of the object they need a indenpent varible and i need to then the control
1827,1,3,the additional information needed is p name the specific samples used in the procedure p say how much vinegar one needs to pour into containers p should the samples sit in light dark areas or covered
1828,1,2,some information that you would need is the amount of vinegar you should pour into theseperate containers second of all we should also know how long we rinse the samples for finally we need the previous results to compare data
1829,1,2,additional information needs to be added to this procedure they need to put gather materials for step one they need to tell exactly what samples rocks they need to add the amount of vinigar they are going to pour in they need to make the last sentence in step three a separate step this procedure was not carefully organized
1830,1,2,what the group forgot to do was tell the amount of vinegar to pour in each container the group also forgot to include whether or not if they need to cover each container they forgot to tell what metric unit to measure the materials with which was grams
1831,1,3,in order to replicate this acid rain experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use since it should remain a constant also how big each sample is results will not be accurate if the samples are not similar in size also all samples should be kept at the same temperature in the same area so they are not affected differently
1832,1,3,the group could have told how much vinegar the acual size of the container they used and the size if all the samples for example how lange was the piece of wood would size make a difference in the ending mass and the calculation of the difference in mass
1833,1,0,in this table it's says that first when starting mass that time marble was 9 8 then it's decrease it would 9 4 so it's decrease 0 4 in limestone the mass is decreas too first starting mass is 10 4 and then ending mass is 9 1 it's difference beetween 1 3 in wood no change in starting mass it was 11 2 and ending mass it would 11 2 too so it's in no change in plastic starting mass is 7 2 and ending mass is 7 1 it is decreases it's in difference beetween 0 1 i think wood is not heavy then other that's why it's in no change then limestone it's in big change to other because it's heavy them other
1834,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment one would need to know what was in each of the four samples also one must know how much vinegar to pour into each sample you would also have to know which sample of material was placed in which container
1835,1,1,you would need to include what the samples are of you would need to include where to record data finally you would also need to know if the mass of each sample should be the same without those bits of information it would be difficult to replicate the experiment
1836,1,3,in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need to see a few more pieces of information in their procedure firstly i would need to know what types of samples to use i can see what samples the group used by looking at their data table but i would want to know if i had to use the same ones also i would have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container because my results could change if i use a different amount of vinegar than the group did depending on the amount of vinegar i use the third thing i would need to know is how big the samples should be if it is important for the vinegar to cover the sample the procedure should tell me that so i don't make the sample too big
1837,1,1,to replicate the experiment additional information would include new loco 10 wait before trying the experiment again it should are state how much of the samples are bein put into the container and how long the samples should be rinsed for
1838,1,1,additional information that would need are to list what are the different samples being used
1839,1,3,in order to replicate this procedure i would need to know what the materials were the size of the material and how much vinegar was in each container
1840,1,0,this isn't a clear statement use to this expirement the problem would explain why the students were conducting this expirement in the first place
1841,1,1,the additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be knowing what the solutions are such as marble limestone wood and plastic you need to be more specific so the reader can completely do the experiment by themselves without asking questions
1842,1,2,to replicate the experiment i would need to know what safety precautions i should be taking the exart amount of vinegar to pour into each container and where the samples should be kept during the 24 hours they are in the container
1843,1,2,the person conducting the experiment would have to know what the samples were the procedure didn't include that knowledge another piece of information that would be needed to repeat the experiment would be how much vinegar is used for each sample and is the amount kept constant the last piece of information that is needed is what safety equipment should be used safety procedures are often included in the experiment's procedure
1844,1,3,there is some additional information needed to replicate the this experiment for example the procedure does not say how much vinegar to use it also just says samples and doesn't specify what the samples are of the procedure also does not tell us what type of containers to use or say to record your data
1845,1,2,if i were to rewrite the procedure i would incude what the samples were also i would include how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers
1846,1,2,in order to replicate the group's experiment one must know the amount of vinegar used on each of the samples also what type and the amount of sample is needed in addition knowing the purpose of the lab would be highly benefitial so that one knows what to test for it's imperitive to add the amount of samples and the amount of vinegar inorder to perform the experiment in all exactness otherwise one might receive not only different but in accurate data
1847,1,1,the students need to be more specific they need to state how much vinegar to pour into each of the 4 cups second they never said what unit or never said when to record the data lastly they needed to state how much distilled water
1848,1,2,you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the cups you would also need to know how long to rise the sample with distilled water
1849,1,1,additional information that would be needed is the initial amount of vinegar then the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours and then the difference in the volume if i had those three pieces of info i would be able to replicate the experiment and possibly compare answers
1850,1,3,additional information needed to replicate
1851,1,1,to follow this groups procedure i would have to be more detailed like instead of saying samples all the way through the procedure it would have been better if they the four things that they were testing in it would be less confusion in step two it would have been much better they just made it less complicated and sad place the marble limestone wood and plants samples into their own seperate identical containers and label them it would have been good to explain why they were told to find the mass of their samples
1852,1,1,the information you would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the four different samples the starting ending and difference in mass you would need the four samples marble limestone wood plastic because that's what the experiment is on you would need the starting mass ending mass and the difference in mass because that's how your doing the experiment
1853,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would also want to test all these four samples in water as a control in the same exact procedure furthermore it is also important to retest this experiment under a constant like room temperature to make sure it is not a variable in the results lastly to replicate this experiment you would need to know the chemicals in acid rain and chemical composition of vinegar to see if they corrolate and that this experiment is a good representation of what happens wi acid rain
1854,1,2,after reading the groups procedure i would need to know what samples were used if i did not use the same samples my experiment could come out differently i would also need to know what unit to weigh the mass in if i weighed it differently we could get different results i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container that could affect the outcome of my experiment
1855,1,3,to replicate the experiment one would need to know what the ''samples'' were without this information it would be impossible to do the experiment one would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to each container this could effect the outcome of the experiment in addition one would need to know the temperature of the vinegar which could also effect the outcome of the experiment
1856,1,0,additional information that you might need in order to replicate the experiment is to conduct a hypothesis you will need to get organized and gather all information to be able to perform a conclusion in the end with the information
1857,1,3,1 i would need to know which type of materials to use for the samples p 2 i would need to know how much vineagar to put in each containar p 3 i would need to know the approximate size of the samples
1858,1,2,one additional information needed would be how to determine the mass of each sample how much vinegar would be put in to each of the containers how big would the containers need to be
1859,1,3,you would need to say what different sample you had in the experiment where would you put them over night how big would the containers be for the samples
1860,1,3,additional data that i would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that was added into the container because if one sample measured more or less than another the data may also bear altered i would also need to know the size or the container used and what type of units they were measured with lastly to be able to replicate this experiment one would also need to know the temperature for every it's materials such as dabbing and wiping a papas towel or just simply allowing them to sit and dry on a substance
1861,1,1,there is not enough information to be able to replicate the experiment firstly they should state the samples you need to use in step one there should also be a control for you to compare it to the final error is that step 4 is too vague it says to remove the samples but not how to for example with tongs or wearing plastic gloves
1862,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know the size of each of the samples also i would need to know the amount of vinegar being used last i would need to know the size of the containers being used and how long to rinse the samples of rock for
1863,1,0,do the experiment again but with a different solution p let the samples sit for 48 hours p instead of sit and dry dry the sample with a paper towel or cloth
1864,1,2,the group did not include the temperature that they left the remaining samples they also did not include the amount of vinegar that we should pour in the four separate containers also they should of do the experiment more than once to make sure the answers they come out with were alright
1865,1,1,the group's procedure needs to be more specific they need amounts in the procedure they do not tell you how much vinegar is to be poured also what is needed to determine the mass of the samples also the samples how much of the sample we need
1866,1,1,to replicate this experiment i would need to know the control of the experiment what amount of vinegar is poured on sample what is being tested including independent and dependent variade
1867,1,1,in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i need to pour into each container if i would need to stable the mass of the samples with the vinegar still on it and also ruck at why am even performing this experiment
1868,1,1,the lab needs to include what samples are being added to the vinegar next time the lab should say that you should place a sample of marble limestone wood and plastic to each vinegar sample
1869,1,1,to repeat this experiment they would need a balence to measure the mass of each building material you would also need a graduated cylinder to measure out the vinger out in the experiment it does say the amount of vinger used
1870,1,3,additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment woold be what types of containers what type of materials and lastly how much vinegar should be poured in to each container because it doesn't state these items in their proceduer
1871,1,0,you would also need to
1872,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they put in the containers you would also have to know how to dry the samples then you would have to know how to dry the samples
1873,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment in the procedure it should say to write down or mark a chart saying the starting mass and ending mass and start the experiment you need to write down this information because it helps to find out the mass of the different samples
1874,1,3,in order to replicate the procedure i would need to know what volume of vinegar to use i would also need to know what sized containers or beaker to use the procedure should also explain what equipment to use when removing the samples from the container such as tongs lastly within the procedure it should state what samples will be used
1875,1,3,the procedure should look like this 1 determine the mass of 4 different samples marble limestone water and plastic 2 pour 10ml how much of vinegar in each 4 separate but identical containers 3 place a sample of one material into one container label repeat w remaining samples placing a single sample into a single contem after 24 hours remov the samples from the containers rinse with distilled water for 3 minutes 5 allow the samples to sit dry for 30 minutes at room temperature 6 determine the mass of each sample by subtracting the start mass in grams from ending mass in grams
1876,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into each cup so each sample would be sitting in the same amount of vinegar i would need to know how long to rinse the sample for so they are rinsed an equal amount of time also i need to know if each sample is supposed to way the same or be the same size
1877,1,2,in the procedure it didn't tell what the sample's were step 2 said to pour vinegar in four indentical containers but it didn't tell how much to pour 1 we don't measure them we are going to do the experiment wrong step 1 could of said record the starting mass of each of the four samples marble limestone wood and plastic
1878,1,1,after reading the group's procedure i believe that i would need the following information in order to replicate the experiment i would need the different types of materials listed in the procedure
1879,1,2,to do the experiment you would have to know the starting masses how much vinegar must be added to each container and what the sample materials are
1880,1,3,in order to replicate the group's procedure you would need to know p how much vinegar should be pour each cup p what type of container should be used p if the container should be left in the light or dark overnight or it avoid be covered
1881,1,0,the pour into the take the vinegar in each containers p who is the problem hypothesis p how you can do this experiment p a table who explain the experiment p use more types of masses like glass paper etc
1882,1,3,one other thing you would need to know is the amount of vinegar placed in each container so all samples have the same amount another thing needed to be known is where are the containers should be placed for 24 hours because the amount of sunlight might effect the experiment other than than this experiment is replicable
1883,1,2,additional information is to include the sample names to label them how much vinegar to use in the containers so the outcome is fair for all samples and also point out which is the independent variable and when is the dependent variable and which is the dependent variable to understand the lab better
1884,1,1,you would need to tell how much vinegar was add to each sample atthe start
1885,1,2,the procedure needs a control for each sample material this would be done by placing each sample into 4 more containers with no vinegar to use the procedure needs to say the amount of vinegar to put into each container the procedure should also say specifically what four samples to use
1886,1,2,the group should have provided a control so that i could compare my results in it they also should have been more clear about exactly how much vinegar i should put into each container each container should have the same amount but they didn't state what that was the group should have also been more specific about the size of the samples being experimented on i'm not sure if they all are the same or different
1887,1,2,it would be best of they specify what they are sampling in 1 in the procedure it should say determine the mass of four different samples of material in step number 2 it says pour in vinegar but not how much they should lied is at something like 150 ml for the graph it would be better if there was a column where it listed the percentages post so that the reader can understand which material was effected the mass
1888,1,1,after reading the groups procedure one would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container
1889,1,1,amount of vinegar would be needed p purpose of the experiment would be needed p hypothesis would be needed
1890,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment we need to know how much of the vinegar to poor in each container we would also need to know units of measurement we are using to determine the mass and what the samples are
1891,1,1,you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container you would need to get an average for the results lastly you would need to have samples with the same mass at the start
1892,1,2,some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment are the names of the different types of material so i knew i am testing the amount of vinegar poured into each container needed to be stated on the results will come out accurate another part of information that should have been included was a control of just water for each sample so there is something to compare the other results to
1893,1,0,we would need to have a contini also an independent variable and a dependent variable
1894,1,2,in order for me to repeat the expiriment i would need to know a little bit more information such as how much of each substance to use how much vinegar to use and what the temperature should be when letting the samples out in containers this person has to be a lot more specific in his procedure very hard to follow
1895,1,3,they would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup what sample material would be determine the temp that the samples should dry at
1896,1,1,the additional information you would and to replicate this experiment is you would need a lot of materials you would need to see the student observations and you would need to see the conclusion bassicaly a written lab report would be the best tool in recreating this experiments
1897,1,2,in order for me to replicate this experiment i need to know how much vinegar do i need to pour in the containers i need to know what the sample of the minerals are and i also need to know how i'm going to measure the mass
1898,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment you will need to record the mass 8 of different samples you also need to pour the vinegar into the separate containers you use hea to wait 24 hours are you have to let the sample dry for a while then you determine the mass
1899,1,1,some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would alst be to have the same amount of vinegar in each of the sample cups to have an equal effect 2nd would be to have the same amount of the sample get the same starting mass for all 4 so in the end you can use which sample was effected the most finally you should subtract the starting mass from the end mass to get the difference to see which was affected most by the substance
1900,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers you would also need to know what temperature the room they are left in should be overnight and how much distilled water to use when rinsing the samples
1901,1,1,how much vinigar is in each container what type of wood what is the control
1902,1,1,additional information needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers another piece of information that is missing is how much is a sample of each material finally you would repeat the experiment a couple of times to see if your results change
1903,1,1,i wan need to know what samples to use co i need a graph of some sat to record the starting and ending mass what unit of mass do the samples need to be weighed in
1904,1,1,to do replication of the experiment you would need measure how much vinegar are dropping the other stones have already been used and cannot be used again you also need to have a triple beam balance to be able to see how much each stone eventually weighed finally you would need to test them what they need to each sample for a separate 30 minutes unless they all get different in at the same time
1905,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment i need wood plastic limestone marble and vinegar also i would need water to rinse the samples off with after the 24 hour soak
1906,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to what the sample are that are using i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four samples i would also need to know what i must use to take out the sample would i use my hands or tongs
1907,1,2,if i were to replicate this i would need to know how much vinegar they put in each cup do you put different amount in different cups also where should i put the cups to rest inside outside would that have differen out comes
1908,1,3,this procedure lacks important details and is not in order step one is too similar to step 6 need to specify what kind of different samples and how to determine the beginning mass step two needs to include the specific amount of vinegar for each container the procedure should include the size needed for the samples to get accurate results step 3 should state what to label the containers with which information in step 6 they should include how to calculate the mass for example subtract beginning mass from end mass add record data results
1909,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was put into the container and what type of coma were used to hold the samples i would also need to know what the purpose of this experiment is in other words what is the group of studen is trying to prove
1910,1,2,1 how much vinegar do you put into the different containers 2 how large is the sample being used p 3 the dependent or the dependant
1911,1,2,one piece of information that should be included is the amount of vinegar necessary in each cup also how the material's mass is determined should be included lastly how big the material is should be stated
1912,1,1,in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need the temperature of the vinegar the amount of vinegar poured into each container and the amount of samples needed how much needed
1913,1,0,some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is steps 1 6 because there importan to make the table acecit you woud also need to make other table to show you resits and other infomation
1914,1,1,the group needs to provide how much vinegar is being poured into the containers the amount of vinegar can change the exeperiment
1915,1,3,how much vinegar how big should the containers be and how big should the samples be are all additional information you would need to recreate this experiment
1916,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment the person may need a diagram of the experiment the person needs the promble or statement to determine what they maybe testing for also they need the list of materials they have to use in order to do the experiment
1917,1,0,you will need to explain what is happening with the vinegar what happen to the sample after it drys and what the experiment looks like
1918,1,1,they need to say how much vinegar to put in each container the also need to say where to put the label on the material itself on the cup or on the table in front of the cup laslty they need to say how to remove the materials from the containers do they use their fingers or tongs
1919,1,1,to replicate the experiment the group would need to better state the problem give an amount of vinegar to put in the containers and lastly use more then one trial
1920,1,1,information that would be needed in the procedure would be the name of the sample material also you'll need when and how to measure the mass of materials this information is needed to replicate the experiment
1921,1,1,how much vinegar what kind of scale
1922,1,1,to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour on the rocks the purpose of this experiment and a control variable
1923,1,0,three pieces of information i would need to replicate the experiment are vinegar to pour into the containers a scale to weight the mass and find thedifference at the end of the experiment and distilled water to rinse each sample with
1924,1,1,in this procedure they leave out some thing that makes it im possible to recreate quantitys' it says nothing about how much vinegar or rock sam plquantity also using cleaner numbers would make iteasyer to recreate and read
1925,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you need to have information some example of things you would need to no is how much vinegar is being poured in each of the seperate containers another thing that you would need to no is the volume of each substance because the surface area will effect how much is eroded off another thing where you let the samples sit for 30 minutes because there might be difference in temperature effecting how much it drys
1926,1,3,the additional information that needed to be included are what the samples are the amount of vinegar poured into the containers in step 2 also need to be known another part that needs more information is how much of each sample needs to be placed in the container in step 3 another part of this experiment that needs more information is step 2 what type of container should the samples be placed into
1927,1,3,one piece of information i would need is what are the four different samples another piece of information is how much vinegar i need to pour into each container the third piece of information i would need is how much and how long should i rinse each sample with distilled water another piece of information you could use is at what temperature conditions are the samples left to sit and dry in
1928,1,3,in order to replicate this group's experiment you will need top know how much vinegar is being used how long you rinse each sample and conditions the samples are drying in
1929,1,2,you would need to know what to take samples of the procedure isn't specific in what materials are being weighed you would also need to know any safety procedures to be taken while conducting this experiment also the procedure does not give a specific place to leave the containers additionally the procedure should tell the dimentions of the samples so that their volumes are all the same
1930,1,0,the additional information you would need to know is the shape size and liquid
1931,1,1,to secrefullu replicate the procedure i or anybody else would need the following information first a statement that will tell me what i am doing the lala for amaterials list will also be needed last i would need a better procedure that is
1932,1,3,in order to better replicate this expiriment the students must also tell us the amount ofvinegar poured into each cup m s the amount of water used to rinse the materials in m s and the time given to rinsing how long may each container rinsed in water
1933,1,2,in the procedure number i doesn't explain what four different samples to use another thing the procedure could have said was to list what materials to use after reading this procedure i would be able to replicate this experiment not knowing how much vinegar to pour in might mass up this experiment
1934,1,2,some additional information thut hey coold put in the data is how much vinegar they pot in the container and another thing that they could say is about the temperature of the room or the vinegar
1935,1,0,the three additional information that can be added is the control of the experiment the students could've done these with a warm temperature and one with cold lastly they could have used regular water than distilled water
1936,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would need the names of the samples you must use the measurements for the vinegar and the measurements amounts for each sample
1937,1,2,some additional information the group could add is how much vinegar your supposed to put in each container in addition this group could also include the size of the container they're using finally i think they should have been a little more specific with their steps
1938,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment additional information you would need is what do you use to measure the mass tell it in your procedure tell the reader how much vinegar to put in each of the containers in step 2 also tell the reader where do you place the containers after they have been rinsed' do you place them in a cold area hot area or room temperature this could mess up the experiment if you are not told this
1939,1,2,identify what are the four rocks they are going to use and if its all different shapes also tell if the contaners are the same size or not
1940,1,1,i think that they need to show how many cups they have the amount of vinegar and how much of the materials that they are using for there experiment
1941,1,3,the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment i would need to know what the four different samples so i can test the same thing the seconds to saw vinegar to pour into the containers all the samples have the same quality level you say this is to say now long tonne earn sample so the vinegar can wash off
1942,1,3,there is a lot of additional information one would need to repeat this experiment first the students should include the different names for the four samples in order for proper replication furthermore the students should include the amount of vinegar that should be poured into the containers the size of the sample should also be indicated in the procedure furthermore it would be best if the size of the container was provided in the procedure
1943,1,0,acid rain p will repeat some samples make data and check if the experiment is correct
1944,1,2,in the procedure it is not included how they determined the mass of the samples or what the samples were step 3 also it is not stated in step 6 how to determine the mass the temperature of the distilled water is not defined at constant in step 4 the location or temperature of the place where the four substances in step 4 are not defined nor the temperature of where they are drying in step 5
1945,1,1,the additional information that i would need would be the materials so that we would know what we need to do the experiment we need a desk explanation as to why we are determinig the mass of each sample
1946,1,2,additional information that i would need inorder to conduct this experiment is what different kinds of samples how much vinegar to pour into each cup and also what to label the cups if i dont have any of this my experiment won't be valid i need to know the independent and dependent variable and whats has to be constant another thing is what are we using to weigh the samples with
1947,1,1,you would need to know what you are using what the samples are you would need to know what you are mixing the vinegar with such as if the cup is empty or if there is water or something in there and you would need to know when you start the experiment
1948,1,0,in group's acid rain procedure the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the mass they started of in how long after to remove the samples from the container and the time to allow the samples to sit and dry
1949,1,0,instead of vinegar they should put a different kind of liquid to test with also instead of leaving it for 24 hours leave it for 48 to see if there would be a certain change in mass also when samples are ready to sit and dry leave them there for 45 instead of 30 minutes
1950,1,1,the additional information needed is the amount of vinegar temperature of the vinegar
1951,1,0,i would say wood because the mass difference is 0 on the starting mass is 11 2 so is the end of the mass 11 2
1952,1,1,this group gave some of the information but not all because they didn't say how much viniger they put in the container and the only did 2 trail 3 trail is what it needed to be and the calculation cannot be accura because how they going to leave it in over min and then come back the next day and give oe say has the got their calculations for are not enough into
1953,1,1,1st you would need to know what is they were trying to figure not p 2nd you need to know what material they are going to use 3rd i would need to know what there conclusion is
1954,1,1,in order to replicate it would mean that you would be more detailed and tell if the object is a solid liquid or gas its state of form and if it can move or its unmovable and describe the item or what type of item it is
1955,1,0,1 you would need to measure the starting mass p 2 you would need to measure the ending mass p 3 you would need to measure the difference between the starting and ending mass
1956,1,1,the additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is you would need to know the name of the samples that you putting in the container you would also have to label the sample when you remove them from there containers
1957,1,1,the additional information i would need is how much vinegar i would have to put into each sample also in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much of a sample i needed in order to accuratey results the group also needs a problem question becouse another scientist might want to know why someone wants to do this experiment and what the other scientist was trying to determine or prove also i would need to know how many trials i would need to do
1958,1,3,one thing you could change is the amount of vinegar the sample size and were you dry it because of the temp
1959,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample was used how warm the vinegar is and how much vinegar to put
1960,1,2,additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed the size of the cups and also a control to see just how effective this experiment is
1961,1,1,to replicate the experiment in the procedure they need to be more suspific as to say what the four different samples are they should also be more suspific on how they measure the mass the third thing they should do is told which material they were using and then said reapet steps 3 6 so that it is clearer and easier to understand
1962,1,2,one piece of information would be how much vinegar to pour into the four containers another piece of information would be how much of the sample materials to place into the containers so all four containers don't have an advantage or disadvantage because of unequal amounts a last piece of info would be what temperature to keep the containers in
1963,1,2,you would need to know what samples you are using how to determine the mass of them and what containers you must use
1964,1,2,i would need to know
1965,1,1,an additional piece of information you would need to replicate the experiment is the temperature of the enviroment the samples are in because they already have the starting mass ending mass and the time period
1966,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar the group of students how poured into the containers secondly what kind of containers did the students use thirdly what expecting is in the sample itself
1967,1,1,in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need to know what to weigh the objects that i am testing with i also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and also the unit of measure that i am measuring the vinegar with
1968,1,2,after reading the groups procedure i think i need to know p 1 how much vinegar did they pour into each containers p 2 is every containers get same amount of vinegar p 3 is every samples sit and dry in same environment
1969,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what amount of each sample to use where to to dry the samples and how big the containers should be
1970,1,1,some additional information would be what samples are going into the cups also how much of each sample are in a cup and why are they doing this experiment
1971,1,0,this is not a clear statement of the experiments aclear statement of the problem would include an explation of why students were pavestigation and the fain
1972,1,0,the mass is ending 9 4 and of the wood is 11 2 in who the two are difference at the mass and at wood because have different peso
1973,1,3,in this procedure there are a esuple pieces of information that should be included they should tell you how much vinegar you use and if it is the same amount for each sample also it should tell you to record the data of starting mass they could tell you how long to rinse the sample and the names of the samples could be included in the procedure finally at the end of the procedure it should tell you to record your data and find the difference in the masses
1974,1,0,additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be to add more materials to the experiment adding different kinds of pack could influence other materials in the experiment another peice of information to be considered would be to increase the time the materials are soaked in the vinegar this would probably have an increased affect on the materials another peice of information would be to do more trials this would help with pinpointing the exact affect vinegar has on these materials
1975,1,1,the additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment are a balance scale how much space in containers and how much mass used
1976,1,0,i would add water because it would be less lighter than the rest of the stuff
1977,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container how to determine the mass of the samples and what type of vinegar is being used i would also need to know how to name and rinse each sample and how to dispose of the vinegar waste lastly for is important to know the texture and distribution of each sample a container for example if the limestone was crushed and poured in the vinegar container it would dissolve much faster
1978,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment u would have to try use many different samples another way they can do this is to be more pacific on the data by telling us how many cups of vinergen is needed
1979,1,2,additional information we would need is the type of samples in order to replicate the experiment knowing how much vinegar to add in four seperate identical containers would also need to know how to measure the samples masses all this helps to replicate the experiment
1980,1,2,to replicate a better experiment the first thing you would want to add is how much vinegar is poured in each container if one container has more than the other more will erode the material quicker giving inaccurate results another factor they may want to change to the same weight and size of the material once again isn't going to give you good results lastly they shouldn't use the already used material to replicate the experiment some materials are weaker than others and may erode quicker so those are all factors the group of students should add
1981,1,3,the first piece of information that is nesessary to repeat this experiment if only given the procedure is what the four samples are we would also need to know how much vinegar to place in each container we would also need to know if the containers needed to be opened or closed during the twenty four hour period
1982,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know opromatly the size of the sample used so that i would achieve similar results i would also need to know the amount of vinegar poured into each of the four containers i need to know this because different amounts of vinegar may cause more or less of a change in mass another thing that i would need to know is the environment that the samples are to sit in the temperature and lighting could effect my results lastly i would need to know if the containers are covered or left open if they are left open some of the vinegar could evaporte thus effecting my results
1983,1,0,they would need to explain how their experiment went so they used different objects and put them in containers with vinegar to soc determine the mass of each so this is how they should explain their experiment we've tested four objects in vinegar and the four objects were a marble limestone wood and plastic the mass of each were marble 4 8 limestone 10 4 wood 11 6 and plastic 7 2 when we put them in the vinegar and took them out and set them down for 30 minutes we saw that the mass of the marble went down to 9 4 limestone 9 1 wood 11 2 and plastic 7 1 so the mass of the marble went down 0 4 limestone 1 3 wood 0 0 and plastic 0 1
1984,1,3,what additional information we will need is how much vinegar they used what kind of vinegar they used and how big and what kind of containers they used they should also have a control group plus they should tell for how big each sample is
1985,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment the additional information that is needed is to record exactly how much vinegar needs to be poured into each container another piece of additional information that is needed is how to determine the initial mass of each sample it is also necessary to be specific and state exactly which material marble limestone wood or plastic should be placed into each container
1986,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container you would need to know what the four different samples were and you would need to know whether or not to cover or put a lid on the containers
1987,1,0,you need a grab for the chart
1988,1,2,the procedure did not say what types of cocks shuld be used in this experiment the procdure also does not state hou much vinegar buc in the cups at the end of the procedure it should say repeat experiment for better results
1989,1,1,they should have done more trials for each sample to make sure it is accurat also there should be the same amount of vinegar for each sample it should say put each sample in the same size contaner and cover the sample with vinegar or say how much vinegar to use
1990,1,3,firstly the students need to be clearer with their procedure the amount of vinegar to pour on the samples can dramatically alter the results so an exact amount is desireable how big are the containers the size matters when replicating another necessity in replication of this experiment is the time used to rinse the samples they all must be the same
1991,1,2,how much of a sample to put in the container also how much big were the containers and how much vinegar should be used
1992,1,1,should try different samples for each container p another suggestion let it sit and dry for different time p another make sure is the same temperature
1993,1,0,i think that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure tell what we were getting the mass of also they should have once more trials each why this observation was being done
1994,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would first need to know the amount of vinegar i needed to pour into the containers it would also be good to say what they are using to determine the mass of the i object whether it was a triple beam balance or an cetric balance finally in order to replicate the experiment they would need to tell me what the samore are because it all know is four different sample i'm not going to know they mean marble limestone wood and plastic
1995,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use what form each sample is in and the type of vinegar that was used for the experiment
1996,1,1,the additional information needed to replicate the experiment would first be how much vinegar to pour into the cups and the units in which to measure the rocks mass and vinegar they would also have to include the purpose of the experiment so others understand the experiment better
1997,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment more information could be needed the procedure would that base to
1998,1,3,to be able to replicate the folowing experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container i would also need to know what samples to use where do i put the containers for 24 hours
1999,1,2,the additional information needed is the amount of vinegar that goes in each cup also the need to list the material and they need to add the mass object w
2000,1,1,you would need to have a control to determine what you are doing the experiment for the students would also need to have a dependant variable as well as a dependant variable the students also need to state what they are testing in the experiment
2001,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what the four different samples were because they did not mention them in the procedure i would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container i would need to know how big the containers were
2002,1,1,the three different peices of information you would need is what samples are you using for the experiment the second thing you would need to measure the mass on a scale before measuring it after the 24 hours and the third reason is subtract the starting mass from the ending mass to get the difference between them
2003,1,2,some information i would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was used what to measure the mass of he samples with and how long should the sambes be rinsed with distilled water
2004,1,3,after reading the students procedure one thing i would add is the amount of vinegar to add to each sample another thing i would add in the procedure is the size of the container they want the samples in and if they should be covered the last thing i'd have the students add to their procedure is the actual samples themselves so that the person can know what substances they are testing if all those things were done the experiment would go a lot smoother and the results would be a lot more accurate
2005,1,2,the information needed to replicate this experiment is to identify the different samples and how to make them they would need to specify how much vinegar to pour into the containers also be more clear about the control in the experiment
2006,1,2,the additional information you could add are how much of the vinegar do we add to the containers or what kind of vinegar to add because they don't say this in the procedure also when to start they don't tell you when to start or to end they only said after 24 hours remove the samples they also don't tell you how or when to record the mass of the object they just say rinse containers and let them dry also they need to run two more test
2007,1,0,you would need to know the age of the samples because if the wood is old and dried out it'll absorb some of the vinegar
2008,1,2,additional information the students should include ares 1 what is the problem they are trying to solve 2 list of materials 3 amount of viniger
2009,1,2,on order to replicate the experiment
2010,1,2,after reading the group's procedure the additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment includes how much of each sample to use because without having the same amount of sample you don't know wether the mass difference is due to composition or amount the same applies to the vinegar without knowing how much vinegar to pour into the cups one might be affected more because it has more vinegar in it than the others this can also apply to the distilled water without knowing how long to rinse or how much water to use one sample might be affected more
2011,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know if there were any other factors while you left it sitting such as temperature sunlight also you need to know the independent and dependant variable
2012,1,3,to complete this experiment again the cares of the samples should have been stated at the beginning with at knowing knowing what the samples are how are you suppost to experiment on them there should be a list of all the things that you will need during this experiment and there should be more details like what kind of measurement are you measuring the mass or what kind of container is it or were do you store the experiment for those 24 hours
2013,1,3,a size of the containers types of containers p b amount of vinegar p c size of the samples
2014,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment correctly you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the separate containers you would also need to know what unit of measurement has to be used to measure the sample finally you would need to know what kind of containers were used and if they would effect the masses or the samples
2015,1,0,in this lab the information you would need in order to replicate the experiment again you should have a control another think is that how many samples to put in one container also you would need distilled water
2016,1,3,the three imost they had bett where how much vinegar did they use for the experiment also that they forgot to saw how big containers were and if they cover the container after they put the vinegar and materials
2017,1,3,in addition i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the four containers also the size of the containers and how much of the sample was put into each container
2018,1,0,some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be certain amount of vinegari would need to put into each cup exactly what materials i am to add in each of the four cups and also how to remove the samples from the containers
2019,1,1,the additional information you need would be the materials needed for the experiment the problem that you are experimenting dependent variable independent variable and even a graph to explain their results better
2020,1,0,they need the data to add of each experiment need hypothesys
2021,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what are the different samples that i am investigating i would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples the group needs to clarify that the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic and you measure the mass using a scale and in grams lastly i need to know how much vinegar to put in each container to replicate this experiment
2022,1,2,in orderd to replicate this experiment the additional information required includes the amount of vinegar poured into containers the location where the containers were started and the instrument used to prepare the mass of samples either a laple temprereture digital scales
2023,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container also how much water you place into each sample and you would need to record step 3 more clearly
2024,1,2,to replicate the experiment i would first off need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples for the next step would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the pieces of material i would want to know how exactly to rinse the seperate slabs at the end and then know how to measure the mass of the seperate samples at the end as well
2025,1,0,this procedure is not descriptive at all wedon't even know what to use for the first step it also doesn't say the exact amount of what everything should be the last mistake it states to label but we are not sure of the exact name so all of these mistakes would need to be fixed
2026,1,2,to replicate the experiment i would need to know what samples i am sopost to use how much vinegar i'm sopost to put in these samples and what i'm supost to look them
2027,1,0,you will need to write a hypothesis on the experiment and a conclusion on what happened and a graph on the changes that the experiment went through
2028,1,2,to replicate this experiment i would have to know what kind of container they used and the size of it also i would have to know where i should remove the samples to after 24 hours
2029,1,1,they should have wrote in the 4 different sample telling us what they are also they told us to determine the mass but they didn't tell us to fing the difference in mass from the starting mass to the end mass
2030,1,1,to replicate the experiment again i would need to know how much vinegar used i would need to have a control group like marbles limestone wood and plastic placed in a distilled water esp for 24 hours to test my results again and lastly i would need all the materials to weigh the same before starting the experiment
2031,1,1,you would need to know how much vinegar they used and what shape the samples were in i if they were all marble shaped the results would very from a jaged figure
2032,1,0,i would need them to explain to me how they got the conclusion mass of the 4 samples p then i would tell them to include procedure step by step throught the exsperiment p how much acid rain was need to effect the mass
2033,1,2,to replicate this experiment you will need to know the name of the material how much vinegar to actually pour in the containers what is the name of the sample material
2034,1,3,to replicate the experiment the group would need to state the amount of vinegar that is to be poured into the containers the group also needs to state if the containers should be covered and at what temperature the containers should be stored
2035,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what is the statement that they are trying prove also how much vinegar was added to each container finally each starting mass should be the same
2036,1,1,it would be very helpful if you knew what the mass was at the end of the expiriment it also should show exactly how much vinegar you should pour into each container in that case you can have an exact amount each time also it would help to know how much marble limestone wood and plastic we have in each container
2037,1,2,some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be what you would use to find the mass how much vineger to pour in the containers and where should the samples lit for 30 minutes in the heat in the reid
2038,1,3,to replicate the experiment more information is needed such as the amount of vinegar in each cup what the samples are how long the samples should be rinsed and clearer directions instead of saying pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers explain how much vinegar and whether cups should be large or small the experiment procedure needs to be more specific so that more trials can be done exactly the same or as close as possible for a more accurate conclusion
2039,1,0,some additional information that they would need to replicate the experiment is to add the starting mass with the ending mass then they get an answer and then they divide that answer with the answer in the distance in mass numbers
2040,1,2,the next time this group did this experiment they would get more accurate results by measuring and recording the amount of vinegar poured into each container they should also record the temperature of at which the containers are stored this information will improve the accuracy of the results and will make it easier to repeat the experiment
2041,1,1,to replicate the group's procedure the students will need to tell how much vinegar goes into the identical contaicee also they would need to tell how much distilled water would need to be added
2042,1,3,in this groups procedure you wuld need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in container and also what kind of container also they could add what temprature they left the material in the containers
2043,1,3,after reading the groups procedure in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know how much vinegar was needed how big was the sample pieces and did need to be close to sunlight or just room light
2044,1,1,to replicate this experiment well you would need to know more information the procedure did not tell you how much vinegar to put in each container the procedure also didn't explain that you should weigh the samples in grams before you begin an experiment that is replicated may not always be exact but the important information should be included
2045,1,3,in order to replicate the experiment additional information needed would be the volume of vinegar also the procedure should say if the containers are covered or uncovered finally it should specify what the samples should dry in like a petri dish to avoid contamination
2046,1,1,one thing that's need to be done to the procedure is get safety goggles because it's always important to be safe another thing that's needed to be put is gathering materials you need also the last thing to be done is when your finished with an experiment clean up your area
2047,1,1,some additional information i would like to add to this acid rain experiment is to tell what amount or how much vinegar to place in the containers another suggestion is to add more detail to the first step by agknowledging what samples we have to determine the mass or they might also want to include what or how to determine the mass of each of the samples
2048,1,3,additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be to know what the four different samples are that are being tested another piece of additional information needed is the amount of vinegar being poured in step 2 one other piece of additional info would be how long to rinse the samples in distilled water and what temperature the water should be at while rinsing
2049,1,0,a proceder that i would put in that after they all dryed then i out them on a balance beam scale and then add 4 different mass from starting mass
2050,1,1,additional info needed to replicate the experiment are say what sample types your using i tell you how to set up the cups and describe about the samples if the group did these things i would be able to copy this experiment
2051,1,0,this is a good procedure to follow only it lacks of some problems towards the end which cause the experiment to completly go wrong because of the fact that you will be unable to finish the investigation i myself would not change but rather much could a step or two by the procedure for example it is necessary to comprare all the answers with one another by subtracting and seeing each others differences and 8 depend exparament al least three times to see if it is valid
2052,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four seperate but identical containers i would also need to know what the four samples were even though it is stated in the data table it is not stated in the procedure where it should be stated another thing would be helpful to know is what types of container i should i put the samples in so that i can replicate the experiment the same way they performed it
2053,1,2,after reading the group's procedure the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is specify types of materials like what kind of wood or plastic did they use because there are different kinds i would also need to know how much vinegar to use for each material because that information was not given and using different amounts of vinegar can affect the results
2054,1,0,additional information you would need would be your independent variable dependent variable control and you would have to form a hypothesis the independent dont variable is what you control and the dependent variable depends on the i v
2055,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what materials were being used in the procedure the group wasn't clear on what substances they were using also the group needs to tell you to find the difference between the 2 mases they were not clear on that in the procedure
2056,1,2,you would need to know how much vinegar to put in what samples you would use and what the independent variables could be
2057,1,2,first they would need to list the four sample names so i know what i am working with second list down the mass of each sample finally list down either you put samples under heat cold where
2058,1,3,first are they didn't fell you to put on your safety gageles then they determine the mass of four different samples are of what to use to get the mass with the next step it doesn't say what kind of containers to use glass or metal or raind or savare i also don't know what to label do you put it on a paper tawel to dry also because it doesn't say how to
2059,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment you will need to know how many pieces of each sample are going to be added you would also need to know the conditions of the resting place because they can affect the experiment in addition it would also be useful to know how the amounts are being measured
2060,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment additional information i would need would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container to make sure there is only one independent variable the material the amount of vinegar in each cup must be the same also the temperature of the room should be identified because it have a possible effect on the outcome last the volume of each material needs to be specified should be identical
2061,1,1,in order to complete this experiment they need to inquire measurements of how much vinegar to put in the cups and how much of each sample should go into the cup also they forget to tell you to get a starting mass so you are capable of finding the difference between the starting and ending mass
2062,1,1,in the groups procedure they need to add additional information they need to add 1 gather materials then they should list the materials needed 2 list the 4 different samples also they should add 5 record data they should add these three things because you should write a procedure very detailed because some people might not understand
2063,1,2,i would need to know what kind of samples will i need i would also need to know how much vinegar should be poured into the containers most importantly i'm going to need to know what to use to figure out the mass
2064,1,1,you would need the names of everything and the numbers that go with it so that everyone understands what youre trying to explain to them
2065,1,0,to make the experiment able to be replicated there can be a different amount of time there can also be more containers which lastly there can be different placements such as one container can be in the sun another can be in the shade or simply there can be a temperature differences instead of measuring the mass all these factors can make this experiment reprodurable
2066,1,0,additional information i will need in order to replcate this experiment is how long you leave the vinegar in the four different samples how many times you have to do it for and how you measure the mass
2067,1,0,we need more starting mass ending mass difference in mass then test it all over
2068,1,0,it is a good statemen ot the problem cause is showing u every thing they did and every color temperatur after s minutes and every temp after 16 minutes
2069,1,0,i think in order to replicate the experiment you would have to change the data recorded for this experiment
2070,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know what the samples are of we would also need to know why we are massing these samples what are we trying to find thirdly we need to know where to put the containers the environment must affect the experiment in one way or the another
2071,1,0,i don't know
2072,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what materials to use also how much of each material for example step 2 indicates to pour vinegar in container how much vinegar should i pour another thing i would need to know how to determine things and it what units i should for example step 1 indicates to determine the mass of four different samples it also never specifies type of samples
2073,1,1,you need to know what the samples are p you need to put the starting mass of the samples and record the ending mass
2074,1,2,they would need to include how much vinegar they are pouring into each containers name the samples that they are going to use min their procedure and they should also say if they have any constants those are some ways in which their procedure would be well
2075,1,2,additional information needed would first be what the four different samples are also how much vinegar to pour into each containers in the procedure it says to place sample in a container since they haven't said what samples there are people wouldn't be able to replicate this experiment there's not enough information and that wouldn't give the most accurate results
2076,1,2,to begin with the procedure should state how much vinegar should be used in the cups also it should specify merisseds or materials in this cups
2077,1,1,what is the reasoning for doing this experiment what kind of container should we use what should we use to determine mass before and after
2078,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment it is necessary to know exactly how much vinegar was put into each container also what type of containers were used also what would need to be known is how much water was used to rinse it off
2079,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment some additional information i would need would be what the 4 different samples were i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in the cups lastly i would know how much of the sample i would be weighing whether it be 50z or 51bs the sample is not clear in the procedure
2080,1,0,to repeat this experiment you would need have valid data a control and more trials also i would put the four samples of vinegar in different environments such as a refrigarator or incubator to see if the data would be affected
2081,1,2,the students could include what the four samples actually were the students should also label the identical containers so they don't get mixed up the students should also include what device they're finding the mass of the samples with the students should also include how much vinegar should be poured into each container
2082,1,1,you will need the same amount of the experience because it is the main part of the experience and also measure haw much sample or vinegar you using and water check it out often times to see if anything will happen
2083,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used what temperature the room in which the samples were and how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample another factor you should know to replicate the experiment was if the corner used was dark or if sunlight touched the rocks during the experiment
2084,1,2,the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is 1 how much would all the samples weigh p 2 how much vinegar do i pour in the containers and 3 where would this experiment take place what kind of surroundings and environment
2085,1,0,in the experiment limestone has the most different in the mass wood didn't change at all the mass stayed the same wood had highest starting and ending mass to make this experiment better they could of had more trial
2086,1,1,you would need to include how much vinegar you need to put in the containers they also need to include the formula for determining the mass also they need to include how much material we need
2087,1,3,to replicate this experiment you would have to no the amount and mass of the vinegar you would also have to no the temperature of the vinegar and the temperature when the stones were drying another piece of information needed is the ph of the vinegar you would also have to no what type of wood used in order to replicate the experiment you would also have to no the type of plastic
2088,1,3,to replicate this experiment you would require a few more pieces of information for example how much vinegar to put in that piece of information is never mentioned in the procedure and it is very important to ensure validity another piece of information needed is a supply list it is never stated with what you are supposed to determine the mass and the only supplies mentioned are the 4 ''containers'' and an unidentified amount of vinegar also where the containers should be kept is never mentioned because if they are stored incorrectly it might cause the experiment to be invalid
2089,1,1,additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment is we would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container
2090,1,2,the students could have said how much vinegar they put into the containers they also could have said how big or small the containers were
2091,1,3,some additional info that i would need for this experiment is the temp that they would have the containers in also another piece of info i would need is how much vinegar i should put in and last info that i would need is should the room i leave them in be light dark or should it be moderate all this to make the experiment reenactment accurate
2092,1,2,the group of students should have mentioned in their procedures what four samples to use in the experiment otherwise the experiment wouldn't be able to be replicated because we don't know which sample to use also they should've mentioned the amount of vinegar that should've been poured in each of the four containers so we know how much to pour in they should also have mentioned whether or not we had to record the difference in the mass of the samples or not
2093,1,0,to replicate this experiment you would need to have a starting mass of marble limestone wood and plastic to do this you would also need to use the group's procedure
2094,1,2,to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the four different samples are you also need to know the starting mass for each sample how to determine the mass of each sample and where to keep the containers for the 24 hours
2095,1,1,in step number 5 you should specify where to let the samples is and dry make sure it is not too cold or too hot in step 2 you should include how much vinegar to pour into each container in step 1 and 6 you should describe how to find the mass of the samples
2096,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment there needs to be how much vinegar to use
2097,1,1,in the group procedure i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container how to determine the mass and what to label each container in order to replicate the experiment
2098,1,1,when the tell you to determin the mass of four different samples they should say starting mass in step two they should say how much vinegar to pour into all containers the should include determine the ending mass
2099,1,3,you would need to know what kind of samples to use how much vinegar is used and how to dry them
2100,1,2,after reading the groups procedure in order to replicate is one must add three things such as amount of vinegar poured into the containers need a scale and a type of vinegar
2101,1,1,i would neet to know the samples a discription of them in order to do the investigation in order to make it clear and understandable
2102,1,2,i would need to get a lsit of all the different materials i would also had to know how much vingar to use also one else ending results might not be as others i would also need to folow how much
2103,1,2,yow'd need to know how muchvinegar was poured into each sample you'd needto know how much of each sample you'd need how long should you rinse it
2104,1,1,the students have neglected to include the amount of vinegar and it is hard to replicate the lab without measurements the students should also include other trials and also if the vinegar needs to be replaced these are important to procure correct results
2105,1,0,you would need to find out what the mass is question 1 we would also need to know what the remaining samples are question 2 lastly we would want to answer question 6 and find out the mass
2106,1,1,to repeat this groops procedure you would need 3 additional pieces of information p 1 the amount of vinegar to put on the sample p 2 the amount of each sample that you need p 3 the amount of distilled water to rinse each sample
2107,1,3,reading the group's procedure it should have been more thorough for me to replicate that experiment they needed to included in their procedure the 4 types of samples that were experimenting on the amount of vinegar used in their experiment the types of containers that were used and the size of each container they also needed to include the name of the sample that should be poured into container and also which container also where were the containers left to dry the temperature of the atmosphere outside or inside for me to be able to replicate this experiment
2108,1,1,you would need to know how much vinegar you are pouring into the containers another thing you would need to know is how much of a sample you put into the labled container finally at the end you should use the same amount of distilled water to rinse off the vinegar at the end
2109,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment the group would need to specify in number one the four different samples in step 3 they need to specify which sample goes into which container and lastly they should add another step which should state that they should run atleast 3 trials so that their information could be accurate
2110,1,0,the additional information that i need in order to replicate the experiment is 1 i have to get all the ingredient for the experiment 2 later i have to put all the ingredients to ge ther and i have to show how to prepare the experiments then ii all the ingredient and i have to know how to prepare the experiment and later i have to give the time necesary and for the end i have to check was what the result
2111,1,1,first you have to determine the samples name predict the mass so when the right answer comes up you dont get shocked at the end of the procedure compare them to your prediction
2112,1,0,in order to replicate the experiment they would need to determine the mass of the four different samples 2 times of four vinegar in each of four seperate but identical container 2 times next place a sample of one material into one container 2 times then repeat with the remaining samples and place a single sample into a single container after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min then determine the mass of each sample
2113,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the four containers the amount of vinegar would affect the difference of mass and time also i would need to know what kinds of containers it use for placing the samples in some containers might not allow enough room for the samples lastly i would need to know how much distilled water i would need to rinse the substances with this could change the difference in mass
2114,1,2,to improve the groups experiments they would need to add to the procedure how they found the difference in masses also the group should include clearly when the started recording and when they stoped recording finally to improve these students labs i think the should expain the list of materials they were using and its size
2115,1,2,one thing we would need to know in the procedure is how much vinegar to pour in the containers if we don't know how much vinegar to put in the results would end up differently another thing we would need to know is what size of container to put the vinegar in we would also need to know what object to put in what amount of vinegar
2116,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was present in the containers and the size of the rock sample to assure that the rock came in contact with the same amount of vinegar on it's surface in both experiments i would also want to know they type of vinegar so i could use the same kind
2117,1,3,in order to replicate the lab that the students made the procedure for you would have to know what kind of materials you are using for the practical to place in the vinegar also you would need to measure what after placing below you should go through before including the labs you also need to know how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to use
2118,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment they should also put so the procedure how much vinegar so the amount of liquid is equal where they should sit dry a window canter if its on anything under a light etc how do you rinse it with distilled water also you use soap let it sank to get vinegar out or do you dump water on it then let it dry
2119,1,1,the exact amount vinegar poured in each container how to measure the amount of mass each has
2120,1,2,the amount of vinegar the temperature of the room and the marble should be the same size
2121,1,2,you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the different samples you would need to know also what one marene you put into the container and label and you would need to know exactly what material you put with each samples
2122,1,2,the groups procedure is although somewhat thorough hard to replicate in order foreach sample to get the same treatment and be as accurate as possible you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers you also would need to know how much water to rinse with the right factor is also important the students should be more specific about where the samples should be put rather light or dark because this effects the outcome
2123,1,2,some additional information needed to repeat this process would be how much vinegar to put in each container if we should let the samples sit in room temperature or in hot and colder area new to determine the mass and how much of each sample should we place into the single container
2124,1,0,they didn't come up with conclusions they problem thesis
2125,1,2,the additional information from the procedure is what the samples are it tells you in the table but you wouldn't be given that along with the procedure secondly you need to know what containers you should be using lastly you will need to know what the materials are and also how to determine the mass of each sample
2126,1,2,in the groups procedure instead of just saying a container say what kind and it's size the procedure needs to include what you see to weigh the samples the procedure needs to be more specific with the samples i would need to know if i had to treat each sample differently
2127,1,3,i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the different samples i would also need to know in what kind of container because the material can effect the outcome and whether to leave the containers in room temperature or in the heat
2128,1,1,after reading the groups procedure the information that i would add would be to determine how much material i would add to one cup i would also need to know how much distilled water is needed in the cup after doing that i would also need know how much vinegar is allowed in the cup
2129,1,1,to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i need to put into the containers i would need to know how to measure the mass in
2130,1,1,you would need to know that you have to mass it before you do anything and you have to mass it after the whole expirement you need to know how much vinegar to pour on the samples
2131,1,1,the group should specify what are the four different samples more information is needed on what should be done to the samples during the 24 hours also we need to know what kind of instrurrent is used to measure the sample
2132,1,1,one thing that you would need to know is how much vinegar your using another thing would be how your going to weigh these materials lastly you would need to know exactly what your looking for in these materials such as if they dissolved or grew
2133,1,1,in order to demonstrate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each cup you also would need to know how to determine the mass which would go in the first step of the procedure the samples also should be rinsed with the same amount of water which should also be in the procedure
2134,1,2,the additional information that needs to be added to the procedure is what are they measuring everything in also we would need to know what size containers they used small medium or large plus where are they removing the samples from we would need to know that before we even start the lab last how are we going to find the mass by a triple beam balance the procedure needs more information or we can't even start the lab
2135,1,0,additional information you would need would be why they are doing this experiment purpose statement more trials of the experiment and a control
2136,1,3,first you would have to say what the samples have to be you also have to say how much vinegar to pour in the containers and how big the containers should be
2137,1,3,i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container where are we going to put the containers so they get the same amount of heat sunlight how long should you rinse it for
2138,1,0,i would need all four samples ad the old results and vingar also water and containers
2139,1,2,you would need to know how much of the sample was used also you would need to know how much vinegar was used and lastly you would need to know how big the conde is used and put the samples into
2140,1,2,the additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is the mass of the cup used if i were to measure the material in a cup the cup also has a mass so you will have to substance that one also you would need to know the actual names of the sample being used the procedure does not include that information and that is vital to hav the other thing that i would to know is how much vinegar to the top of the container specified just a little bit
2141,1,3,some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is first off how mach vinegar to pour in each container using to much or to little vinegar can skew the results secondly i would need to know in what condition i should plac the container in it is possible heat and light may alter the results finally i would need to know if the containers should be covered or not the samples being exposed to oxygen can also alter the results
2142,1,1,1 if put not show wait so lable p 2 how long we p 3 expt more about the
2143,1,2,in order to repeat this experiment on my own the group of students should have first off talked about what the four samples they were testing were also they should have told us the amount vinegar that was needed to be used in each sample and lastly they should have explained in their procedure to calculate the difference in their starting mass and ending mass
2144,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment i will need to know more information such as how much vinigar in each of four seprate containers and how long the experiment is pecific mersurements will help also
2145,1,3,in step one i would need to know what the four samples were that i was determining mass of in step two i would need to how much vinegar to pour into the containers i would need to know what temperature to place the samples at in step 4
2146,1,0,you'd need a stop wacth you'd need to be there at the exact time leave the mass
2147,1,2,after reading the group's procedure one piece of additional information that would need to be included to replicate their experiment would be including the names of the four different samples that are being tested another piece of information should be that in steps 1 and 6 that you make sure to record each separate mass and not just determine them a final piece of information should be how much vinegar to pour in
2148,1,2,the additional information needed in this experiment is minimum of three such as in number in number two they should tell you how much vinegar should be added in the four separate containers also when they say to put the sample material in the container they should say if there is a size limit most of all to find out the mass you need to show what unit they measured in so you can get the correct or some data as them
2149,1,0,in order to replicate this expierement i would need to have all the materials that are found in this procedure i would then gather all of my materials and follow the procedure and also record my data down on a piece of paper in expierements i always like to bring a watch for timing the samples just in case there are none around
2150,1,2,after reading the group's procedure i would need more specific information to replicate the experiment first the procedure says to pour vinegar in each container but it does not specify how much should be used also the procedure doesn't say what size container i would use for each of the containers used in the experiment last the procedure doesn't say where i should pour the residue after the rinse
2151,1,2,after reading the group's procedure i then figured out how they could replicate it they could change the amount of vinegar they put in each sample also they can record the room temperature to see if it changes within the 24 hours finally they can change the type of water that they use in step 4 to make a difference
2152,1,0,in order to replicate this experiment i would need the mass of the containers a description of the container and a control in order to maximize the accuracy of the data
2153,1,0,to replicate the experement i would need to know the problem of the experiment what the mass of the sample has to do with the experiment and what the marble limestone wood and plastic are for
2154,1,2,in order to replicate the groups procedure you would need to know the amount of vinegar they used they would need a control group and the amount of distilled water used to rinse the materials they also need amount of time in distilled water more trials could be done for accuracy
2155,1,3,first the procedure needs is specific which materials are being used as sample in the procedure there was and mention of the samples being marbles of any kind also the procedure doesn't a tempt to control the amount of vinegar in each container this is necessary to replicate the experiment as different volumes of vineea eased after the estume the procedure finally needs to keep the size of the marbles constant surface area may be a factor in the experiment
2156,1,3,after reading the group procedure some additional information that should be added is to list what numbers steps that you have to repeat because it a little confusing on what steps to repeat another one is to list out the materials it has no information on what materials are being used only in the data table which was done after the experiment next thing they should add is the amount of vinegar water etc that is need for the experiment for all trials and lastly they should be specific about where to put thing for example where do you put the materiasl often washing them off
2157,1,2,after reading the groups procedure 4 things that would need to be added are that they would need to identify the four different samples they would need to tell you the amount of vinegar to put in each cup they would need a control and lastly they would need to do multiple trials in order for it to be a valid experiment
2158,1,3,to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container it doesn't tellyou how much vinegar you need also i would need to know the size of the samples should they all be the same size or different it doesn't tell you what size the samples should be the last piece of information i would need is what the samples even are the procedure doesn't tell you which materials to even use
2159,1,3,i would need to know what kind of container the sample were put in and the amount of vinegar poured on the samples also the kind of vinegar
2160,1,2,in the groups procedure they do not include some details that are crucial for the experiment to be repeated first you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container you would also need to know how much of each sample was put into each tube you would also need to know if the experiment was repeated to see that there was no errors accidentally happened and you would need the name of the sample that you are useing
2161,1,1,one thing that they don't say that you need to replicate the experiment would be how much of the samples to use the procedure dosn't say that you need to find the difference in the masses
2162,1,3,in order to repeat this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar they poured into the container for each sample i would also need to know what kind of marble wood and plastic they used since there isn't one kind of each it would be useful to know what containers were used and hou long they rinsed the samples for
2163,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what to use to determine the mass of the 4 different samples since it does not state that in the procedure also the samples of the items should be added in because you have no idea what you are testing if they are not in the procedure also there should be a given amount of vinegar in the procedure not a vague description not having the same amount of vinegar in all 4 containers could affect the experiment
2164,1,2,in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers also i would need to know how long to rinse the rocks with distilled water without those pieces of information i could not precesily replicate the experiment
2165,1,1,another piece of information you might need is how much distilled water is used also if you are using the same amount of each sample even maybe how much vinegar you are using on each sample
2166,1,1,the additional information you would need to replicate the expirement wald be an accurate mesurement of vinegar being pared into the containers also an accurate measurement of the distilled water you would uses for each container to rinse it off after 24 hours
2167,1,2,for this group's experiment i would need to know how much vinegar i need in each cup i also do not know what the four different materials samples are so it would be nice to have some ideas they should also put down to try this two or three times all together so we have more than one of the tables to read
2168,1,2,there are three pieces of additional information that could be reach to replicate the experiment in steps 1 and 6 they say that they determine the mass of the samples we must know how they do the or what ri they use also in steps 2 they say pour vinegar we must know how much vinegar to put into each container lastly in step 4 they say to rinse each sample we must know for how long or what methods were used to accomplich this
2169,1,2,to replicate this experiment you would need a specific amount a vinagar you would also need to know what the 4 samples were you also need to have water in the containers containing the vinagar
2170,1,1,what information i would need would pcobbaly be marble limestone and wood
2171,1,2,the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you are supposed to put in each of the four containers another information that you will need is what's the sizes of each of the four containers because when you put the vinegar it has to be on equal amounts and if you don't know the sizes of the containers it will affect the experiment
2172,1,2,in this experiment the procedure did not tell us what the four materials were they never told us how big the containers should be and after pouring vinegar into the containers why would you get another container to put them in it was very confusing
2173,1,0,first you would need to gather your materials then because safety is first make sure you are ready with goggles and gloves after you organize yourself you then determine the mass of four different samples and so on after the experiment you complete your data with the following information and a graph chart
2174,1,3,the students needed to explain what samples they were using in the procedure they needed to say how much vinegar to use and what type of vinigar to use
2175,1,1,you would need to know how much vinegar to put in the cup how much sample for each cup and how much distilled water to use to rinse with you must know all these measurements or the experiment could be wrong the data could be wrong which would the make your lab report conclusion wrong
2176,1,3,what kind of containers are needed what are the four different samples how much vinegar do you put in to each container
2177,1,0,i would pour the vinegar in non identical container so you could know which is which you could measure how much you put in to the cup or containers they could have done the trial more than once to make it was correct
2178,1,0,marble limestone and plastic all absent in the negetives in differences
2179,1,1,in order to replicate that experiment you need to say what 4 different samples you are using you also need to say how you are going to label the cups in measuring the 4 different samples you need to say how to mease you lastly need to mention the materials you need to use for that procedure
2180,1,2,to make this procedure complete there should be specification about how big the containers are there should also be specification about how much vinegar you pour in these containers lastly saying how you determine the mass of each sample hey
2181,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to add what the four examples are in the procedures that way the experiment know what they're working with you would also include a control and independent dependant variables also take observations
2182,1,2,you will need to know exactly what materials are needed you must also know how much vinegar to put in each cup also the starting weight of each
2183,1,2,1 what shape the samples were p 2 what type of vinegar was used p 3 what type of marble limestone wood and plastic was used
2184,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar is being put into each cup the specific types of plastic wood limestone and marble and how long the samples were rinsed for
2185,1,2,in order for me to replicate this experiment i would need to know need to knew how big each container was the holds the samples i would need to know much vinegar to put in each container also i would need to know how to measure the mass of the 3 objects
2186,1,1,i would need to know the materials that are going to get measured the amount of time that each material stayed in the vinegar the staring mass and the ending mass of each material
2187,1,1,the information needed would be what is trying to be proven with this investigation also they would need to state what the original samples are thickness of each original sample
2188,1,0,i will need a balance to weight the mass of four different samples replace vinegar for lemon and put in each four edentically after 24 hours i will use water to rinse each sample after i will use the balance to check if there is any change in the mass of each
2189,1,0,additional information i would need in order to replicate this experiment is that i would need to know what measuring tool to use in order to weigh the samples triple beam balance i would also need to determine the difference in the mass of the samples the group showed the difference on their data table but didn't list that step in their procedure lastly i would need to record every different mass on the data table which also isn't a step in the group's procedure
2190,1,2,in addition to the procedure in acid rain experiment they forgot to state their hypothesis but in the beginning they also forgot to state their materials such as marble limestone wood plastic in their procedure or how much vinegar in each solution
2191,1,0,what the procedure is asking is for them to find away how to make acid rain yo will need containers to hold the rain then your will need to label the containers after 24 hours they will be ready to then find out the mass
2192,1,1,the additional information i will need in order to replicate the experiment is the procedures so i know what im doing the samples so i know what im working on then starting mass
2193,1,3,one thing someone would need is which materials they are testing if the procedure doesn't include marble limestone etc then it can't be replicated the procedure should also include how much vinegar to put into each container because of this faster mass not controlled the experiment won't be valid finally the students need to add where to keep the containers because different environments can affect the results they get for each
2194,1,0,i would need there 1 prediction to what they were really questioning i would probably say the date and time also including there conclusion
2195,1,0,they did not look up data about acid bain and they need t
2196,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment first of all the samples would need to be identified as samples of they should start out at roughly the same mass as well the amount of vinegar should have been constant for each container how were the containers labeled numerically or by name
2197,1,3,the information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the samples and container sizes also you need lables to identify each sonified container the same amount andend of vinegar and water finally the same amount of time and creat a lable the somewhere
2198,1,3,some additional information i would need to complete the experiment would be to know what the samples are in the procedure also i would need to know how big the containers need to be and how much vinegar to pour in also i would need to know what temperature the samples need to be at also if they are covered or uncovered then i would need to run a control of water on the samples and run the experiment multiple times
2199,1,2,in order for me to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinigar to pour in with the stones another thing i would need to know is what are the four materials no where in the procedure is there names of stones another would be how much of the sample to use in grams nowhere in the procedure is there an indication of the mass
2200,1,2,they will need to include how much vinegar to put into the containers they also need to make sure that the samples have the same orrigional mass i will also need to know what the control is and how many times re repeat the experiment for valitity also how long should we nase the samples for
2201,1,2,to do this experiment you need to know how much sample to put in a cup the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the cup with the sample in it and how many trials to do the experiment
2202,1,1,for me too replicate this experiment the additional information i would need is were did they sit the container did it sit in the room freezer were they all so could of told use if they used move traits or not
2203,1,0,this procedure can be improved you must keep everything constant including the amount of starting mass which was not done in this experiment multiple trials would prevent many errors from being recorded because there would be materials to keep the numbers in the appropriate range a control should also be added such as not pouring anything on one of each sample the corrections will make the lab much more accurate
2204,1,0,you will need marble limestone wood because they the variable pieces in this experiment you will need to experiment with all of there
2205,1,1,in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know what size the containers need to be also you need to know what are the containers bowls plates cups and you would also need to know to determine the mass of each sample
2206,1,0,i would like to have known why were they doing this experiment and why didn't or the samples get compare with warer by the vinegar
2207,1,0,well first a problem statement would be helpful knowing there independent and dependent variable also knowing their controle group would have helped
2208,1,2,in order to replicate this experiment i need to know how much vinegar to put into 4 seprate containers i need to know what material to use so without the information that i listed i would not be able to do this experiment 30 minutes it was done the first time with the information that they left of was in there then i would be able to replicate this experiment
2209,1,3,i would need to know how much vinegar is to be put in each container i would also need to know how long i had to rinse each item i also need to know what the samples were dried on
2210,1,3,in order to replicate this experiment the procedure would have to say which samples to use it actually only says place a sample of one material into a container i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container the procedure only says pour vinegar in each of four seperate but identical containers for this step i would need to know what size of containers i should use for the experiment i would also have to measure each sample before and after doing the lab so i would add that to my procedure
2211,1,2,additional information i com to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in the containers how many rocks should be placed in the container and how large the containers should be this additional information would help me to replicate the acid rain experiment
2212,1,1,the group would need to tell me what type of container to use am i using a bucket a beaker or what do i put all the materials in separate containers at the same time or do i wait until the first one is finished to start the second one what am i removing the samples with my hands tongs what this is the additional info needed to replicate this experiment
2213,1,2,i will need to no what are the names of the four different samples i'm determarning the mass i will also need to no what units am i measuring by but last but not least i will need to no how big is the container is
2214,1,0,what could be added to this groups procedure is they could perform more trials so that they could get more results they also could find a control so that they could compare all of their answers to now the control was affected and they also could move vinegar the four different samples right after they took them out of the vinegar because the water could have had as affect an their accurate
2215,1,1,further information would include why or what purpose the students were conducting the expirement what size the samples were and explain why each sample is a different mass p the purpose was to record and compare the mass of each sample
2216,1,0,in order to replicate this experiment you would need is to know how many containers we would need
2217,1,1,to replicate the experiment we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container because it doesn't give a specific amount we would also need to know how much water we need to rinse the samples off with after the 24 hours also we need to know what we are determining the mass with because the procedure just says find the mass
2218,1,2,one thing you should need to know would be to know what type of sample you would need to set if you don't know what sample to use then the experiment is useless also you should know how much of the vinegar to put into each of the containers and finally you should know what to weigh your sample on and if you should set the weigher to 0 before weighing it in you need to know what to weigh it on before there are many different weighing systems for biology and if you don't know which are to use then your lab might cam out wrong
2219,1,2,first of all we would need to to knew what the four different sample are this way we can talk about it in our data and conclusion also we meed to know how much vinegar to pour into each container because that is a controlled variable lastly it never says to messure infroms so we do not know how much of the material we should be measuring
2220,1,3,additional information i would need to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinergar to place with the samples also i need to know if there were certain temperature the samples needed to be placed in the last thing i need to know is what type of containers to put the samples in you don't know if the vinegar is going to affect the containers
2221,1,2,in order for me to replicate the experiment i would need to know where the containers were kept for 24 hours also i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the four separate containers last but not least i would need to know how much of plastic wood limestone and marbles to put into the containers of vinegar to repeat this experiment
2222,1,3,one piece of information that would be needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinigar was added to the containers another piece of information needed is what kind of containers were used in the investigation finally the last poice of information needed to replicate the investigation is how long would the samples be rinsed with distilled water also how much water was used to rinse
2223,1,0,you place the sample of one material container into one container and label repeat the sample iinto a single container after 24 hours remove the dry sample and rinse each sample with distilled water allow the sample to sit and dry for 30 min
2224,1,2,you would need to know the size of the containers what brand of vinigar was used so that there can be no change in data last you would need to know what it was weighed on
2225,1,2,in order some to replicate i need to know how big each container was how much vinegar was poured on the the subjects also i would need each of the subjects to have the same mass show it would be more correct it it was all the same size
2226,1,0,if i wanted to make the same kind of experiment i would pour vinegar in each of the 4 separate but identical containers then i would wait 24 hours then rinse each sample with distilled water finally allow all the samples to sit and dry for 30 min
2227,1,1,in orderto replicate the experiment i would need to know the 4 different samples used stated in the procedure i would also need to know what and why we are performing the experiment in other words the purpose and problem i would also need to have stated in the procedure to calculate the difference in mass
2228,1,1,in order to replicate this experiment the procedure would need to be rewritten with more detail first a step to record the mass of 4 samples before placing them in vinegar would need to be added next the procedure does not specify how much vinegar should be in each container another step they did not add was to re label the samples after they are removed from vinegar in order to tell them a part from each other
2229,1,1,after reading the groups procedure i would conclude that i will add a independent variable to the lab also i would want to place the containers in a constant temperature area for more accurate testing
4066,2,2,based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type b has the largest amount stretched two ways that the student could have improved the experimental decison is by allowing the weights to hang longer to see if the plastic would stretch more another way he could have improved his experiment is by doing a third trials to really be sure that his results are correct
4067,2,3,a sample b plastic has the most stretchability b one way it to add the original length of the plastic to the chart so you can find the difference of the original and after it stretched another way is to show the weight of the weights being put on
4068,2,2,the stretchiest plastic was plastic b in both trials and the least stretchiest plastic was plastic a in both trials p the student could have improved the experiment by adding a control and using the same length of each plastic
4069,2,1,a conclusion type a plastic stretched the most p b the student have used the same length of plastic for every type and should have did more than one trial
4070,2,1,a plastic type a and b stretched after being pulled apart for five minutes plastic type c and d either shrank in length or stayed the same p b the student should of added a control by hanging the plastics with no weight also the student should specify how much weight is on the clamp
4071,2,1,a based on the data of the table i conclude that plastic b was the most stretchable in both trials it proved to be always above 20mm p b the student could've used different clamps in his trials this would've expanded the student possibilities with the plastics to help with the validity the student could explain what he did different for trial t2 for the measures are not the same as t1 except for plastic type d in both trials the measures were the same
4072,2,2,the conclusion that i have drawn is that plastic b was the strongest plastic b was the strongest because in trial one it stretched the most to 22mm ther trial two b stretched to 23mm to improve the experiment design the student could state a length they want the sample plastic to be in the procedure the student should have stated labels that she he was measuring in
4073,2,3,a conclusion that can be dawn from the students experiment is that plastic b is able to stretch the farthest t1 22mm t2 23mm and plastic a stretched the least t1 10mm t2 12mm the validity of this experiment could have been improved greatly by doing these two things 1 making sure that the starting length of the plastics were all the same and 2 determining how much of the plastic will be stretched to the table at the beginning by doing these two things you're ensuring controlled variables therefore validating your experiment
4074,2,1,b two ways the students could improve the experiment is to doing it again and again until you get the same results another way could to leave the plastics hanging for longer
4075,2,3,i conclude that plastic type b is the most stretchable because according to the data plastic b in trial 1 stretched 22mm and trial 2 23mm unlike plastic type a which in t1 stretched 0mm and in trial 2 2mm one way the students could have improved their experiment would be of saying exactly how much weights to add and keep it the same for all the plastics another way they could have improved this experiment would be by having the same length of plastic for all the plastics also they could have done more trials to improve their experiment
4076,2,2,a based on the data the strectchiest polymer plastic of the four is plastic type b because in the both trials it stretched the most 22 and 23 mm p b 1 add more trials to increase accuracy of the results 2 repeat the experiment with heavier weights to see if it affects the results
4077,2,1,a the only type of plastic that appears to make no change with the 2 trials is plastic type d p b they could have improved their design validity by telling us exactly how much they measured in procedure 1 another would be they could do a 3rd trial
4078,2,3,a plastic type b is the most stretchable of all the plastic types type d was a close second plastic type a and c are not very stretchy p b to improve the validity of the experiment the student could have done 2 things give the length of the plastics they used and give the amount type of weights to weigh the plastic down with the information the experiment can be duplicated to get similar results
4079,2,1,thus for our experimentation our data has proved in conclusion that plastic type b and d recivied similiar results as also high strechibility on their first trial one way the students could have improved the data is by putting the tike in the data chart another way being how students could have improved their data is by telling the amount of weights added for stretching
4080,2,2,a plastic type b stretched the farthest in both trials type d stretched second farthest in each trial and c and a stretched the third and least farthest respectively the order of each plastic type's stretchiness remained the same in both trials p b the student could have done more trials they also could've used more specific types
4081,2,0,in conclusion this is what the plastic did in the first try and this is what happened in the second try the best plastic is plastic b because it hangs longer than the other p to make it better is hang it for 7 minutes maybe put something else than weight i think scissors
4082,2,1,a plastic d is the best type of plastic because it's the most stretchable unlike type a which is the least stretchable p b do another trial and add heavier weights
4083,2,1,trial 2 was the most stretched plastic because after stretching them a couple of times then they set loose and stretchier than the first time the most stretchiest was plastic b it has the most stretch than the others p the student could've kept it hanging maybe a little bit longer
4084,2,0,3 based on the data plastic d held the most weight plastic a held the least plastic c went down the second time so maybe it wasnt sturdy enough two ways they could improve their experiment is to use different sized plastics instead of putting it attached to the table it could be stretched over a cup by doing this it will hold more weight and they will get more acurate answers
4085,2,2,a when dealing with different types of plastic to find out their strechability i found that plastic type a that 1 had the least amount of stretchability with only 10mm whereas plastic type b trial two out measured a c and d's stretchability with 25mm p b 1 he could've specified the names of the plastics 2 he could've specified the weights added and made sure they're the same
4086,2,1,a d was the most and stayed the same tril 1 and tril 2 p b he should of done another tril to make sure if he got different same results
4087,2,2,based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most plastic type a did the least amount of stretching p they could have used more trials they also could have added on more weight over a period of time
4088,2,0,there is only two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is by telling the day or hour of the experiment and see if the student's hypothesis was correct or not
4089,2,0,the students that could of have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results its make sure all their supplies are there put the data table in order and follow the time as instructed
4090,2,2,a plastic type b was the superior in both trial 1 and trial 2 p b record the weight that was put on to show how much effected each plastic also conducting more trials and making a larger graph to show the growth and change of each plastic
4091,2,2,the plastic streatures more or less depending on the type could have reapeated it again to see what would happen used types of plastic
4092,2,1,based on the student data all different types of plastic was stretch more than others plastic b stretch the farthest plastic a stretched the lowest you can conclude that plastic b was the better plastic for the polymer investigation p 1 way student could have changed or tested the different plastics at different times way 2 remove the weight from 2 plastics and leave the other 2 with to see the outcome difference
4093,2,3,a plastic type b stretched the furthest making it the weakest type of plastic however plastic type a stretched the least making it the stordest b 1 the student should have had atleast one more trial for completely accurate results 2 the student should have more specific by giving units to measure length in and specific types of plastic
4094,2,3,a conclusion that i can draw from this data is that plastic type b stretched the most on both trials 22 23mm two things that could be improved in this experiment are that a third or more trials could be performed and also the amount of weight put on should be monitored and controlled
4095,2,2,a polymer plastic type b has the highest stretchability it had 22mm in t1 and 23mm in t2 none of the other types of plastics stretched further than 20mm on either trial p b the student could have tested more types of plastic or made more trials to improve the experiment
4096,2,1,i concluded that plastics a and b strech the most one way the students could have improved the design is by stating how much weight they were adding another way is if they recorded a control for validity
4097,2,2,a based on the data plastic d isn't very stretchy because it was the same length in both trials it didn't vary by even an inch plastic b must be stretchy because it stretched the largest in both trials b they could have included more trials they could have at in included the original length of the plastics before being stretched so you could compare see how much each one stretched
4098,2,1,3 a plastic type a stretched the most c b they could of had more trials and used more types of plastic
4099,2,1,for the conclusion it wasn't a big difference from the t1 and t2 it was more like 1 or 2 amount stretched from the first trial we did the procedure 2 times and have got different things most of the time p they could have had an empty plastic cup hanging from the plastic type to see it there was much difference the could have also don a third trial just to see if there was much difference
4100,2,3,the group can conclude that plastic type b is the most effective type of plastic according to the table plastic type b held 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2 that was the best closely followed by the type d with 20mm and 20mm in the experiment the group could have done 1 more trial to really reinforce the results along with that being said the group also should have measured the weight of the weights and kept the weight constant for more valid results
4101,2,2,a our expirament was successful some of the plastic that we stretched out increase during trial 2 p b they could have told us how long or wide the plastic has to be and how to rap if to the table
4102,2,1,based on the student's test plastic type b is the best plastic type b has the highest stretchability in both test the students could've improved their expirements by adding weights till the plastic broke performing a different test in trail 2
4103,2,2,a i can conclude based on the students data that plastic type b was the most stretchable and plastic type a was the least stretchable p b one way the student could have improved the experimental design was be first of all describing what kind of tape was used because simple weakest tape would probably not work in this situation the best kind of tape might be duct tape scratch tape or measuring tape so that needs to be specified also the student should have told us the exact amount of weight that should be used for each plastic if different amounts were placed measurements would be different and all inclusive the design needs to be more specific
4104,2,1,the plastic type a b increases except plastic c d plastic a increase from 10 mm to 12mm plastic b increases from 22mm to 23 mm plastic d stayed the same 20mm 20mm plastic c decrease from 14 mm to 13 mm p one way to improve this experiment is to allow them to hang for more time another way is to run more than two trials
4105,2,2,a based on the conclusion of the students data they took 4 pieces of plastic taped them to an edge of adesk claped wieghts to them and let them hang for 5 minutes then measured them to see how long they have stretched they did this twice for all four types of plastics so they got two results for all of the plastics b two ways the students could of improved their experimental design are one had at the same amount of weight on the different types of plastics also they could of had more trials so they could of had more results
4106,2,0,a a conclusion i can make base on this data is that all the specific plastic types had very different effects by either growing shrinking or staying the same p b two ways the student could have proved the experiment is to include where exactly this experiment is taking place and also the durability of the table being used
4107,2,1,i conclude that plastic type a has the most stretchability because from t1 to t2 it stretched two more mm and the rest did not stretch as much as type a one way this student could have improved the experiment design is by ofsonbing how much the clamp at the bottom of the plastic sample should weigh another improvent needs to be in step 5 the student needs to specify what kind of weights are needed and how heavy
4108,2,0,the different plastic type stretched different a plastic a in the t1 they stretched less the the t2 in the plastic b in the trial 2 they stretched one mm that the trial c the trial they stretched more than the trial 2 d they are equal p b the two ways the student could have improved to the experimental design or validity of the results is add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes the other is and then measure the length of the plastic types
4109,2,2,the student could have impoved this by being more specific for example the could say how long the piece of plastic is how much weight is being added to the plastic and to also shoe the type being used
4110,2,0,based on the data i can see that not all of the types of plastic stretched one type of plastic got smaller and one type stood the same one way that the student could have improved the experiment is by explaining what the four types of plastic were and second they could have drawn a graph to show the difference of the plastic before and after
4111,2,3,based on the data one can conclude that plastic type b has the highest stretchability because its average amount stretched is greater than any other types p two ways that the student could've improved the validity of the results would be to cut all out polymers to the same length and to add the same amount of weight to every polymer
4112,2,1,the polymer plastic type a b were stretch 2mm more after trial 2 plastic type c d obviously is a totally different type of polymer plastic which is not easy to stretch plastic type c decrease 1 mm while plastic type d stayed the same they could of improved there validity by mentioning how many weights they used for each trial also stating the different type of polymer plastics
4113,2,3,a plastic b has stretched out the furthest more than any other plastic i have tested the least stretched plastic is plastic type a which was at 10 for t1 and 12 for t2 type b stretched to 22 in t1 and 23 in t2 at the most stretchability type c was at 14 for t1 and 13 for t2 lastly type d was at type 20mm for t1 and t2 at 20 the students improved by starting to find out which polymer had the most stretchability b one way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add a control with all polymers plastic with stretching it out another to improve is to add more for starts such as same starting length of all plastics same weight same surface area
4114,2,3,based on the data plastic b stretched the most out of all the plastics so plastic b is the most stretchable polymer plastic out of the four plastics plastic a is the least stretchable because it only stretche10 12mm and plastic b stretched 22 23mm the students should have stated how much weight was more used and if they used the same amount of weights for each plastic also the plastics should all start out the same length to ensure validity
4115,2,3,a plastic type b has the most tensile strength because it stretched the farthest in both trials and plastic type a has the least tensile strength because it stretched the least in both trials p b the students could have indicated how many millimeters of plastic should be taped on top of the table and indicated how heavy each weight should be
4116,2,2,the conclution would be that plastic type d has streched the most and that plastic type a had streched the least one way the student could have improved the experement would be to tell people the mass of the weights used another thing the student could have done was to list the starting length of the plastic in his data table
4117,2,1,a conclusion based on the students data is b and d were measured out to be in the low both a and c were measured in the laend one way they could of improved the design is meseric the length of tin plastic before they added weight b a second way they could improve this design is tell us in the procedure when to measure after adding the weights on
4118,2,3,in the polymer investigation four different polymer plastics were tested for their stretchability in this experiment plastic type b stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least the results are reliable because of the two trials the amount stretched only different by 2 mm or the most disrupting our consistency in the experiment to improve this experiment i would run a third and fourth trial to develop an average amount stretched for each plastic type additionally i would make the length of each plastic type the same for a better comparison of each plastics amount stretched
4119,2,2,my conclusion would be that plastic a would be the most resistant plastic and plastic plastic b would be the stretchiest plastic one way the student could have improved the validity of the results could have been to run more trials for the samples of plastic one way to improve the experimentol design would be to change step 6 to repeat steps 1 5 for the remaining three plastic samples'' this would couse less confusion for people doing this procedure
4120,2,2,a based on the student data i conclude that plastic type b was the stretchiest of all plastics because in both trial 1 and 2 it got higher than 20 both times which was higher for any other plastic p b the student could have improved this experiment by having a constant amount of weight as put on all the plastics and he should have had a control group
4121,2,2,the experiment shows that plastic type b has the most tensile strength since it would have done to improve the experiment are to specify the amount of weight added and give specific starting length for each plastic perfeably the same length for each
4122,2,3,freom this experiment we can conclude that plastic type b stretched the farthest when weights were added to the pull of gravity they could improve the experiment by saying how many weighs should be added to the plastic to keep it constant also they could add more trials to increase the validity
4123,2,2,a based on the results of the experiment i believe that plastic c will take the most weight all the other plastics either extended when more weight was added or stayed the same plastic c though actually shrunk in size unlike plastic a which went from 10 to 12 and b which went from 22 23 mm and lastly d witch remained at 20 mm the whole duration p b a way the student could of improved the experiment validity is by having more trials and having the plastic strips the same length
4124,2,2,i conclude that plastic type b has a stronger materials compared to the other types p one way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more trials another way it would have been better is by saying how much weight was being used
4125,2,2,plastic type b stretches the most the students could have said how much heights they put on the plastics they could of also mentioned the amount of time the weights were on the ruler they could of said now much tape to use
4126,2,1,based on the students data type d's length stayed the same in both trials also type b had the highest length and type a the smallest this lab could be improved by stating the purpose of the second trial also since there are 2 trials the lengths should be averaged there also should have been a percise number of weights added
4127,2,2,in conclusion it seems that the plastic type b's outcome of amount stretched in mm was the highest against the other three p state what length you're excepting to keep them the same p also for better results the students should have done a third trial to be on the safe side
4128,2,0,a t2 the amount that was stretched in was more than the amount in t1 p b the student could have estimated 2
4129,2,0,a as the students where doing the right thing but they could have done it in more detail so we can now a little more p b the could have improved it by writing how many times they did it and record how long they did it for
4130,2,1,in conclusion plastic type b proved to be the most strechable after 5 mins reaching ti 22 23 mm stretched howevwr plastic type a proved to be the least stretchable after 5 mins reaching 10 mm in trial and 17 mm in trial 2 plastic type b proved to be the second least strechable and 20 mm at both trials and type c proved to be the second least strechable after five minutes in trial 1 it was 14mm long and in trial two it was 13 mm long a was the least stretchable while b was the most stretchable
4131,2,2,the data table showed us that plastic type b had stretched the most out of all other plastic type materials this exiperement could have more trails and more in formation of their producerse
4132,2,2,a according to the student's data plastic b stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial p b the student should have specified how much the weights weighed and how many of them to put on the clamp p the student should have specified what they were measuring the length of the plastic types with
4133,2,2,the plastic type did have an effect on the amount stretched as the plastic stretched from a to d the amount stretched in mm changed from 10 to 20 on the first trail and 12 to 20 on the second trial i say plastic b stretched the best becaused it stretched the most at 22 and 23 mm the first and second trials p the students expirement was not valid they could of done more trials they could of told us what type of plastic they used
4134,2,2,based on the experiment data i can conclude that plastic b has the greatest stretchability by stretching 22 23 mm the least stability plastic was a of only 10 12mm p the students could have improved the experience by adding independent dependent variables and completed 3 trials all with equal weights
4135,2,0,the plastics stretched a small amount in most in some stayed the same p he could of added more weights p waited more times
4136,2,2,a plastic type b stretched the furthest therefore it is the most flexible stretchable or most likely thinnest of all four plastic types type b finished with 22mm in the first trial and 23 in the second trial the least stretchable plastic type type a finished with 10mm in the first trial and 12 in the second trial p b this student should've identified the length which all four plastic samples should be to ensure that each is given a fair trial also the student should classify the size shape and amount of materials used preferably each type of material should be identical in ensure accuracy
4137,2,0,so in this lab i recorded four types of plastic type bags also i recorded the amount stretched in the four types of bags i did two tries each two things they could improve is their procedure list their data table also their results of the amount stretched
4138,2,3,a the students data concludes that plastic type a is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials p b the student could have made all the plastics the same starting length and added the same amount of weights each time
4139,2,3,a based on the student's data i can conclud that plastic type a stretched the least at 10mm t1 and 10mm on t2 plastic type b stretched the most with 22mm on t1 and 23mm on t2 b two ways that the student could improve the experimental design are set a size a weight to put on the clamp
4140,2,2,a based on the student's data plastic type d was the one that stretched the most making it the most durable for example plastic a only stretched 10mm while d stretched to 20mm also the second trial was important because for plastic a c different amounts of length was recorded p b one way to improve the experiment design is to tell how many weights are added to the clamps and how heavy they are the students can then use these weights to test another trial which would make the design better because plastic d stretched the same amount in both trials it'll be best to create a third trial for each plastic
4141,2,2,the conclusion that was made is that plastic type b stretched more in both trials compared to the othes 3 plastic types because plastic type got 22 and 23 mm for both trials while the next best plastic type got 20mm for both trials the student must include in the procedure the amount of weight to add for step 4 also they should explain more for instance like what does the clamp do
4142,2,2,based on the data i can conclude that plastic type b stretched the most out of any of the other plastics p two ways that the student could have improved the design and or validity of the results are by telling us what types of plastics second the student should have added a third part to the table how much weight was being applied
4143,2,3,the plastic type b stretched out the more in both trials than the other types of plastic p one way they could improve their experiment was to tell us how much weight they used on the clamps p another one is they could have written down the length of plastic before they started to see the difference
4144,2,1,there wasn't much of a difference between t1 and t2 it only stretched like 2mm at most and sometimes is even just stayed the same one way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 1 more trial another way the student could have improved the experiment is by using several other materials not just plastic
4145,2,3,based on the students data you can conclude that plastic b stretched the farthest and plastic a stretched the least two ways this student could have improved this experiment is by providing the start length of each plastic before the weights are added another thing they could do to improve this experiment is to include the weight that was added to the clamp for each plastic
4146,2,1,a based on the student's data plastic type b was the most stretchable p b first the students should have mentioned what type of plastic to use to replicate the experiment and it seems they used the same pieces of plastic for each type on both trials which could cause inaccuracies because the first trial may have stretched the plastic out too much for the second trial
4147,2,0,based on the students data my conclusion would be that t2 got more results than t1 two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design by giving more results and measurements
4148,2,3,a based on the data the polymer plastic b is at the top of the list of stretchability at about 22 5 mm p b one way the student could have improved the validity of the trial could be to add one or two more trials also he could have measured the spot were he put the type so thart each one started at the same spot
4149,2,3,plastic type b stretched the most out of all of the plastics however type a is the strongest of all of the plastics because it stretched the least and was able to support the weights p the student could have specified how much weight to add to each plastic to keep the trials constant they also should have specified which samples they were using and the size of each sample to maintain consistency throughout trials both of these would help improve the validity of the data
4150,2,1,the conclusion of this experiment is that plastic type b stretched the most with 23 mm with trial p 2 a way to improve this experiment is clarify what the plastics is tested for and if it needs to be stretchy or not stretchy also to use different amounts of weights to see what the main stretch is also a control in this experiment to compare to could help
4151,2,1,based on the students data you can conclude that for the most part all four types of plastic had almost the same length at mm stretched to the two trials p two ways the student can improve the experiment is that they could say what the starting length for each plastic type would be or they could increase the amount of time the plastic hangs from the table by
4152,2,1,well based on the student data plastic type b was the plastic that stretched the most on both trys one way that student could the valdity of her expirment would to have a control this way you have somthing to test the other results against
4153,2,1,based on the conclusion plastic type b resulted in the most stretched t1 22 t2 23 concluding that 1 4 it was the most strongest the students should have added a specific amount of weight to the clamps as the same and concluding the results on the plastic type lastly the student should have performed the second trial with different measurement
4154,2,1,plastic type b was the most stretchable and a was the least want longer than 3 min when adding the weights add more weights
4155,2,1,the results seem pretty good and i think that he could have done more data and more samples
4156,2,2,from the students data table one can conclude that plastic type 'b' and 'd' are more elastic are able to stretch more than plastic types 'a' and 'c' the students could have improved their experiment by specifying and controlling the amount of weight added to each clamp and mentionity and maintaining the beginning dimensions of the polymer that subjects including thickness
4157,2,2,a a conclusion that can be drawn from the students data can be that plastic type d has the most stretchability in both trials p b two ways the students could have improved the experiment design validity of the results could be 1 show each of the plastics original length before the trials 2 if they did a 3rd trial with a longer time of heavier weights
4158,2,1,from the graph shown i feel that plastic type b was more durable than the other plastic because at trial 1 it was the highest mm stretched and some for trial 2 p b two ways the student could have improved the design is to do more than just 2 trials they could've also done it in different measurements
4159,2,3,a i could conclude from this students experiment that plastic b was the stretchiest b the student could have made their experiment more reliable by specifying the amount of weight and adding a control on even stating how far to put the piece of plastic over the table
4160,2,3,a with the results provided it is shown that plastic type b stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second compared to plastic a this is about 11 5mm more stretchy b the students should have specified the weights amount that was to be added to the plastic they should have also said how much of the plastic should be taped to the table different amounts could affect the amount of weight it could hold
4161,2,1,in conclusson plastic type d has the most stretchability two ways that students could improve the experiment is by having a control they could also do more trials to receive a more acuret answer
4162,2,3,a plastic type b stretched the furthest in both trials therefore it would most likely break faster than the others plastic type a stretched the least amount so it would probably hold more before breaking b the students could have performed more trials they could've also use the same amount of weights each trial and for each plastic it doesn't say how much weight they used just to add weights
4163,2,1,a in conclusion if i take a sample of a type of plastic and measure its length then add weight to it and wait 5 minutes to see how much it is now p b two ways the student could have improve the experimental design is to add more trials another thing they could of did was try is add more thing for the weights
4164,2,2,the students doing polymer lab can now know plastic type b had stretched the most and plastic type a had stretched the least the second polymer had the greatest stretchability two ways they could have improved the design is taking the plastic over a cylindrical surface thats open and put weights on it to see if that affects it more also for better validity of their data they could've put how the plastic measured before and after instead of already skipping to the math part
4165,2,1,in the data tables there are four different kinds of plastic types and they had to be stretched by weights within both trials there wasn't really a difference just that plastic type b had the longest trail they could have told us what type of plastic wrap they used and they should have more trials
4166,2,2,a my conclusion is that plastic type b had the most stretchability out of all the tested plastics i came to this conclusion because as you see on the graph on t1 it reached 22 and t2 23 which was higher than all the other plastics tested p b they could have did more trials because the more they do the more accurate there result are lastly in the procedure when it says measure they should list the units they wanna use
4167,2,0,a 1 plastic 1 b stretched the most so it would be best to carry heavier objects p b 1 telling what kind of plastics they used were p 2 be more detailed by how long they stretched it for
4168,2,3,overall plastic b stretched the most followed by plastic d c then a this lab needs a lot of work for it to be valid first the amount of weight needs to be recorded also the origional lengths of the 4 plastics need to be on the table because although plastic b is the longest in the end it may have started at 20mm but we don't know also they should do more trials
4169,2,2,what i can conclude from the groups results is that polymer b has the least amount of resistance to stretching i know this because plastic type b stretched an average length of 22 5 mm this is larger than the three other plastics also plastic type a had the most resistance to stretching because it only stretched an average length of b11mm there is two ways to add validity and impede the experimental design one way is to add a control to the groups and second to have specific measurements for the amount of weight being added
4170,2,0,the students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results is add more weights to the clamp and take more time to change the data table
4171,2,3,based on the students data plastics b and d are the most stretchable because they stretched the most in trial 1 plastic b stretched 22 mm and plastic d stretched 20 mm p the student could have specified how heavy the weights should be on the plastics also the student must use plastic samples of the same lengths so the results have more validity
4172,2,0,what kind of plastic was it
4173,2,2,you can conclude that plastic b stretched the most and plastic a stretched the least one way the experiment could be improvd is making sure each plastic is the same length before the stretch another is to do the experiment for different time intervals like five ten and fifteen minutes instead of just five minutes
4174,2,3,based on the data we can conclude that plastic type a is the strongest of the four one way the student could have improved this experiment would be to first measure a specific amount all of the plastic types he could also specifically state the amount and heaviness of the weights also make that a control
4175,2,0,a conclusion i can draw based on the students data is that plastic type a stretched the shortest amount and that plastic type d didn't stretch at all but stretched the longest out of thin four types one way that this design could have been improved is if the plastic types could have been named and the procedure should have added now high the table was in order to make the experiment work better
4176,2,1,plastic d it not even strectch p b include sofleg make is and start with the same mass for the plastic hags
4177,2,1,the student's data was very accurate and it showed the less trechs plastic as well as the stretchiest plastic type in the end the students could have improved the experiment by adding more trials to the experiment also more weighes on the plastics to have more accurate ressults
4178,2,2,the students data is good the trial were coles in number it seems that plastic type b was the streched with a lenth of 22 and 23 so the two trials helped the way p i hes procedure he does not tell you what to meser in he said to put a weight on the end but how much
4179,2,1,the conclusion of this investigation is that plastic type a is the most provable because it stretched the most out of the four types the student could have improve this investigation by using all plastic types that were the same length also the student could have extended the stand time for trial 2
4180,2,2,a the more weight that was added onto the plastic bag and one longer the weights were on the plastic bag the more it had streched out out of all the plastic bags type d had the least amount of resistance to be streched plastic bag type a had the most amount of resistance to be streched p b one way that the experiment could have been improved was the amount of weight could have been specified a second way that the experiment could have been improved was more trials could have been conducted
4181,2,1,a plastic types a c are the least stretchy whereas plastic types b d are the most stretchy p 1 b define the original length as the plastic and keep it constant for all four plastics 2b use different sizes weights for the trial to see if their is a difference in data
4182,2,1,a conclusion that be drawn from the data table is that the plastic type b had the most weights although they could have improved their experiment by clamping are side to a table which the other side was clamping something that held the weights they also could've included the bag type and lenghth and width
4183,2,1,a in conclusion plastic type b stretched more than plastic type a c d the purpose of this experiment was to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability data shows that plastic type c stretched more than plastic type a but plastic b stretched more than all of the plastic types the student could have improved their design by labeling the plastics by name and adding it to procedure
4184,2,2,a based on the recorded data i am able to conclude that plastic b was a weak poly ethilen product in which it has the highest stretchability through out the experiment p the group could deffinetly improve their design by having each sample of plastic at a constant length therefor your results are more valid also the group could create intervals of time to show the results after 5 10 or 15 minutes to see the fluctuation
4185,2,3,a based on the students data i can conclude the b stretched the highest and a stretched the least p b the students could have told us how much the weights weighed they also could have told us the original length of the plastic before stretching it
4186,2,0,the student should have made the procedure less
4187,2,3,a i conclude that plastic b was the highest stretching plastic according to the graph it stretched 23mm plastic a is the least stretchable plastic it stretched only 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in trial two p b this experiment could have been improved by having each plastic stort at the same length and have the same amount of weight put on each plastic the chart should include the original starting lengths of each of the plastics and the ending length
4188,2,2,a plastic type b stretched the most p b they could have done multiple trials of each plastic
4189,2,0,a basically these students are trying to see which one of these bags are more durable than the other how much weight it can take p b the first way the students could have improved is that the could have measure the plastic and the second way they could have improve is to see how long they should leave it on before the bags break
4190,2,2,in conclusion the plastic material that was tested had a small amount of stretchability in the experiment the plastic was strech at least 1mor millameter greater in the second trial versus the first trial also plastic type d was the only plastic that had no change within the two trials know two things i would change is first have the starting lengths of the plastic to see the difference from start to finish also specify how much weight you are laying on the end of the plastic
4191,2,0,in conclusion the plastic type have more amout stretched that the other one in both trial for example in the first one he had 22 and the second he had 23
4192,2,3,a conclusion drown based on the students' data would be plastic type b stretched the most one way the students could have improved the validity of the results is to have each type of plastic start at the same length the students could have improved their experiment by putting the same amount of weights on each plastic
4193,2,2,a my conclusion is that plastic type b is the most stretchable p to make this experiment more exact like should have been more trial and their should also have a control test
4194,2,0,as shown in the data most of the test subjects stretch by one with so this project was a success p 1 he could have use more time on the weights p 2 he could have use different weights
4195,2,3,a plastic b stretched the most at an avarage of 22 5 mm p b add more trials explain how much waights are they using how much of tape to use
4196,2,1,a in conclusion it seems as though plastic type d was the weakest plastic being least as it stretched 20mm in each trial the strongest appears to be plastic a which barely stretched it was as an average of 11mm p b one way that the student would've made this experiment was to make sure the weights they were using were kept constant as this could easily affect how much the plastics stretched a second way the student could've improved these experiment would be to add weights and the drop of the bottom at the same time then immediately start taking so all the vinegar being used is both constant as well as the amount of time it's left hanging pf the plastic
4197,2,2,plastic type b has the most stretchability and plastic type a stretched only 10 and 12 mm for each trial and plastic type b stretched 22 mm and 23 mm for each trial p two ways to improve this experiment they probably should not use tape to hold the plastic on the table and they should try different amount of weights for different times
4198,2,1,the conclusion of the different plastics is that mostly all the stretched further in the second trial then the first trial p one was the student could have improved the experimental design is instead of using a clamp just use the weights and a second way the student could have improved the experimental design measure all plastics before anything else
4199,2,0,based on the data table i can conclude that plastic type a was a weaker or thinner plastic since it had stretched out the most also that plastic type d was strongest due to the fact that it didn't stretch at all a validity issue is that plastic type c had shrunk in size when the test was to see it stretch
4200,2,2,a the conclusion i came to is that plastic type d has the least strength there for it stretched the most p the student could have specified how many weights to add into each clamp the student also could've made each sample of plastic the same length so it would have been easier to measure and conclude how much the plastic stretched
4201,2,1,a that type b plastic is the strogest type of plastic they used in this investigation it held the same while streching the most p b one way they could have improved there data is which way the plastic was held with or against which has a big import also they did not state how much weight
4202,2,1,3a i would conclude that with basicly all the plastic that are being used in the experiment they are all very close in the amount stretched when they are all the same plastic typed from t1 to t2 p 3b and two way that a student could have improved the experiment was maybe having a t3 to see if it would change any of the data anything and keep the weights and clamps till it broke to really see how much it stretched
4203,2,0,my conclusion is that the numbers will go higher lowes and a way they can improve the trials is by putting more work in it so it can be a good grade or data count
4204,2,2,my conclusion is that for each plastic type it had stretched almost the exact same amount for both trials such as type d which had 20 for both trials the students could have improved the experimental design by being specific as to how many weights should be added they also should have written how far the cup should be hanging and to record their data
4205,2,2,a based on the data it can be concluded that plastic type b is the most stretchable p b the student should have improved the experimental design by being more specific and indicating how much weight was added to the clamp also the student could have experimented further by also testing the length of the bag after a longer period of time like 10 minutes
4206,2,1,a the table doesn't tell you much about how much they exactly stretched the students only put what i assume the end length of the marble nothing can really be told with this information p b they should mention the types of plastics in the procedure because its not clear as to what materials they are referring to also they should have mentioned this in the table on the table the original lengths should have been recorded because otherwise you cannot tell how much it actually stretched
4207,2,1,a it is clear that plastic d is the least elastic and that plastic a is the most elastic plastic p b to improve the validity of the results the student could have done a third trial and could have specified what the length was at each weight
4208,2,0,a in conclusion in the procedure it can be seen that plastic type a had the biggest difference in stretchability over the other polymer plastics p b two ways the student could have improved the experiment are in either add more weight to the plastics or to let the weight being off the plastics for more than five minutes
4209,2,2,a the conclusion that i drew is plastic type b was the best plastic for stretchability p b one way the design could have been better is to tell the reader how much weight to add to the clamp the results won't be as valid if one person adds a different amount of weight than another p another way the design could have been better is to tell the reader how much in mm of the bag should be taped to the table
4210,2,1,based on the students data for each trial the amount of plastic stretched it would first rise decreased then rise again p b 1 for the experimental design they could have explained how much do the weights weighed p 2 the student should've showed what type of plastic he used
4211,2,3,a plastic type b is the plastic that stretched the most plastic a was the one that stretched the least p b the students can improve the experiment by adding another trial also we could have mentioned how much weight he put on the clamp
4212,2,0,based on the students data all of the types of plastics managed to stay around the same amount of being stretched p i the students could have shown constants 2 the students could have explained how the experiment was done a little bit more
4213,2,2,based on the students data i could conclude that the material that can stretch the most is plastic b thats because it was able to stretch 22mm the first trial and 23m the second trial b the students could have put the table what kind of plastics that were being used in the procedure the students should have put how much the weight weighed
4214,2,1,1 he could of used the same amount of weight p 2 use a different conteince
4215,2,3,the students data shows that plastic b stretched the most 22mm 23 mm however this may not be valid because you don't know if the length affecting this amount of stretching caused by the weights the students can improve the results by using the same length for each plastic also they can include how much weight to add to the drops in the procedure to improve the experimental design
4216,2,2,a a conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type d had the same amount stretched for trial one and two which was 20 mm p b two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity is by keeping the sample piece of the type of plastics the same also to use the same types of weights
4217,2,1,a based on the students data plastic a stretched 2mm plastic b stretched 1mm plastic c didn't stretched it got stretch by 1mm and plastic d didn't change at all p b two ways that the students could have improved the experiment design and or validity of the results is first by making the procedures more clear second to make it more accurate the amount of weight should be the same since you're not measuring that and plastics should of been made of the same type of material
4218,2,3,in the students experiment it is clear that polymer b is the most stretchable than d c and last a the students could use more trials with these the experiment becomes more valid the students also could have said the size of the plastics sample since the size is in the final measurement this could alter the results by a lot
4219,2,1,a polymer based plastic d didnt stretch at all plastic a stretched the most p b run more trials to make sure you get the same or close results and let the weights sit on the plastic longer than five minutes to see if more time is givin will it strech more
4220,2,2,a plastic type a and b have increased in length from the first trial to the second trial while type c have decreased and type d have remained the same length b two ways would have to be add a certain amount of weights to hang instead of saying in step 4 add weights anyone who is recreating this experiment would have different amounts and 2 add more trials adding will help other understant and read the data more clearly
4221,2,3,a based on the data plastic type b is the most stretchy at 22 5mm average p b the student could have improved the experiment by specifying the amount of weight used and the location on the table to put the tape in case it is moved by the weights
4222,2,3,a b first the one plastic that's the stretchiest while a is the least stretchiest c p b one way is by having a third trial to make shure your data is corrected and by taking down how long the plastic was before you stretched it
4223,2,2,plastic b stretched the most for both trials on trial one it stretched 22mm on trial 2 it stretched 23mm the plastic that stretched the least has plastic a on trial 1 it stretched on trial 2 stretched 12mm a way the student could have improved this is to add more weight to each plastic and also another was to improve it is to have the plastics start at the same length
4224,2,1,a based on the students data plastic type d is the constant and will always be p 20mm but b is stretchies p b two ways the students could have improved this would have been to indentify the types of plastic and how much weight was being added
4225,2,1,in conclusion the data shows that plastic type b has the best stretchability in this experiment p the student could have improved the experiment by explaining what brand plastic he used for the experiment he could have listed the materials be used in the experiment
4226,2,2,a to conclude based on the data plastic type b has the most stretchability plastic type b was able to stretch 22 and 23mm while the closest streched plastic type a stretched 20 and 20 p b the student could have improved the experiment by telling a specific amount of weight and by being specific on what type of plastics they are using
4227,2,0,b the first would be to do second trial t2 different then the first trial t1 to be able to understand the difference of both experiment second would be to conduct a longer time setting to see how long it last
4228,2,3,a based on the student's data i can tell that plastic type b has the highest stretchability i e lasticity this is because b had stretched to 22 mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial2 which was more than other plastic types b one way the student could have taken each sample and measured how long it originally was instead of only measuring the length of plastic types for three plastic samples also the student could have had a third trial instead of just trial 1 and trial 2 making the results more valid
4229,2,0,in plastic type a there was a two milimeter increase between t1 and t2 plastic type b only increase by one in its two trials type c had a decrease of one in the trials and d showed no signs of change plastic a seems to be the most stretchable polymer these students could have improved their experiments by keeping the clamp and the weights on the plastic stretch it and then measure to test the durability of the polymer as well
4230,2,3,a conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type b stretched the most with a stretch of 23mm whereas all the other plastics stretched less than 20mm two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results are to run more trials and in the instruction give a certain length or size of the plastic type because one plastic maybe stronger with more size giving you unaccurate results
4231,2,3,a you can't really draw a conclusion because the length of the material before it was stretched was not recorded but the plastic with the biggest is plastic b and the least is plastc a p b they could measure the plastic before stretching and determine how large the weights should be
4232,2,2,a a good conclution for this would be that type be streched the furthest p b two ways the students could have made this better would to have tested exactly what type of plastic to use and how long each peice should be
4233,2,1,a in conclusion plastic type a and b increased two or one mm plastic type c decreased one mm and lastly plastic type d stayed the same so the only affected ones were plastic type a b and c p b one way the student could improve was to have another trial and a second way the student could improve was to add different weights
4234,2,3,the strongest plastic type was it because it stretched the most in both trials the weakest was b because it stretched the most in both trials so two ways they could have been improved was stay long in a special place on the plastics and using the same clamps
4235,2,2,a based on the data graph it is clear the polymer b is the most strecthable because in t1 it stretched 22 cm and in t2 it strectched 23cm beating the other polymers p b the two ways they could have bettered this project is by 1 add more trials to it and 2 they could have validated more by writing their hypothesis to their experiment
4236,2,0,my conclusion about this experiment is that t1 doesn't strech more than t2 and all types of plastic have more strech of equal than each other student could improve their result by making more steps to see what could happe for the next type of plastic if they stay the same lik plastic d or change
4237,2,2,a conclusion that can be drawn based on the data is that plastic b has the best stretchability because their average amount stretched was at least 2 5mm more than any of the other plastics however based on the procedure the data is not completely reliable one way to make it more reliable would be to make the weights added to the clamp constant because otherwise more weight could stretch the plastic farther creating more than one independent variable another way to improve the validity of the results would be to add a control for example a clamp with no weights for each type of plastic to ensure that the independent variable the plastic type is what affects the dependent variable the amount the plastic stretches
4238,2,1,a in conclusion putting the weights on each state caused the plastic to stretch it didn't stretch massively but it did make a difference p b one way the student could change it's experiment is by saying how much weight was on each state or the student could have added the types of plastic samples
4239,2,3,a the conclusion that could be drawn from the data is that after vetting the plastic hang for 5 minutes attatched to a clamp and weights plastic b had the most stretchability it stretched to 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second it was stretched 12 mm than plastic type a the least stretchable plastic in trial 2 and 11 more mm in the second trial p b to improve the validity of the data the student could have kept the starting length of the plastic constant and the weight of the weights added to the clamp keeping vairables constant will bring at more valid results
4240,2,3,plastic type a had the least stretchability at an average of 11 mm while plastic type b stretched the most averaging at 22 5 mm p the amount of weight added should be included in the procedure to make the test more valid preforming more trials will always make an experiment more valid in that could help here
4241,2,2,it was concluded that plastic type b stretched the most amount in both the second and first trial the student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials and having a control variables
4242,2,0,based on the student's data you can conclude that plastic type a has the most strechibility while plastic type c was the least amount stretched in the two trials while plastic type a's amount streched increased 2mm plastic type b's amount streched decreased 1mm two ways the student could have improved the experiment of design and or validity of the results would be by adding weights and letting them hang for different periods of time and trying to strech them in different ways
4243,2,2,a depending on the type of plastic will determine how much it will stretch with the added weights on it p b the students could have tried it more times and they could have other types of plastic as well
4244,2,2,my conclusion are that plastic type b is the strechiest it's the most durable and can hold the most height p 1 use the most durable tape you can find strong duet tape will probably be fine p 2 make sure all the plastic pieces are the same size and appropriate size
4245,2,3,i conclude that plastic b has the most stretchability p b all the plastics should have been the same length to begin with and make sure the same amount of weight is being put on the different types of plastics
4246,2,2,type d is the stretchiest most constant of the plastics tells how much weight to put on clamps tell how long the samples was
4247,2,0,in conclusion in trial2 the plastic stretched more than in trial p b the students could of improved by indicating what kind of plastic and by allowing to let them hang longer
4248,2,2,plastic type b has the best stretchability plastic type d was in 2nd place with 20 mm for both trials plastic type c had 14mm for trial 1 and 13mm for trial 2 plastic type a was the second so plastic type b with 22mm fro trial 1 and 23 for trial 2 is the winner p the students could have said how much weight is in the test another improvement could be to have 2 people and stretch the plastic since stretchability is being tested
4249,2,3,a if plastic types are added weight to stretched the plastic b will stretch the farthest this is supported by the data because in t1 and t2 it stretched the mos 22mm and 23mm p b first they should have measured the in trial length so there is no confusing data they also should have add more trials to improve the validity of the experiment
4250,2,3,a according to the data plastic a was the strongest because it stretched the least it stretched 10mm the first time and 12mm the second time plastic c was the second strongest followed by plastic d and then plastic b p b the student could have used the same weight or same amount of force on each bag also the student could have used the same sized plastics for each plastic and each trial
4251,2,2,a according to the students data polymer b stretched the most p b the student should specify the exact amount of weight to be attached to the plastic the student should also specify which direction the plastic should be stretched horizontally or vertically because the direction of the polymer chains affects the stretchiness of the plastic for example a plastic shopping bag tears easily from top to bottom but does not tear easily from side to side because the polymer chains are running top to bottom
4252,2,3,a in conclusion plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested plastic type a is the least stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested p b the student could've improved their experimental design by specifying the length of the plastics and by specifying how much the weights weighed
4253,2,2,in trial 2 plastic type a stretched 2more millimeters than in trial and plastic type d did not have any change p the student could have completed more trials also the student could have how many weights before breaking
4254,2,3,a a conclusion is that plastic type b has stretched the farthest in both trial 1 reaching 22mm and in trial 2 reaching 23mm the other 3 plastic types did not stretch as far as plastic b p b the student could have improved the experiment by recording how long the plastics were before they were stretched and adding that data in the table also the student could have made sure each plastic was the same length and width before each of them were stretched the student should have also listed the weight of the weights she used to stretch the plastic
4255,2,3,a conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that in both ones plastic type b has to stretch larger than my op the other three plastics this data is not valid because there are many places within the experiment to increase the validity the students could have recorded the starting length and ending length also they should have add the amount of weights a controlled variable and lost but not least the group should have had a third trial
4256,2,1,plastic b is the easiliest streached plastic p they could have done annother tryal with a different amount of weight they could have tested more samples
4257,2,2,a based on the student's data the conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type b had the most stretchability p b two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to include exactly what plastics were used also they could have added what step weights they used to stretch the plastics
4258,2,3,a based on the data i can assume that plastic b has the most stretchability because on both trials it stretched 21 and 23mm while the next closest only stretched 20mm p b one way the student could here improved the experiment design is to start with the same length of each plastic without othey are constant also the student could have specified the amount of weight that was out on the clamp and the student could also have made the amount of weight a constant
4259,2,0,in trial 1vs trial 2 there wasn't a tremendous difference in lengths if anything happened at all the length rised about 10 12 millimeters sample a had the least amount of millimeters but changed the most while sample d had the most amount of millimeters and didn't change at all p 1 use different sample of the same plastic for second trial p 2 make sure they are all coming from same temperature
4260,2,2,a plastic type b stretched more than any type in both of its trials b the student could have made sure each plastic was the same size to begin with also the student could have added the premier measurement to the chart so he she could draw more accurate conclusions
4261,2,0,draw a investigation is meatanese
4262,2,3,a after recording the data it is obvious that plastic type b can stretch the furthest and plastic type a stretches the least furthest p b one thing he could have done to improve his experiment was to list the weight as the weights because if there were different weights the entire experiment is forfeit another thing he could have done was to list the original length of plastic to see how much it actually stretched
4263,2,2,c a conclusion based on the students data is that plastic b c are the most resistant p the students could improve the experiment by trying it a third time and saying the amount of plastic use for all 4 plastic used this is how the students can improve the experiment to have a more valid result
4264,2,3,based on the students data polymer plastic type b has the most stretchability this is because the millimeters stretched on b trial 1 and 2 exeeded that of any other plastic 22mm 23mm the students could have included a third trial to increase the validity of the experiment the student also could made sure each sample of plastic began at the same length control
4265,2,2,a the a plastic stretched the most while plastic c shrunk an inch and d did not stretch at all b stretched an inch concluding that a was the most stretchable plastic p b they could have said how long to cut the plastic types and how much weight should be put on the clamp
4266,2,0,based on the information from the table plastic type a has more stretchability than the rest p the student could've tested longer because like i said before time is a factor in determining things when testing also the student should've added weights to the second trial
4267,2,2,i can conclude that plastic b streatchs out the most and plastic a streachs out the least i know this because plastic b streatches 22 to 23 and plastic a streachs 10 12 two was to improve this experiment is to tell what type of plastic and to add four more trials
4268,2,1,plastic b is a material that is the most flexible p two ways the student could have improved this experiment is having a control and measure all the plastics the same length when the experiment initiated a control will allow the student to compare data the constant will increase the data's validity
4269,2,1,a the polymer material b was the best in stretchability the polymer d was 3rd c was 2nd and a was the worst p b 1 they could have gave the polymer more time to stretch instead of just 5 min 2 they could have done test different polymers
4270,2,0,the plastics did not stretch as much in trial 2 t2 as they did in trial 1 t1 p the student could've explained what we were looking for maybe with a hypothesis they also could've identified the plastic types
4271,2,1,based on the data shown in the table i can conclued that plastic type d was to strech the most also that plastic type a streched the least p the students could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results by doing more trials and by telling the types of plasic used for the experiment
4272,2,1,the needed more trails also could more infomation and the most streched ploymer was 23
4273,2,1,it is a good experiment with nice ideas and it shows which plastic is most flexible the first way to improve the test is to use different brand name plastics to test the difference neat you need to do 3 trials to see if the lab is valid
4274,2,0,plastic type a is definately the streatchiest where as plastic type d is the least stretchy the student could have improved his experiment in many ways 2 of these ways include letting the plastic stretch more the students should have waited longer than 5 minutes the other way he she could have improved the experiment is by having a greater variety of plastics the student only tested 4 types of plastics when there are many more
4275,2,0,the plastic stretch out about the same they don't have that much difference the students could have kept adding weight to see how far the plastic would stretch they should have gone deeper and actually figured out the exact difference
4276,2,3,the student's data clearly shows tat plastic b has the most stretchability in that one it stretching to 22 mm and in trial two it stretched to 23 plastic d was a close second with 20 mm for both trials plastic c stretched 14 mm the first trial and 13 the second finally plastic a stretched the least it is obvious that plastic b was the stretchiest in comparison to the others with 10 mm in the first trial and 12 in the second to improve the experimental design of the students could make sure the pieces of plastic are the same length also they could use the same clamp and weights to ensure that the weigths added
4277,2,3,based on the student's data it is clear that plastic type b is the most stretchy because it was able to stretch 22mm and 23mm plastic type a was the least stretchable because it was only stretched 10mm and 12mm this is a difference of about 10mm p the students should have specified the length of the plastics making it consistent for all the different types would ensure a valid experiment in which only one variable was tested also they should have given a specific weight to be added to the clamp measure this you would have made the experiment more valid
4278,2,0,a a conclusion that could wiads from the students data is that trial 1 and trial 2 both basically had the same number if it could be one higher or one lower also the plastic type d is the most stretchable to both trials p b the student could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results by not only trying one experiment testing it in four 1 10 trials also the student could have been more specific with the plastic types
4279,2,2,based on the student's data i can conclude that plastic a stretched the farthest out of all the other types during the second trial another conclusion would be that plastic type d didn't stretch at all and stayed durable which means it's the strongest throughout the 1st and the 2nd trial two ways this experiment would be obtaining at minimum 3 trials to test its validity and the other would be to identify the type of plastic and more importantly start at the same length of each plastic to keep the validity of the experiment valid
4280,2,2,as you can see plastic type a stretched the least and type b stretched the most 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment design would be to tell whatt they are doing with the plastic and do a third trial the purpose of the experiment is unknown
4281,2,2,according to the students data we can now conclude that plastic b is the strechiest streching 22mm and 23mm on the second trial but one way the students could have emproved their expeirement is with in the procedure they should make it cleat that you need to have two of the same types of plastic for both trials so your not using the same one another way it could be improved is to explain how mezy and how much weight is being used and specify that each plastic should use the same weight
4282,2,2,a in conclusion plastic b was the most stretchable out of the group of plastic because in trial 1 plastic b stretched 22mm and in trial 2 plastic b stretched 23mm this compares to plastic a that stretched 10mm on the first trial and 12mm on the second trial which was the least stretchable p b the students conducting this experiment could have named specific plastics instead of saying 'take a sample of plastic' also the students could have taken measurements as the 5 minutes were passing multiple trials would have also helped prove the validity of this investigation
4283,2,0,a conclusion plastic type a stretched the least and plastic type d the most p 1 name type of plastic being used 2 what kind of weights are being used
4284,2,3,based on the students data plastic type b was the most flexible plastic a streches the least with an average growth of 11mm while in comparison plastic b had an average strech of 22 5mm p two ways the students could improve the experiment design and be the validity of the experiment are specify the a from of weight used and on another trial with heavier weights this will further parsue the plan and make sure all data accurate another thing the student could do to enhance the validity of the experiment is to start out with the same amount of each platic instead of measuring different lengths to start with
4285,2,1,in conclusion plastic type b had the best flexibility of 22 23mm amount stretched while a had 10 12mm c had 14 13mm and d had 20 20mm stretched so type b the best two ways improved their experiment is by using something other than a clamp thats also add on weight and to show on their data table how much weight the stretch could withstand
4286,2,2,based on the student's data i can make a conclusion that plastic type b stretched the most two way to improve this experiment for better results is on have a control they also can have more trials to make it more valid
4287,2,2,i can draw a conclusion that a had the best stretchability with t1 22 and t2 23 i am also conclude that plastic a had the best stretchability at t1 10 t2 12 what the student could have done to test her validity she could have had the amount of weight and she could have gives the names of the plastic
4288,2,0,they could of allowed the clamp to hang for 10 minutes they could of put more weight on the clamp
4289,2,2,a based on the student's data plastic b was the plastic that stretched the longest in both trials because it went 22mm and plastic a only went 10mm in trial 2 plastic b went 23mm and plastic d only went 20mm p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are by telling us how much weight to put in the clamp and having the average of both trials
4290,2,3,plastic type b stretched the most compared to the other plastics while plastic c did not stretch at all the students could improve the experiment by listing the starting measures of each plastic and performing three trials instead of 2
4291,2,2,a conclusion i can make based on the student's poulded data is that plastic type b was able to be stretched the farthest two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results is you should try the experiment at different temperatures not stretches the plastic would cold compressed the items of the polymer and list the weights they used how heavy they were
4292,2,2,a from this information i come to conclude plastic type b stretched the most out the four types plastic type d came next then c the a p b this student could made this lab better in two ways they could have told us how much weight to put on the plastics and they could have explained more how to measure it with inches or milimeters
4293,2,3,a in conclusion plastic type b has the most stretchability with an average of 22 5 mm stretch followed by plastic type d averaging 20 mm then plastic type c averaging 13 5 mm then the plastic with the lowest stretchability was plastic type a averaging 11 mm of stretch p b the student could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results by including that all the plastic types were equally cut and measure they could have also included to use the same amount of weights for each trial or experiment
4294,2,3,in conclusion the graph shown states that plastic type b streched the most compared to the rest of the types of plastic p one way the student can improve this experiment would he to use the same weights for each type of plastic another way would be to cut the same size of plastic for each type and trial
4295,2,2,a plastic type d stretched the most p they could have done 3 trials instead of two they could have told you the weight measurement
4296,2,2,plastic types a b c and d all stretched out over 10 mm in the first trial on the second trial plastic type c stretched out only 13mm less than trial one p constant amount of weight they could have also improved it by more trials
4297,2,2,a based on the students data i can conclude that the plastic bag b and d are the least desirable bags because they stretched far when the warm and weight were added plastic bags a and c where the most durable because they eld most stretch as far when the weights were added b one way the students could have improved the their design is by making all the bags length the same the student also could have made the weights a specific number so that all the types of plastic had the same amount of weight pulling on it
4298,2,2,based on the data i would say that plastic type b streached the most for both trials p the students didn't tell how big the weights were and they didn't have a control test
4299,2,2,a based on the student's data plastic type b had the most stretchabilty or was the stretchiest plastic p b the students could have used a control for example a non plastic to compare the stretchabilty and to help make a better conclusion and analysts the students could have used the same amount of weight for each plastic and each trial so that they wouldn't use more and different plastics and to ensure the accuracy validity of their data
4300,2,2,plastic b was the strongest out of all four plastics two ways that the experiment could have been improved is to have more trials and specific measurements
4301,2,0,the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity as the results and mave to decrease the differ as amount stretched an up from t1 to t2
4302,2,0,a i can conclude that plastic a stretched the longest 2mm and that plastic c did not stretch but decreased in length from 14mm to 13mm 1mm p b students could measure all the plastics aat the once and they could do something else
4303,2,2,the table shows that plastic type b stretched the most out of all of the plastic types plastic type b stretched 22mm in trial one and stretched 23mm in trial two plastic type d stretch 20mm in both trials them plastic type c stretched 14mm in trial one and 13mm in trial two and plastic type a stretched 10mm in trial one and 12mm in trial two two ways that the students could have improved their experiment design and on validity of the results are that they could have used the exact same weights everytime and said what types pf plastic they used
4304,2,1,a plastics will stretch and bend when weight is being applied to one end causing the plastic to be changed p b the students could have listed the types of plastics being used and listed the original length
4305,2,1,a the students data clearly shows that the more you data plastics a and b the longer they get but it is the opposite for c and d they only get stronger p b the students could have done 3 4 or even 5 tests something can go wrong in 1 test multiple tests would have shown more constant results lastly a materials list should have been added to help a person prepare for the experiment
4306,2,2,a a conclusion based on the student's data would be that plastic type b polymers with the most stretchability p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results would be one change the hanging time from five minutes to two or three and two add a third trial to make results more valid
4307,2,1,a my conclusion is that if the student kept on stretching this plastic type it would probably snapon the 3rd time p b two ways the student could have improved this experiment is by testing a third trial another way is the student could have put more weight on the plastic to see how the weight affected the plastic
4308,2,3,a plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic of all the bags because it stretched 22mm trial 1 23 trial 2 while the other plastics didn't stretch as much p b the student could've improved the experimental design by stating how many weights to place on the plastic and how much each weight weighs also they could've stated how much of the plastic should be taped onto the table and how much should hang freely
4309,2,3,a the conclusion drawn from this student's data is that plastic b is the most stretchable because it was the one that remained firm for the longest time p b two ways the student could have improved his procedure are he could have specified on how many weights to add to the clamp and how heavy they should be he could also have specified if each plastic needed to be the same length
4310,2,1,a plastic a with amount of stretchness was 10 13 and plastic c stretchness was 14 13 had the lowest stretchness plastic b and d with the stretchness around 20 23 were the highest ones with more stretchness p b two ways the students could improved the experimental design or validity of the results is by making more trials and making sure they measured the same amount of stretchiness correctly to be secure
4311,2,0,add the fist two togahtr and that how i do it
4312,2,1,1 acording to the data plastic b stretched the most and with the exeption of d the second trial tests only differed by 1 or 2 mm from the first test p 2 to have improved the experiment the student could have stretched the plastics longer the second time on used heavier weights during te second trial
4313,2,3,after the experiment was over we concluded that plastic type b has been stretched the furthest from the weights pulling it down plastic type d was the second most stretched plastic then after that was plastic type c and finally plastic type a p the students didn't show how long the plastic was before stretching it so we didn't know if all bags were the said length to start out another improvement could've have been telling exactly how much weight was added to the end of the bags
4314,2,0,to end our experiment we calculated our data together for plastic type a for t1 we got 10 for t2 we got 12 for b we got t1 22 and t2 12 for c we got t1 14 and t2 13 last for plastic type d t1 was 20 and t2 20 the students could of used less weight for step 4 the student also let the clamp hang longer with 10 more minutes
4315,2,2,i conclude that plastic b stretched the most its t1 was 22 and its t2 was 23 a c d their t1 and t2 was lower but d had 20 for t1 and t2 for validity the students could have done the weights for all the plastic together instead of doing it separate they could have done three trials instead of 2 trials
4316,2,2,it appears that plastic type b stretched out the most and plastic type a stretched out the least one way that the student could have improved their experiment would be to tell what kind of plastic to do also the student should have put how big the plastic was in the begining
4317,2,3,a a conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is plastic type b has more strechability than the other ones p two ways a student could improve the experiment design could be add more trials the minimum is three and also make sure the plastic are all the same size to begin with doing this could also increase the validity of the of the experiment and make it more accurate
4318,2,0,they could of added more weight and they could of let it hang for more than 5 min the con clusion i have based on the student's data is that t2 was more stretch out than t1
4319,2,0,a conclusion for the graph could be what they did to get to the end of their experiment p b one way the student could improve their self is by make there product better so the numbers stay higher instead of always decreasing another way is to make sure everything is all right
4320,2,2,a the plastic polymer with the most stretchablity was plastic type b this is because it stretched 22 and 23mm b two ways the student could told you what type of plastics they were using and how much weight was applied to stretch out the plastics
4321,2,1,in the trials the plastic type b stretched the farthest so from this least it is the strongest b the students could have improve their experiment by running 1 more trial for validity and a control to compare to
4322,2,1,a for the most part all of the plastics changed in some way except for one type p b the student could have done the experiment more then just two times to see how his her answers might have verifed
4323,2,3,a my conclusion on this experiment is plastic type a is the stronger because it stretched the least p b 2 ways that could of improved the experiment are make the plastic the same size and use the same amount of weights
4324,2,3,a based on the data i conclude that plastic type b stretched the most during both trials p b two ways the students could've improved their experiment was making the plastics all the same length before stretching them also specify what types size weighs because one person could put on a 1 pound weight and someone else could put on a 2 pound weight and get completely different results
4325,2,1,a based on the data type b stretched the most in both trials then any others type b had more elatistity and type a had the least elastisity p b this student could improve this experiment by recording the amount it stretched every 2 minutes also stating whether the same plastic used in t1 is used in t2
4326,2,1,based on the students data the conclusion will be that plastic b works better than the others in the first trial plastic b had 22 mm and the second trial plastic b had 23 mm p two ways the student would have improved the experimental design are to repeat the experiment another way is to add a control
4327,2,2,a plastic type b was the stretchest plastic type because in trial 1 it got 22 mm and it trial 2 it got 12 mm p b the student could have had the plastic types start at the same lengths and could have changed the experiment the which plastic is the most discrible
4328,2,3,a in conclusion plastic type b stretched the most ending up at 22 and 23 mm respectively p b two ways the student could've improved the design validity of the results is including how much weight is put on the clamps and also including the original size of plastic to begin with
4329,2,1,a the conclusion i have drawn from the students data is that plastic b has the most flexibility and plastic a has the least p b two ways the student could have improved his her data is by measuring each plastic before he she stretched it out the also could have
4330,2,1,b the student could have improved by describing how many weights are used and how much they weighed
4331,2,3,i would say that plastic tape b has the most streachability two ways the student could improve their designs would be to have a specific amount of weight so the expiriment is valid and they could add a third trial to make the expiriment more valid
4332,2,1,my conclusion to the experiment is that the best working plastics ar a b because they stretched out the most the second time the student could have run another trial and also added more weights to make sure it would really stretch
4333,2,2,a overall plastic type b had stretched the most plastic type b just stretched a little further this means that plastic type b had the most resistence to the weights clamps and this plastic would be the most durable to use b one way to improve the design would be to measure all the plastics to the same length so the results come out more accurate another way could be to have weights all be the same weight so some plastic types don't have advantage over others
4334,2,1,a the conclusion i drew from this experiment is that plastic d stretched the most it stretched 20mm while plastic a only stretched 12 mm p b the student could have replaced the samples before the second trial and made all of the sample the same length
4335,2,3,a from the data you can conclude that the plastic type b stretched the furthest p b the the could have done more experiments and they could tell how much weight so start out with
4336,2,1,the students could have averaged the two lengths of each plastic to get only one number for each they also should have done one more trail to make it reliable
4337,2,3,a the student's data shows that plastic type b had stretched the most out of the four types of polymer plastics p b one way the students could've improved the design and or validity of the results would be to make a third trial seeing as some of the results were changed another way would've been to tell the reader what weights to use and to make sure to use the same ones
4338,2,1,based on the student's data t2 seems to be able to stretch just a little more compared to t1 two ways to improve the experiment would be of course more trials and more valiability the student could get different brands of plastic from grocery stores and test which is more stretchable
4339,2,0,i think that the plastic types is going to be more danger because the student have add clamp to the bottom of the plastic types not only that but what the student could have done is to make the plastic type hung for more than 5 minutes and they could ha
4340,2,2,based on the experiment plastic type b was the stretchiest because it stretched the most from the weights placed in it two ways in which the students could have improved the experiment are specifying the number weights and how much they could weigh if the students did not use the same amount of weights for each plastic then these plastic are invalid
4341,2,1,my conclusion to the students data is that the sample that was used wasn't the correct form of solution and i think if they added make there experiment would've been successful
4342,2,1,a i conclude that plastic b is more strechable because it has the most higher length which is 23 and two trials p the student could have take a longer table and do all the plastic and attached the clamp in all of them while the one before was hanging for 5 mins
4343,2,2,plastic type b stretched longer then all the other plastic types b t1 was 22 and t2 was 23 is stretched the most weights in 5 minutes they students could have improved their experiment by doing another trial like t3 and see which plastic type held the most weight
4344,2,1,a the conclusion i drew form the student's data is that the plastic types a stretched out about the same each trial except for plastic type d which stayed the same p b two ways the students could have improved their experimental design or validized their results is by increasing the of weights and or time of the trials also another way that could have made their results more valid is by having more than just results more valid
4345,2,2,2 i can conclude that plastic b stretched the most amount out of all the other plastics p b the students could improve the experimental design by adding more trials and adding a control
4346,2,3,a when we tested four different polymer plastics to see which ones increased in length after adding weights the results read that plastic b increased the most by 22 23mm the plastic that increased by 10 12mm p b one way the students could have improved their procedure was by specifying how much weight they added to the plastics another way to improve validity is to add a third trial to the experiment
4347,2,2,the conclusion i have drawn based on the students data is that plastics b and d are the best polymers because those were the two plastics that had stretched the farthest on both trials p two ways the students could improve their experiment would be to do even more trials also they would need to make sure that the free edge hanging from the plastics are the same length each time
4348,2,2,a from the information of the graph i can conclude that plastic type b stretches the most for both trials the amount stretched was the highest p 3b ways those students could improve there expirement is by being more detailed in those procedure another way would be to perform more trials and even have another group recreate the experiment and compare notes
4349,2,2,plastic b is the strongest with the length of 23 one why the student could improve their results is how much the weights weigh another way is how heavy was the clamp
4350,2,0,in conclusion based on the student's data plastic type d had the same amount stretched 20mm however plastic type a had 10mm the first trial and it stretched more to 12 on the second trial two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by writing the types of plastic instead of type a b c and d another way the students could have improved is by adding a prediction to what they thought was going to happen
4351,2,1,according to the chart trial 1 was more effective than trial 2 the student couldve improven the experimet by using different materials than plastic or do at least one more trial t3
4352,2,3,i conclude that plastic type b is the most stretchable followed by type d followed by type c followed by type c followed by type a one way the experiment could be improved is by listing the starting ending lengths of the strips and to make sure all of the plastic starts at the same size another way to improve is to perform more than 2 trials
4353,2,1,a plastic type a is the most stretchable and type d is not stretchable at all p b that student could of done more trials of each plastic type and done a control of each
4354,2,1,based on the data plastic type b can be stretched more than the other plastics p 1 they could have said the type of plastic used 2 they could have added the average stretch
4355,2,3,based upon the student's information by performing this experiment plastic type b has stretched the most on average by 22 5 millimeters plastic type d come in 2nd with 20 mm type c in 3rd with 13 5 and type a in just with 11 p two ways that the student could have improved his experiment is by first allowing a length every plane of tape should be before starting the student could also provided a number of weights or amount of weight applied to are placed of type all of which should have the same amount
4356,2,2,a the conclusion based from the student data would be the more weights added to the plastic types the more likely it would be for the plastic to stretch p b the student could improve the experiment design by adding specifically how much the weights weigh another improvement would be to do more trials
4357,2,2,based on the data found by the students in the polymer investigation plastic b had the most tensile strength or could stretch the most tensile plastic a had the least tensile strength p the student could have improved the experiment by performing 3 or more trials for validity also the student could have included the weight of each weight that was stretching the plastic
4358,2,2,a my conclusion is that plastic type b stretched the farthest and plastic type a is thicker because it didn't stretch as much p b the student should have only did 3 trials and they should have told us what kind of plastic was used for the experiment
4359,2,3,3 a according to the results plastic type a is the strongest because it stretched the least in mm is the first trial and 12 mm in the second plastic type b is the weakest out of the four because it stretched the most 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second b these are ways the student could have made their experiment better 1 take all plastic samples with the same length 2 add weights into the clamp until the plastic stretches out to its full potential rather than ileting it hang for five minutes 3 do a third trial
4360,2,1,in conclusion the plastics were expirimented and plastic that had the potential to strech most was plastic b which results were 22mm in t1 and 23mm in t2 the one that least stretched was plastic a with 10mm in t1 and 12mm in t2 all the other plastics results that were tested were in between
4361,2,0,it seemed as if the plastic stretched further or stayed the same in these trials type a stretched from 10mm to 12mm type b 22mm to 23mm type c 14mm to 13mm and type d 20mm to 20mm p b the student should have been more specific with their table the student also could have stated his validity better in or while doing his experiment
4362,2,3,a according to the data it can be inferred that plastic b's polymer plastic stretches the most compared to the other plastics it can also be concluded that the data is prease due to the closeness of the number from the 1st trial to the 2nd trial p b the student could improve the experimeat by having the amount of plastic used a constant this allows the student to have only one independent variable the type of plastic they can also explain that the weights most be the same weight for plastic so the data is not effected
4363,2,2,a b stretched out the most because it stretched out a total of 45 mm a 22 c27 and d 40 b one way to improve the lab is instead of two trials do three find waay is have a control grone
4364,2,1,two ways that the student could have improved his experiment is by adding materials and also doing the experiment again
4365,2,3,a i can conclude that the plastic type b stretched the most it stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial p b one way this experiment could be improved is by adding more trials another way that this experiment could by improved is by telling or starting how long was each plastic type before stretching it
4366,2,2,a based off of the data table plastic b had the greatest stretch with 23mm while plastic a had the least with 10mm estretch p b two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to have more trials and also have a control
4367,2,3,a polyme b has the most stretchability whilepolyme a has the least stretchability p b the students should have included the measurements of the initial and final lengths the plastics samples they also should've recorded the amount of weight they used
4368,2,3,based on the students data i concluded that plastic type b was most stretchable and a was the least stretchy to improve the validity at this experiment they could have included the starting length how much the weights weighed ad also could of condicted a third or more trials
4369,2,0,the student showed that some plastics could be stretched by weights
4370,2,3,a one conclusion that i determined according to the data was that plastic type b stretched the most overall in both trial 1 and 2 another conclusion one could draw is that when conducting the experiment on plastics type d it was probably the most reliable and had many controls because the amount stretched mm stayed exactly the same p b one way the student have improved the experiment design was by measuring the same side of bag for a b c d in 1 another could be to add equal weights 4 to each type of bag
4371,2,2,based on the students data the polymer plastics all had had different weights because all stretched out differently to better the experiment the lab needs to include the stretching measurement so there can be data to compare before after another thing would to for all plastics is store on the same length this data is neccary to make just numbers on a graph to data
4372,2,3,in t1 and t2 b stretched out the most durring the 5 minutes p the student could improve his experiment by doing an extra trial for a more valid result as well the student could have stated in the experimental design the weights heavieness
4373,2,3,a based on the the data given to us in the answer banklet plastic type b stretched out the most compared to all the other plastic types in both trials p b the student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials which would of made the experiment more accurate another way would be specifying how much the weight and clamp actually weighed
4374,2,2,a plastic type b 's polymer has the most stretchability as shown in both trials and the polymer type in b is similar to the polymer in d due to the fact that their results are closest polymer in a is not very strecher nor is the one in c p b ways to improve both the design and validity include using something strongest than tape to hold up the plastic and weight also using a timer to improve valibility
4375,2,3,a according to the results of the students plastic b was stretched out the most for plastic a the results are 10 mm for t1 and 12 mm for t2 for plastic b the results are 22 mm for t1 and 23 for t2 plastic c the results are 14 mm for t1 and 13 mm for t2 lastly for plastic d the results are 20 mm for t1 and 20 mm for t2 b one way the students could have improved their experiment was they could have done more trials with the different types of plastic another way they could have improved was to show how many weights they used and what kind of plastic they used so we could see the effect they had according to the type
4376,2,0,a the student bottles have stretched more during was first atempt and plastic b was stretched the most during both p b the student could have improved his experiment by using 2 bottles to tape and not dorpping the other two bottles
4377,2,0,two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is they could of did a little more and took there time to make things good and do there best
4378,2,3,upon the completion of the experiment it was concluded that plastic type b stretched the most plastic b stretched on aver age 22 mm while plastic a stretched an average 11mm plastic c stretched an average 13 5 mm and plastic d stretched an average 20mm two ways that the group could have improved their experiment would be to include how big the clamp is and to include how much weight is being added to the clamp
4379,2,2,based on the students data i have come to the conclusion that plastic d is the most reliable polymer because it stretches the most by giving the measurement of plastic used for each trial the student could have improved the experiment design also by writing the amount of weights they use the students could have improved his experiment design
4380,2,3,a based on the student's data plastic b is the most stretchy p b two ways the students could have improved the experimental design would be to state how much weight to add to the clamp and to do 3 trials with an average instead of just two with no average
4381,2,2,a plastic a and b stretched more from trail one to to trail 2 plastic c went down one and d stayed the same b two ways the students could have improve the experimental design or validity of the results is they could have have done another trail for each plastic also they could have made sure all of the plastic were the same length to start off with
4382,2,3,based on the students trials plastic type b was the best one because it allowed the most stretching in its first test it scored the highest of 22mm and then in test 2 scored 23 mm also the highest plastic type b will stretch the most if weights was put on it and for 5 minutes 6p a the student could have improved this lab by adding specific measurements to certain steps such as how much weight should be added in step 4 b the student could have also improved rethis lab by making each plastic the same length in step 1 to just said to measure it not to cut it to a certain length if you make each one the same length the results will all be accurate
4383,2,1,plastic type a stretched longer the second that so did plastic type b plastic type d stretched the same both trials the student could of named the types of plastic or test it more than two times
4384,2,0,a the stretchability for the four different types of polymer plastics the calculations for trial one and trial two we almost the same for example plastic type a on trial one it was 10 and trial 2 it was 12 then on plastic type d for both trials it was 20 p the two ways they could have improved it was by putting weights in and making it heavier and the other one is you can also bring the plastic bags apart trying to rip them
4385,2,2,the conclusion in this experiment is that plastic type b is the most stretchability when the students added the weight to the plastic and it stretched out to do the longest in both trials trial 1 it was 22mm and in trial 2 it was 23mm 2 was that the students would of improved this experiment is to perform more trials to receive the most accurate answer and they could of had control and see how the plastics stretch with no weight on them
4386,2,3,based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most in the first trial it stretched 22 mm and in the second trail it stretched 23 mm the second most trial pliable material stretched 20 mm the student could have improved the design by using samples that were exactly the same length also he she could have stated how much weight they were using to stretch the material
4387,2,3,based on the data i can conclude they plastic b and d are the most flexible to improve the experiment students could have cut all the samples to the same length and they could have preformed more trials
4388,2,2,a plastic type b had the best stretchability while a had the worst type b stretched an average of 7 3 units longer in t1 and 8 units in t3 p b in their procedure they could've put measuring units be inches millimeters etc that they used they could've specified the amount of weight they were using in step 4
4389,2,3,according to this student's data plastic type b is the most stretchable of the types tried both trials you did and start do'n saying that it was stretched further than the other 3 samples which the data keeps accurately valid the experiment design was poor one way this student could have improved their design is to have been more specific in measurements the size of the plastic samples how much hangs are the tight etc another way to improve the validity of their results is to perform more than just 2 trials
4390,2,2,the data that the student got is corrupted the reason i say this is because he she should have wrote on the data table the starting measure of each bag he she could have also used the same amount of weight written it on the procedures to get more accurate results another way that the student could have improved would be doing another trial to make that the results are accurate
4391,2,3,in conclusion to the data gathered by the students i have come to the conclusion that the polymer plastic type a has streched the least therefore making it the most stable and that polymer plastic type b was the least to strech the most therefore being the least stable the students could have increased the validity of there results by adding more variables such as amount of weight applies as well as adding even more trials
4392,2,3,a it can be concluded that plastic type b stretched the most and plastic type a the least p b the student could have improved the experiment by using plastics that were all the same length and mass for example if b was a sample of plastic 1100 decametres long of course it would stretch farther than the rest also another problem going off of that is that the mass of the weights should remain consistent secondly to make elasticity certain more trials from different students should be done to make sure that the results are valid
4393,2,2,a according to the data table testing the stretchability on 4 different polymer plastics plastic b is the stretchiest because it stretched 22 23mm the other types of plastics didn't stretch this much p b one way this experimental design could be improved is to say the 4 different kinds of plastics used another way this can be improved is to tell us how much weight to add to the clamp when stretching the plastic
4394,2,2,to inquire hi experiment be could of said how much weight he added the the plastic bags each one was to have the same amount of weight second he should or had same type of measure ment on how long the bags where befor he did the experiment then show how long they got
4395,2,3,a based on the students data i can conclude that plastic is worked the best for both trials with 22 mm for that i and 23mm for trial 2 plastic d not 20mm for both trials plastic c with 14mm and 13mm and the least stretchy was plastic a with 10mm and 12mm b two ways they could have improved was to name the polymers such as bp they also could have said how much the clamps and the weights weighed
4396,2,1,a polymers c appears to have the greatest amount of streach ability p b the student could have added a control and performed more trials
4397,2,0,a the student found the two stretched plastics to be b and d they both have over 20 mm in both trials and performed much better than the two other trials p b the student could have improved his procedure of experiment by giving a hypothesis of just which plastic they thought would be the stretchiest after that they needed as if there hypothesis was correct and if not explain why it wasn't
4398,2,2,a a conclusion based on the student's data would be that plastic type a would be the stretchiest plastic because it stretched the most at two mm while type b and c stretched one mm and type d didn't stretch at all p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to record the measure of plastic before stretching on the data table and also to add more trials
4399,2,3,plastic b is the most stretchy p the student should have made sure all of the plastics were the same length before preforming the experiment if all the plastics are different lengths we have no way of knowing if they stretched because of the length or because of the type of plastic he or she should also have indicated the weight attached to the clamp otherwise the experiment cannot be repeated but repetition is an essential part of validity
4400,2,2,a plastic b stretched the longest in trial 2 23 mm and plastic d being the second longest and a having the shortest amount stretched p b the student could have had the clamps hang a longer time rather than just 5 minutes and they could of had a third trial because some plastic stretched longer the second time round
4401,2,0,based on the students data there really wasnt any difference in the animals stretched the students could have put more weights on they even could have extends the time hanging to improve the experiment design and or validing of the results
4402,2,2,a conclusion can be that plastic types b and d are more strecthable than plastic types a and c one way they could have improved is by adding the plastics' original length in the graph to help show that they did strecth another way is to have include the weight of the weights so that it can be duplicated if needed
4403,2,0,a plastic a stretched 2mm plastic b stretched 1mm plastic c stretch 1mm and plastic d didn't stretch p b the student could have done this over distinct results the student could have also checked his work more frequently to see exactly how long it took for each of the pieces of plastic to lower
4404,2,2,a as you can see plastic b could stretch longer than any plastic plastic d had similar results for both trials plastic a was the only plastic that was able to not stretch that far p b what this student should do to improve his experiment is to run more trials and to add what he is comparing to
4405,2,3,based on the information provided from the experiment i conclude that plastic b has the most stretchability 22mm 23m and plastic a is the least stretchability 10mm 12mm two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their lab was to cut the same length of each plastic prior to testing stretchability and to specify the amount and mass at the weights to added
4406,2,1,my conclusion is that the plastic that can stretch more is plastic b because it has the longest accounted stretched in mm and other plastics do not stretch longer than plastic b p two ways the student could have improved is by putting one set of weights in t1 and another st of weights in t2 also they could have improved by letting it hang for more time to see if they can resist
4407,2,3,a from this data it can be concluded that plastic b is the most flexible and plastic a is the least p b the student needs to perform at least 3 trials with each plastic for it to be valid also the student set a length at which plastic should initially be this will improve validity as well
4408,2,1,my conclusion is that the type of plastics similar to strength because none of them had a huge difference but type b and d are closer to farthest one is 23 the other 22 is now a and c are closer one is 12 the other 13 and type d stayed the same during both trials plus a way to improve this experiment would be have more trials because there wasn't that many data to compare and the ones they had wasn't relly of a difference
4409,2,2,a based on the students data plastic type b streched the most out of any other type of plastic b to improve the experiment the students could have increased the amount of time they would allow the pieces to strech further and another plastic could end up streching further all the plastic may have needed was more time to improve the validity of the results the students should have included the plastics orginal length in the table
4410,2,2,a as you guys can see the sample of plastic b was the most strechable plastic out of all of them the plastic b streched the most in both trials p b 1 ways that the student could of changed the experiment by labeling the plastics that he used 2 he also could of changed the weight of the clamp 3 he could of also added another try to make sure that witch is the most strechable plastic
4411,2,2,based upon the data plastic type b stretches the most the student could have had a designated amount of weight for adding to the clamps the student also should have put step 7 before step 6 to make things go along more smoothly
4412,2,3,a a conclusion of this experiment is type b stretched the most it stretched an average of 22 5mm this was greater then type d with an average of 20mmtpe c with 13 5mm and lastly a with 11mm p b two ways the student could have improved their experiment design validity is specify if the same amount of weight is being added and have 3trials to make sure numbers are accurate
4413,2,1,plastic type b held 22mm on the first trial and 23mm on the second trial so plastic type b held the most mm in both trials the only plastic close to it was plastic type d which had 20mm in trail 1 and 20mm in trial 2 since plastic type b held b held more in both trials then plastic type b is the can hold the most the way the students could have improved their experiment is by having more trials this would have improved the validity of their results another way is by making it longer than 5 minutes to let the plastics hang because it might leave longer stretch much
4414,2,2,a it seems like plastic b has the most stretch ability because it stretched 22 mm in t1 and 23 t2 p b to improve the experimental assign the students could have kept the amount of weight they carried to the bag constant and they could have kept the weights for another five minutes and measured it again afterwards
4415,2,2,in the second trail two plastics a and b stretched out more unlike 2 and b c stretched less the second time while d stayed the same one way the student could have improved his experiment is by doing it a third time to see which of the highest two were right a second would be showing the length of the plastics when the student first started
4416,2,1,a a conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type a is the strongest because t1 only stretched 10mm and t2 only stretched 12mm p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by naming the types of plastics that a used and by adding a control to the experimental design
4417,2,1,a a conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that a was the weakest and c was the most ourable are p b one wagt that it can be improved is to explain how c was unstretched another way for improvement was have more trials to see what happens to each of the plastics
4418,2,0,a my conclusion for this experiment is that trial 2 is going to get the most stretchability for the plastic type p b the plastic sample doesn't have to hang freely down the side of a table and before you perform the second trial just like the first add on additional 5 10 minutes to the procedure
4419,2,2,in this expierement we have learned that all bags tend to stretch when carrying weights in this expierement plastic type a proved to be the least stretchiest while plastic type proved to be stretched the most p the students could have said how many weights to be add or how heavy they total up to be p the students could have also said what type of plastics they used so we can test it our selves
4420,2,2,based on the students data the conclusion that plastic b has the most stretchability because it has the highest length in millimeters after the experiment two things the students could have done to improve the experimental design and validity of the results would be holding the variables more controll for example set the length of each plastic next if they had a set amount of weight the results would have come out more valid
4421,2,1,the students had 4 types of plastic a b c d they wanted to see which one would stretch the most they held 2 trials and b came out to be the stretches ist out of them all with a 22 23 mm
4422,2,2,based off of the data plastic type d had the longest stretchability while plastic type a had the least two ways the students could have improved their experiment would be better perform more trials or make sure that the weight applied to each plastic was the same
4423,2,1,a in the second trial plastic type a and b both had more mm but plastic type c in the first trial there was more and with plastic type d it was the same for both trials b they could repeat trials and use more different type of plastics
4424,2,2,a the order of plastics from most to least stretchy is b d c then a where a is the stretchiest and b the least the overall stretchings of the plastics remained mostly the same from t2 to t2 p b taping the plastic a specific distance in from the table edge and adding identical and specified amounts of weight to each plastic would improve the validity especially when working with such small length chances
4425,2,0,a based on the students data the plastic don't stretches a lot much type 1 and type 2 are almost the same and dont have a much difference p b
4426,2,3,a based on the data plastic b stretched the most out of the four plastics p b one way to improve the experiment is to specify how much the weights weigh 4 another way is to set a specific length pf plastic not just any measure the length 1
4427,2,2,a based on the resluts plastic type b was the best with the longest mm stretched in both trials 22 23 then type d with 20mm in both trials then c with 14mm 13mm finally type a with 10mm 12mm p b two ways that the students could improve their validity are 1 do more trials and 2 use more types of plastics
4428,2,2,a based on the students data from this experiment plastic type b had the greatest stretchability out of all four plastics p to be more accurate with the validity of their results would be to make sure the length of all the samples in both trials were equal for all types another way to improve i he experiment would be to increase the weights in the second trial by doubling them and then sampling the data from the two trials
4429,2,3,a plastic b can stretch the longest where as plastic a can not stretch as far p b one way to improve the experiment would be to specify a specific number and type of weights that are being added and to keep it constant also another few trials would prove its validity because there could be human errors and more trials would lead to more accurate data
4430,2,2,based on the experiment the best plastic based on stretchability would be plastic b it stretched 22 and 23 mm which is the most out of all the plastics plastic d would also be good stretching 20 mm plastic a and c were not so good stretching 10 12 and it 13 respectively one way the students could improve their experiment is to add a third trial b this would allow for better results because its experiment is being done 3 trials and an average could be made another improvement would be to add different weights to see how far each plastic will stretch
4431,2,1,1 the most stretchable plastic with the most tensile strength is plastic d because during both trials it stretched further than all the other plastics p 2 a they could have formulated a hypothesis so that their experiment would have become more guided b they could have made sure that each plastic before stretching was the same length
4432,2,0,a based on the students data my conclusion to this is that plastic type d would be the most stretchable because for both trials the mm of the length was still the same p b two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by telling the differences of the two trials and also did a different polymer plastic have an effect on how it would stretch
4433,2,2,a this experiment on polymers turned out to work perfectly without any weird results for example in this experiment plastic polymer b performed the best because in trial one it stretched about 22mm and in trial two it increased flexibility by stretching 23mm while on the other hand plastic polymer a experiment the worst because in trial one it only stretched about 4mm and in trial two it only increased its flexibility to 12mm p b two ways that those students could have improved this experiment is by naming the plastic in which they tested and also they should have measured how heavy the weights are to get a more set on judgement more trials more attempts more accurate results
4434,2,2,based on the data plastic a had the most significant growth in amount streched with streching 2 mm faster than it's original trial therefore this polymer has the most streachability p the student could of had an control also same amount of weights and did more trials
4435,2,2,the conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type b is able to stretch the farthest with 22m in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial two ways the student could have improved the experiment would to make sure that the amount of tape they put on the plastic was equal and how far they taped the plastic on the table
4436,2,3,the student could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results they could have done so by giving a measurement of how far the plastic will hang off from the table having the plasics at different lengths hanging from the table will cause error also she could say how heavy of weights will be hanging and for how long all of these factors affected the experiment
4437,2,3,this experiment concluded that plastic type a is the least stretchable land plastic type b the most stretchable plastic c is also not that stretchable and d is stretchable one way to add validity to the results is to make sure all of the weights are the same weight also that the original plastics are all the same length
4438,2,1,my conclusion is that plastic type b was the plastic that streched the most also in trial two t2 all the plastic streched more except for plastic type c the student could have improved by making his hypothesis clearer he also could of given us the names of the plastics
4439,2,3,plastic type b was stretched out the most the students could have improved the experimental design by calculating the two trials and making the total amount the plastics were stretched they also could have put down the length of the plastic befor they started streching
4440,2,2,based on the student's data plastic type b stretched the most out of all the polymer plastic the students could have improved the experiment by testing more specific in their procedure the length of the tapes should be the same for all the plastics as it was not mentioned the weight of the weights was not given as it does affect the result in the amount stretched the student could have also mentioned the name of the polymers to make the data table more specific and the experiment more useful to others
4441,2,2,a plastic type b stretched the farthest even though a c and d did not have very different results b stretched the most also plastic d remained constant both trials p b one way the student could have improved was to make more trials two trials can not give the best results also they could have lengthened the time and put heavier weights on the clamps
4442,2,1,a the results that were given showed that type a was the least stretchiest type c had the second least stretch type d was the second stretchiest and finally type d could stretch the most p the student could have improved this experiment is by showing how long they stretched the plastic till it broke and add a control to the experiment so they could compare the results to a regular stretched plastic
4443,2,3,a the conclusion of this experiment is that polymer b has the most stretchability while polymer a is the least stretchable p b the students could have improved there experiment version by stating the amount of weight used to stretch each polymer so if further study is needed the experiment can be replicated and to add more trials to confirm the data
4444,2,3,a plastic b has the greakest amant of stretchability surpassing the next stretchiest by 2 3 mm p b the students in order to improve validity must record the length of each sample prior to stretching to observe change also they should acknowledge the amount of weight used to stretch the plastics and never change it
4445,2,3,a the conclusion i'd draw from the student's data would be that plastic type b was the stretchiest p b to improve his experimental design the student could've specified how heavy the weights could be so that anyone replicating his work would know to improve his results validity he could have done more than 2 trials the more trials he did the more valid his results would be
4446,2,3,a plastic type a stretched the least and is therefore the most durable of the 4 types p b the students could improve the experimental design by determining a consistent starting area for all of plastics and they could improve the validity by doing more trials
4447,2,1,this student's data proves that plastic d had the greatest stretchability stretching 20 mm after 5 minutes the least stretchable type of plastic was plastic a which only stretched 10mm in the first trial and 12 mm in the second a way the student could have improved the experiment is they should have used a more firm material than tape such as stables or tieing it another way to improve is to allow the trials to each stand for 10 minutes to receive greater results
4448,2,3,my conclusion to this polymer investigate is that plastics type b has the most stretchability i think this because trial 1 and trials 2 both have the most stretchability some ways that the experiment could have been improved is by taking the i cader how much the weights and clamp weighed another way the the experiment could he improved is by telling the reader where the clamp was placed
4449,2,3,a plastic b was the stretched of all the polymeres plastic a was the strongest of all the polymers p b this person should have the exact length of the plastic he she also should have told the exact amount of weight to add to the clamp
4450,2,0,to my conclusion it looks like one second trial almost every plastic type stretched more than the first time because it was already stretened from the first trial also think the thanken and the plastic the less it stretened two ways to improve the experiment is time it longer to see the difference and use a different piece of plaste for each trial
4451,2,2,in conclusion plastic type b stretched out the longest in both trials and most of the others were far behind it two ways i would improve the design is to say how much weight i am adding at a time and attach two clamps on the bottom to even out the weight so it didn't rip through the middle
4452,2,2,a all plastics stretched but d making d the most durable plastic p b add more trials which would improve the data p instead of the weights being on for 5 minutes having them on for 10 would show long term effect p use the same clamp for for all plastics
4453,2,0,they could have used beacher holder and tape the plastic to the beaker holder and let it hold freely they could get more results for different trials
4454,2,2,the data shaved that plastic a stretched the most compared to the other plastics plastic a stretch 2mm plastic b stretch 1mm plastic c decreased 1mm in trial 2 and plastic d stayed the same two ways the student could have improved the experimental design validity of the results is to include the starting length of each plastic in the results to better understand how much each plastic stretched secondly for trial 2 i think the student should have added more weights and added a trial 3 with more weights for more results
4455,2,3,based on the student's data i can see that plastic type b had the most stretchability because both trials it stretched the most to make this more valid the student should have used the same length to start with for each plastic also they should include how many weights should be added and have much each weight weighs in order to keep it constant
4456,2,3,a plastic type b will sstrech the most while plastic a will strech the least b describe the initial lenht of each plastic and describe the amount of weight added to the clamp
4457,2,2,a conclusion that can be drawn from their data is that plastic type b has the most elastic compared to a c and d two ways the students could have improved the experiment and made it more valid would be to do another trial and let us know where each of the plastics start lengths were
4458,2,0,plastic a and b stretched cup c di stretched whe mm and plastic d stayed the same this experiment could be just proved by using be4tter plastic or living the weights in longer
4459,2,3,3 a they found that plastic type b has the exact stretchability because it stretched more than any of the other polymers p b the could improve the validity of the experiment by doing more trials they could included the size and wight of the wights which would in tus a improve the design or the experiment
4460,2,3,a plastic b stretched the most at av average at 22 5 mm plastic a only stretched an average of 11mm which is the least out of all of the plastics tested b one way the students could have improved their experiment would be to say how much weight they are pouring onto the clamp another thing they should have done would be to beep all of the plastics taped to a table at the same height it does not say they are all held at the same height in the procedure so we cannot assume they were
4461,2,3,base on the student's data plastic type b is the most stretchy and type a doesn't stretch as far p 2 ways the students could have improved was do a 3rd trial for more comparing results another way would be have the same amount of weights for each type
4462,2,2,a a conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is that the plastic a stretched less in each trial from any other plastic t it was 10 and t2 it was 12mm p b two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by first telling us how many weights c how heavy they should be the second way is by doing more trials
4463,2,3,in conclusion each one of the plastics are different types of plastic due to the understanding of the chart which clearly proves that each plastic is different due to the different amounts and lengths they were stretched the student could have improved the experiment by adding more test trials to see if the data is perfectly correct and by making sure the amount of weights added on the claps were equal
4464,2,1,the examples came out pretty accurate to the chart and procedure p but they needed to improve possibly by doing longer trials or adding how much weight if someone gave me this procedure i would not be able to perform it
4465,2,3,a conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that the plastic that can be stretched the most is type b and the one which can be stretched the least is type a the students could have improved this design by keeping or consistent sample size another way this experiment could have been more valid as if the weights on the plastic were also kept consistent
4466,2,2,a based on the data we found is that plastic b was the plastic that had stretched the most and plastic a stretched the least p b one way the student could have improved there experimental design is to be more exact on the amount of weight used alsocould of shortend the time
4467,2,1,as a result of our testing type b stretched the most out of all the other plastic type p one way the stretches could have improved there testing could be to
4468,2,3,a a conclusion cannot be made with the amount of data given the experiment doesn't show the starting size of each plastic same so the data given doesn't show how much each some stretched b to improve this experiment the students must record and keep constant the size of each plastic sample another way to improve the validity of this experiment is to record and keep constant the amount of weight added to each of the plastic samples
4469,2,3,a as you can see in my table that plastic b was the most stretched plastic and the none least stretched was plastic a p b i think the students could of told how much each weight really whey another thing was how far could each plastic go and how much space was the weight and plastic from each other
4470,2,0,one way they could of improved this experiment
4471,2,1,my conclusion is in the second trial t2 each plastic sample stretched longer than it did in the first trial t1 two ways the students could have improved the experiment is they should have told us how each longnt pound's did the nitach anlo the clamps instead of taking one sample of plastic take 3 or 4 samples
4472,2,2,based on the students data i can conclude that plastic a and b are both equally stretchy they both increased by one mm long i can also conclude that plastic d is not stretchy because through out both trails it stayed at 20mm one way the student could have improved the experiment would be to make all the plastics the same length at the beggining so the results are more valid and clear they also could have been specific about how much weight to be added another thing they could add is a controll
4473,2,0,the conclusion of this evestigation is that the plastic types did not stretch much type d didn't even phase b the kould have told us what kind of plastic did they use and what are you using to measure the plastic types
4474,2,1,a according to the data plastic type d is the strongest because it stretched 20 mm in both trials therefore it has the greatest stretchability p b the experiment could have been improved by ensuring that all the plastics one being clamped with the same amount of weights it would also be a good idea to use a control without the use of weights this way it would be easier to improve the end results with the control and variable
4475,2,0,the polymer plastics all had different results after each trial was tested plastic type a and b both had an increase in length after trial 2 plastic type c had a negative effect by going down a mm and d stayed the same the student could have used different time periods or even tested the durability of the plastic after it was tested
4476,2,3,plastic type b stretched the farthest p the student could have improved the experimental design by recording the exact weight to clamp they also could have put the measurements of the plastic before it was stretched
4477,2,3,the conclusion i can draw from the data is plastic b is the most stretchabety the data show in trial one it stretched to 22mm and trial two it stretched 23mm while d only stretched 20mm p two way the student could improve the experiment is do more trial and tell us how much weights to put on
4478,2,1,the student got different results he got a b lower higher and c d higher lower p two ways he could have improved his experimental design was by doing it over
4479,2,0,none of the plastic really seemed to move that well maybe except millimeters which in all reality isnt much
4480,2,2,a i conclude that plastic type b has the most ability to stretch because it stretched the most in both of the trials p b two ways the students could have improved on the experiment design and validity and to use a control and add more trials
4481,2,2,a the most stretchable plastic would be plastic type b p b first off the students have to make sure the plastics are all the same length to begin with second their data table should've shown what they started out with
4482,2,3,a plastic type b stretched the most then type d then type c and type a streched the least p b one way they could have improved would be making the weight constant the results would also be more valid if it was done a 3rd time
4483,2,2,plastic type b stretched the most and type a stretched the least i can conclude that plastic type b is the most stretchy because of the lack of information it is hard to to conclude anything two ways they could have improved would be to specify how long each plastic start as and what your measuring how much it stretched or how long it is total after being stretched
4484,2,0,in conclusion all the plastics bear up at one except plastic type d that stoped the same length they would of told the types of plastics they were using because most plastics react different with clamps or weigh on also give before descriptions on procedures
4485,2,0,plastic type 'a' and 'b' stretched more in the second trial as compared to 'c' which decreased by 1mm and 'd' which stayed the same p b maybe to show some difference the student could have used different weights or the same weight but left if on for different times
4486,2,0,i think the student the student should draw a conclusion based on the data he she has
4487,2,0,plastic type d stretched the furthest and plastic type a stretched the lowest the student could've listed the diffrent types of plastics used and explain the procedure better
4488,2,2,a the plastic type d has the most resistance out of the group and type a has the least amount p b the student should've measured before stretching is to make control then the students should've done the least one more trial
4489,2,2,a plastic type b stretched longer than type a c and d plastics p b two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to add make we4ight to the second trial and have tie plastic hang longer
4490,2,2,from the students data you can conclude that plastic type a the most stretchable you can conclude this because all other types had either1 mm length change or no change but type a had a change of 2 mm two ways the student could have improved would have been to have more trials for each type to make sure findings were acurate and to say the amount of weight added onto the plastic samples in his procedure
4491,2,2,the conclusion that i drew was that plastic type b stretched the furthest two ways that the students could of improve there experiment is that they could of did the experiment a third time or probaly let the weights hang on the plastic for more than 5 minutes
6809,3,1,as described in the article pandas eat an abundance of bamboo and therefore are specialist to china while the koala ''eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively '' both these animals are specialists to one habitat while the python a generalist is able to live in a wider range of habitats virtually anywhere
6812,3,1,pandas and koalas are similar because they both need a certain food that they eat such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves but a python will not eat anything but it needs in certain climate to be able to live there
6813,3,1,pandas in china and koalas in australia eat only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively according to the author for this reason they are both specialists however a the article states a python is a generalist and able to inhabit a number of different locations around the world unlike the panda and koala who are limited to their native countries
6814,3,1,pandas are similar to koalas because they are both specialists that must have special surroundings and certain things to eat pandas and koalas are different from pythons because a python can live almost anywhere with the help of the climate generalist which is a human being as stated in paragraph 20 achenbach 5
6815,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they both require specific plants for survival pandas need bamboo and koalas need eucalyptus leaves both animals are specialists achenbach par 21 they are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists and they tend to do the best in and around humans par 20
6816,3,1,pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves this animals are specialist pythons are generalist they can survive on almost any thing
6817,3,2,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they both eat one main food source pandas bamboo koalas eucalyptus leaves so they survive best in one stable non changing environment however pythons can live and adapt to new conditions so they can move to different environments such as asia to florida
6818,3,2,pandas in china almost exclusively eat bamboo making them a specialists species koalas in australia are also specialists because they almost exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves they are diffrent from pythons because pythons can live almost anywhere and can thrive on almost any food source
6820,3,0,panda bears are similar to koala bears because one they are both a type of bear and two they eat grass plants they are different then pythons because pythons are reptile and they eat things whole
6821,3,2,in the article the author tells us that china's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the australia's koala bear exclusiusvely eats eucalyptus leaves both animals really eat one thing a python is very different it doesnt eat one thing it swallows its meals there for its very different
6822,3,1,pandas and koalas are ''specialist'' meaning that they are not as abundant as generalists a python is a generalist according to the article a python can adapt more easily while a koala fore example ''eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively ''
6823,3,1,pandas koalas are similar to each other because they are specialists each only eating food that is specific to a custom area of tries globe but pythons are generalists they eat meat only require a certain climate for example a python swallowed an alligator that wouldn't happen in their homeland
6824,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because panda's only eat bamboo and koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves there and source is not every where they both cant just move from china or australia because there food is not made every where around the world
6825,3,1,panda in china are similar to koalas in australia because each one needs to stay their own habitat because they cannot live without the sources that their habitat give them they both are different from pythons caue python could addapt in any environment for example on the paragraph 21 the author give us a reason for why the pandas and koalas can't live in other environment
6826,3,1,china's panda and australia's koala are similar in that they basically only consume one type of plant each pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves these two animals are different from pythons because pythons eat other species
6827,3,1,pandas and koalas are both the same because they only eat certain things they are also both specialists they are different from pythons because they are specialists and pythons are generalists pythons have a variety of foods they eat while the pandas and koalas don't
6829,3,0,as you can see pandas in china are similar to koalas in austria because they are both specialist animals also the panda and koala are herbivores one eats bamboo and the other eats eucalyptus leaves in addition both the panda and koala are different from the pythons because they are specialist animals and they are carnivores meat eaters therefore pandas and koalas are actually different from pythons
6830,3,1,china's panda bears eats almost nothing but bamboo and australia's koala bears eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively these bears are different from pythons eat meat sources
6831,3,0,panda koala are similar because their both a specialist as a python is a generalist the article says a generalist is a raccoon a python a specialist is china's panda or australias's koala
6832,3,1,pandas in china and koalas in australia are alike because they both are plant eaters for example in paragraph 21 they say that a panda and koalas are specialist pandas and koalas are different than pythons because pythons are carnivor they eat alive things and as i said in paragraph 20 it says pythons are generalists
6833,3,2,chinese pandas and australian koalas are similar because they are both specialist species they only flourish and survive in a very specific area for example pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively however pythons are generalist species they can survive almost anywhere the article states that the species that have become most abundant are those that do best in and around humans
6834,3,2,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because both of them can only live off one food source they cannot live anywhere else because they need that specific thing found only in their enviorment pythons however can live off many things they can live in different enviorments and eat different rats thats how they live across the world
6835,3,1,how pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia is they both eat almost one thing all the time pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and how their both different from a python is that they don't eat anything when their hungery a python will eat what ever animal or human it can get
6837,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they eat basically one thing plants the python eats a lot of different kinds of animals and such
6839,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialist and they only eat plants and pythons eat mammals according to the article pandas almost only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively so that shown that they are nothing like pythons
6840,3,2,the chinese panda and australia's koala are both similar because they both eat special type of food they are both specialists according to the article both the chinese panda and the australian koala are different than python b c the python is a generalist that can adapt to different food scources
6841,3,1,pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they depend on what the environment brings them such as bamboo or eucalyptus leaves 'they depend on those sources to be there or they'll have trouble surviving however pythons are very different because they on there habitats such as were they live climate changes
6842,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they can both live off one plant bamboo and eucalyptus leaves they are both different from pythons because they don't pose any threats like pythons do you won't find a koala or a panda with a wood rat or an alligator in its mouth like you may a python
6844,3,1,pandas and koalas are quite similar in that both species have adapted immensly to their surroundings in that they would probably become hopeless if one was to be outside of their home and found to adapt elsewhere they are consicttenca specialists they differ from pythons in that pythons are generalists the ultimate generalist is arguably a human being can live anywhere that is kashy the orbility of a python
6845,3,1,pandas and koalas are both specialist they also both have exclusive diets the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala eats just eucalyptus leaves a python is a reptile and the panda and koalas are mammals the python is also carnivorous where as the panda and koala are omnivorous
6847,3,2,both koalas in australia and pandas in china or specialists specialist have a small range of diet china's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively are two great examples pythons on the other hand are generalists which means they have a greater variety of prey they are expected to survive better because they don't rely on one single prey
6852,3,0,pandas and koalas are similar because thier specialists species who need sertain things to servive they are not like the pythons because pythons are generalist who can servive in large areas
6854,3,1,panda's from china and koala bears from australia live off a restricted eating habit china's pandas strictly eat nothing but bamboo and koala only eats eucalyptus these types of animals are specialists a generalist was said that can live anywhere they adapt easy to there environment like pythons do
6856,3,1,the are of the specialists of panda's shows far that wich eats almost nothing but bamboo or australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively the reasons for that i think are causes they live they grow what they eat and specialy with what other animals they live
6857,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both a type of bear for one and they only eat one thing in the article they were compared because they only eat one type of food pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves they differ from python because pythons eat many different things also pythons are reptiles while bears are mammals
6859,3,1,pandas in china and koalas are similar because they both specialists they each eat on specific food and do well in a stable environment pythons are different from both the panda and the koala because they only are generalists they can survive in a number of environments and do best in and around humans
6861,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they both eat mainly one thing pandas eat mostly bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively unlike these animals snakes eat a variety of things snakes mostly eat other animals of living things
6863,3,1,pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they only eat one type of food which is bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas while pythons are able to eat many types of foods and adapt to other sources
6864,3,1,pandas in china and koalas in australia are both specialists which the article defines as anything that needs stability the article also says that a generalist is a raccoon a python a cockroach a white inland deer they are able to like humans live in man other places and thrive of a many different things
6866,3,1,pandas in china are animals that only eat bamboo and koalas in australia only eat eucalyptus leaves they are both similar because they both rely on 1 food source pythons eat all kinds of rodants and pandas and koala bears rely on 1 food source
6869,3,0,pandas from china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialist species a specalist is china's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or australia 's koalas bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exlusively they are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists
6870,3,1,pandas in china and koalas in australia are both specialists they can only survive in a stable environment as they survive on certain plants food live bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and needs certain climate pythons are generalists which can survive in a rapidly changing environment on multiple foods and climates according to the article a generalists can live anywhere from florida to antarctica or other species a specialist can be a panda eats almost nothing but bamboo
6871,3,2,as it says in paragraph 21 both the panda and koalas are specialists which means that they both need a certain thing to keep them alive pythons on the other hand need a varied climate to adapt quickly to add food sources this means generalists like pythons will throw out specialists because they evolve better
6873,3,0,china panda eat nothing but bamboo and australia's koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves
6875,3,2,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialists they only eat one kind of food which is only in the place that they are native to they both are different from a python because the python can eat any kind of animal o if they bad to survive in different places they could because they would have food there
6876,3,0,koalas in china are similar to koalas in australia because both of these animals are know in their country both theese animals have repulation in their country they are boith different from the python because pythons arn't know to be a specific country they are all over the world
6877,3,1,pandas and koalas are similar by the fact that they are categorical as generalists each animal are specifically affected to the food in their country such as the panda in china eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala eats exclusively eucalyptus leaves
6878,3,0,in the story one man's pet another's invasive species pandas in china eat almost nothing but bamboo or australias koala bears eat eucalyptus they both different because pandas and koalas are similar to a bear and pythons are snakes
6880,3,2,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialist and have mainly one food source pandas and koalas are different from pythons because unlike pandas and koalas pythons have a vast variety of food they can eat and they can live anywhere that has the similar climate as asia
6883,3,2,pandas in china are similar to pandas in australia because they are both specialists paragraph 21 states that both the species live off of are food bamboo and eucalyptus leaves they are different from the python because a python is a generalist which can adopt to anywhere pandas and koalas have to stay in the place to survive
6884,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialists and this age favors generalists like humans more they differ from pythons because pythons are generalists change favors generalists while stability favors specialists so we are favoring change which means generalists
6885,3,1,pandas in china are very alike to koalas in australia because each of these animals eat only one kind of plant pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves these two were also considered specialists in the article while the pythons were considered generalists for being in different a python for example could any thing it's way
6886,3,2,pandas are similar to koalas because they both only eat on food source pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus they are different from the python because if they were to move from there homeland they would survive on varieties of food but pandas and koalas can't do that
6887,3,1,pandas and koalas are alike in that they are both specialists because they eat only their on many food source panda eat mostly bamboo am koalas almost always eat eucalyptus leaves they differ from pythons because pythons can eat a wide variety of things from different habitats
6888,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia is because they both almost eat nothing but bamboo and eucalyptus but python is different from pandas and australia because it eats alligatar and swallowed
6889,3,2,pandas and koalas can only survive where the plants they eat are because they won't eat anything else pythons can live and thrive in other places because they eat a wide range of animals and survive in a larger climate environmental range pandas koalas are specialists while pythons and humans are generalists
6890,3,1,pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialist species china's panda eats nothing but eucalyptus leaves these species differ from pythons because pythons are generalists and according to the article can survive anywhere from california to delaware and including much of the south
6891,3,1,the pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia in the article it say they eat nothing but bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and they both are different from pythons because pythons eat meat and the pandas and koalas don't
6894,3,0,pandas in china eats bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves and both are found in trees both pandas and koalas are different from pythons because unlike pandas and koalas snakes can sometimes be found in tree and in the article it says a python ate an alligator
6896,3,1,pandas and koalas are the same type of animal because that spiecies stays in one are of the worl because thats the only place it will survive opposed to the pythons which is able to live anywhere and can adapt with hep from mabum day lan zology
6897,3,1,china's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively unlike pythons which eats everything in one where and leaves nothing of it left behind
6898,3,2,pandas are like koalas because the both only eat one thing both are also in trouble should their environment change rapidly they are different from a python because they aren't adaptive for example a python can be taken from asia and moved to america and adapt quickly an easily if the same was done to the panda or koala it would starve to death
6899,3,1,the panda bear is similar to the koala because they both eat only one type of food for a panda it's bamboo and for koala's its eucalyptus leaves they are different from pythons because a python eats animals and the bears eat vegitatian

9808,4,1,in the article invasive is significant because people are arguing if invasive species are bad biologist say invasive species are major threats to biodiversity bobroy macinnes thinks that the government overestimate the thrent pased by invasive reptiles
9810,4,1,invasive means that it comes and spreads and eventually takes over that is just what the python is doing to florida
9812,4,0,in my understanding invasive means wild scary or dangerous
9815,4,1,invasive is something that doesn't belong like a fox in a chicken coop that doesn't belong which could only means that fox invaded the chicken coop in the text it talks about snakes and reptiles from other countries these exotic species do not belong in america so they have invading homes in the native species as well as eating them
9816,4,1,the word invasive is an agatre that is used to describe something that is somewhere that it doesn't belong unlis disrupting what is meant to be there this word is important to the rest of the article because the article goes on to describe how snakes have invaded the everglodes in florida and have disturbed the article wildlife there
9817,4,1,the significance of the word invasive in the article is how the fact of it all is these animals from the passage like the python are very dangerous and invade or take over parts of were they live and kill anything that goes into there way or teritory and does that by cutting and eating
9818,4,0,''invasive'' is a word that was used to describe reptiles as used pets but researchers proved otherwise in the rest of the article ''i think that ''invasive'' is passing judgement'' means that the pythons and other reptiles are judged by kinds rather than overall actions and how people are afraid of pythons when they are relatively harmless
9820,4,1,the word invasive is used to describe creatures that are not native to a particular environment in this article it refers to reptiles particularlly pythons that have been released into the environment the invasive species are dangerous to the health of the environments they enter
9824,4,0,invasive means staying in one location but the species will show up in many different locations not just one
9826,4,1,the significance of the word invasive is that this article is talking about how snakes are starting to breed fast and are being invasive are invading a place they shouldn't be in
9829,4,0,the word ''invasive'' to this article is significant because it helps the reader reason that not all pets and reptiles belong to the climate they will die and become extincted if that occurs the others will die for some due to lack of food and resources provided by that newly extinct animal
9832,4,1,invasive is used in the title of this article to show how animals such as the pythons are invading new areas around the world and impose a threat to other species constantly throughout the article the author explains how harmful invasive species are to the environment if they are not normally there
9834,4,1,the significance of the word invasive is that through out the article it means spreading across the country but some some be think that the animals are introduced not invasive
9835,4,1,according to macinnes invasive is unfair because it passes judgement in the article it is argued whether or not invasive species should be allowed to be introduced to new areas
9837,4,0,the significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is that the article is describing on whether animals such as snakes and other reptiles are safe to have as people's pets or are putting people in danger if they encounter humans a quote from the article that helps describe my statement is that animals such as lizards and snakes tend at least in this culture to be less well respected or supported
9838,4,2,the word invasive is significant in the article to describe how people see these species it means that these animals are coming into our territory and are not welcomed macinnes says the use of the word is unfair i think that 'invasive' is passing judgement he does not agree with the term because it implies that these species are not habitat
9842,4,1,the significance of the word invasive is sharing the part of view that the species are not normal and are a bad thing macinnes says that even the term invasive species is unfair they're introduce' i think that 'invasive' is passing judgement item is one way of view that invasive is judgmental and negative towards these species while in article refleeds tiz article describes the dangerous that this species and could overpopulate and that negative is reflarted or calling the species invasive
9845,4,0,invasive played a significant role in this article invasive means to invade something in the text it says invasive a lot of times
9848,4,2,invasive is significance word in this article because it describe the pythons pythons in the wild are dangerous and have invaded different environment eating animals that are already almost extinct according to the article invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity invasive is one word that some of a point of view in this article

12774,5,0,mrna turns into sperm finding the uterus thus making more of its own kind but by sharing letters with the mate like mrna mates with std it become rstds
12775,5,1,it takes it into the cytoplasm wher the trna comes and joins to gether with it for a little whils then the trna leaves the trna matches up with the matches to the mrna and when they get together they make the protien that the body needs
12776,5,0,after mrna leaves the cell it moved and put together by trna then it becomes rrna and finally it turns into rna
12777,5,0,feeding absorbin the minerals getting the nutrients and passing them throughout the body
12778,5,0,mrna leaves the nucleus
12779,5,0,the four major steps in protein synthesis are 1 the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to where the protein synthesis is to be a code for protein 2 the proteins become synthesized by going through the code and recieve their code for an amino acid 3 the dna is being divided into seperate strands of dna 4 each strand of dna is coded and alike
12780,5,1,1 the mrna then goes into the ribosome to be transcripted 2 other pieces of rrna are attached to the ribosome 3 a specific enzyme is attached and starts to pair up the mrna with other rna to create a protein strip 4 when this process is done proteins have been formed and are ready to perform their jobs
12781,5,0,four major steps involved in protien synthesis is
12782,5,0,umm first it gos through the one thing then through the other thing then back through the one thing agian then finalllyit arrives in your body where it is needed
12783,5,2,the mrna finds a ribosome enters it connects with a anti codon to make the amino acids form a chain of amino acids
12784,5,0,trna will transfer it out
12785,5,0,the first step is to sherach the place where they want to benumber 2 they break in to the pieac number 3 finds where they whant to fightnumber 4 they could die
12786,5,0,the mrna takes the dna to the trna to be made into two new strands of dna which are made by two polymerease that go up and down the dna molecule producing new segments of ionic bonds to the original ionic bonds then they are taken to the rrna to become chromosomes
12787,5,0,interphase metaphase prophase anaphase
12788,5,0,1 is the interphase 2 is prophase 3 is metaphase 4 anophase
12789,5,1,first the mrna leaves the nucleus then it goes bettween a ribosome then it transcribes into rrna to create polypeptides amino acids that will serve out there duty to what they were made for
12790,5,1,rna travels through the endoplasmic reticulum and to a ribosome where codons translate the sequence of rna say taga to uaga

12801,5,0,it has to make it to the mitochondria then is goes to the membrane
12802,5,0,mrna leaves the nucleus trna transports the amino acidsrrns creates the proteins
12803,5,1,the mrna goes off to the rrna stage to deliever the message of what the rrna needs to code exactly the rrna then codes what the mrna said to code which of course then goes to the trna the trna then brings the rna strand to fuse with another rna strand thus the two strands become a dna strand
12804,5,2,first the mrna leaves the nucleus then the mrna travels and attaches itself to a ribosome the mrna then finds a codon that matches up with its correct codons when they meet they will form one section of dna the mrna continue this process until the full strand of dna is complete once complete the mrna will come to a stop codon meaning that the process of protein synthesis is complete
12805,5,0,1 mrna leaves the nucleus2 copy of the mrna is made3 chain the copies together4 goes to another nucleus
12806,5,1,in protein synthesis messenger rna leaves the nucleus and attaches onto a ribosome transfer rna gets the information from the messenger rna for the amino acid sequence transfer rna transfers the information to the ribosomal rna codons then start to attch to the mrna and form an amino acid sequence
12807,5,0,the mrna would then be transcribed by the trna during the process of replication this would then make the ribose rna which is sent the the golgi apparatus packagedm and sent out to the ribosomes in order to build that particular protein
12808,5,1,it goes through a pore meets with transfer rna connects with a ribosome and returns to the nucleus
12809,5,0,metaphase this splits the cellsanaphase this splits the cells into two telephase this completes the split of the cellsprophase it is the first step

12813,5,0,mrna will find another mrna then they will be moved to a protien and combined then they will be sent to their destinations
12814,5,0,starting with mrna the sequence then would start at its duplication of dna and then transfered into rna by transcription after the fact it would then go on with transolcation by converting it into mrna by then the mrna is doing replication by making more proteins and adding to the body
12815,5,0,1 is when it leaves it has to get use it being gone 2 is they have to work to regain it back 3 is when they are starting to regain it they have to store it 4 is when they get it stored they have to make sure there is enough for everything
12816,5,1,it goes to the ribosome to make new copys the trna copies the mrna then send it to wherever it needs to go

12832,5,0,first in protein synthesis the cells create prteins that regualt your tissues then it helps you build strong bones next it regulates the genetic material inside your body finall the cells help digest the proteins inside your body
12833,5,2,after the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels to a ribosome in the ribosome the rrna selects the opposite genes of the mrna the trna selects the anitcodons which are the opposite of the codons on the rrna then the trna synthesizes the genes sequences into amino acids and when the amino acids form together they create a protien
12834,5,1,the mrna strand enters a ribosome trna brings an anticodon to the ribosome that matches the codonthey form new amino acidsthey are connected and form new dna
12835,5,1,the mrna goes to the ribosome and puts the sequence onto the trna which then transcribes the sequence onto a type of rna that has different sequences of 3 that each have a different amino acids on them which form protiens when they are all linked together from the trna sequence

13158,5,0,mitocondriachromosomes ribosomeser
13159,5,1,the 4 major steps are mrna leaving the nucleus then gets moved over to the ribosomes then it gets put with the anticodons and the last part the proteins get formed into a chain type resulting in protein synthesis
13160,5,0,after the mrna leaves the nucleus it then shifts into trna which transports proteins across the cell after the proteins had been transported the process of rna is shown and it starts to build a rna molecule after the rna molecule is formed it then forms one side of a dna molecule then a dna molecule is formed
13161,5,0,mrna gets and amino acid from there the amino acid goes to trna and then is attached to nucleotides which froms a protein

15931,6,0,timpanic membrane
15932,6,1,lock and key only proteins that can fit into the lock are able to get into the cell they have protector protiens that only allow certain substances in one of them glycoprotein has a protector like a bouncer that blocks some of substances from entering and another one receptor protein only lets in ions and transfer proteins are ones that if they are small enough they can get through they also have substances inside the cell that fight off the bad substances that come in
15933,6,0,the cell uses a golgi apparatus to ship and move proteins across the cell ribosomes carry proteins the cell uses a endoplasmic reticulum to move the substances throughout the cell
15934,6,0,prophase metaphase and anaphase
15935,6,0,cytoplasm provides a liquid enviornment to make the transportation of substance in and out of the cell easier cell membrane has small holes in it like pores that limits different substances from entering the cell nucleus controls the instructions for each part of the cell so it gives the cell membrane basic instructions for what may come in and go out of the cell
15936,6,0,one process that the cell membrane does is mitoisis this is when the cell starts to make a copy of itself another is when miosis this is when the cells nucleus parts into 2 and starts to divide the final one is cell division this is when the cell divides and now there are 2 cells

15976,6,0,translation transcription mutation
15977,6,0,cells control movement of substances across the cell membrane by having 'gates' that decide weather the substance is wanted or not and lets it in if it's wanted or blocks it out if it's unwanted the cells
15978,6,1,one way of moving sustances is osmosis osmosis is the movement of water through a semi periable membrane osmosis takes no effort and disposes of excess water and keeps homeostasis another form of moving substances is passive diffusion which is making the enviornment inside and outside the cell equal this takes no effort and can move more than just water but other soultions as well lastly another way to move a substance is facilitated diffusion which is moving a substaince against the concentraition gradient this method of moving substances takes effort and is diposed of through a special protein
15979,6,0,the cell membrane is what controules the body it tells the body what to do and what to say

16322,6,0,1 having organelles they have specific organelles that perform specific fuctions to keep things organized and moving through out the cell 2 cell mrna cell mrna performs many tasks leaving the nucleus with messages that tell the rest of the cell what to do 3 cell respiration cell respiration helps to get rid of harmful substances and bring in important materials that the cell needs in order to survive
16323,6,0,crossing over mutation
16324,6,0,one type is diffusion this is where the cell absorbs nutrients through the cell wall transcription is another transcription is where the cell allows water to pass through the cell
16325,6,0,1 they have special receptors that only allow certain things to come into the cell 2 most cells contain a nucleus which is like a brain that controls what needs to be done the nucleus also controls the er which exports protiens so only the bad stuff gets transported out of the cell 3 cells have special enzymes that allow them to take in material that may be too big to fit into a receptor this allows them to take in important things that would not be allowed in otherwise
16326,6,0,absorption is when a substance is absorbed through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm ribosomes can carry substances through the cell membrance the cell membrane can envelope substances by cellular respiration thus bringing them into the cell
16327,6,0,1 the cell membrane lets things in and out 2 flagella3 trna
16328,6,0,the nucleus is one of the main parts in a cell
16329,6,0,carries things in and out keeps things that arnt needed out circulates
16330,6,0,1 prophase2 metaphase3 anaphase4 telephase5 interphase spends most of its life time in this phase till reproduction
16331,6,0,protiens moving around make the cell to move and the cell to function properly chloroplast helps things move swiftly around the cell to help keep the flow of everything and water going in and out of the cell to keep the cell hydrated
16332,6,0,three processes are anaphase metaphase and prophase these processes each control the movement of substances in different ways they stop what comes in and out of the cell control what goes across the cell and help determine when to break down the things inside the cell
16333,6,0,osmosis random particle movement and prot
16334,6,0,1 flagelium2 tacos3
16335,6,0,membrane membrane protein and through endocytosis
16336,6,0,the three processes to control the movemnet is rrna mrna and trna
16337,6,0,1 they use osmosis which is the movement of water around the membrane 2 they use the flagella which act like oars to move the cell 3 cells also use the cytoskeleton to control some of the movement
16338,6,1,1 the cell membrane is semipermiable so it only allows certain substances into the cell 2 there are protiens within the cell membrane which allows substances to enter or exit the cell
16339,6,0,the cell alows things to come in and out the cell
16340,6,0,the cell brings in nutreints through the cell membrane then the nutrients move across the golgi bodies and out the other side
16341,6,0,energy is stored and than released when necessary to obtain and give off energy for movement
16342,6,0,spores open up and force movement out of the membrane
16343,6,1,the three processes used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cells are diffusion osmosis and something else osmosis is the diffusion of water from high to low
16344,6,0,they send signals they control your body movement they make sure your body is working properly
16345,6,0,the cell's control center the nucleus tells the cell where things need to go the vacule controls what enters and leaves the cell

16351,6,0,interphasemetaphase prophase
16352,6,0,sodium potassium pump ion channel and lipid bilayer
16353,6,1,osmosis water is transfered through thte cell from less concentrated to more concentrated diffusion many substances are transfered to and from the cell through the cell membrane symbiosis
16354,6,0,of these three processes one is using pores on the membrane itself to transfer protiens another way is through absorbing the substances threw the membrane into the cell the last way is that the membrane allows the substance to enter the cell

18823,7,0,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with aunt kolab is that she still has growing up to do even though she has a lot of responsibility on her shoulders she is still young she still has a lot of learning ahead of her rose needs someone to talk to when she has a conflict in her life you can see this trait in the conversation with rose and aunt kolab
18824,7,2,rose is strong hearted and head strong she understands that her situations in life are difficult right now having to go to work make supper go to school and do homework but she keeps her head up and still believes that everything will get better in time she is optimistic about a lot of situations such as the conversation with her sister anna

18829,7,0,rose seems to be a really stressed out kid the passage supports that with many things but i think a really good example of it would be the conversation she had with her aunt
18830,7,0,she is worried about the responsibility she has to take on rose felt too young for so much responsibility
18831,7,2,i could use many words to describe this young cambodian girl named rose she's helpful caring smart gracious and very reseponsible but i believe that the word that suites her the most is mature rose is very mature she is handling her situation quite well she's not going around and complaining about how much she has on her plate she's trying her best to keep a positive view on things she works a four hour shift at a restaurant goes to school and still helps out with household chores like helping her aunt kolab prepare dinner she's a young adult and has a very high level of maturity for tackling all her tasks and being a strong role model for her younger sister anna thats why i would describe rose as mature
18832,7,2,caring 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother '
18833,7,0,rose seems to be held back by her family as she expressed to aunt kolab
18834,7,1,from the story you can tell that rose is a very heartwarming person she cares about her family and respects their different cultures that they may have rose was always a positive person even when her and her sister anna would get into it she would always stay positive
18835,7,2,caring rose said 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
18836,7,1,rose is a responsible young girl she is also hard working one detail from the story that supports this assumption is the following excerpt 'from school she'd gone straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework 'rose had a lot of responsibilities that she managed without becoming completely stressed out
18837,7,2,rose doesnt like to hurt peoples feeling you can tell because when her aunt asked if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help her family she knew how she felt she just didnt want to tell her aunt the truth because she didnt want her to be upset
18838,7,0,that you can do anything you want in your life
18839,7,0,rose is a very suddle or respectful person because she kept some of her feelings inside of her or didn't tell anyone how she felt fot a while and no matter what she was bound to keep working to keeep her family good doing whatever it took
18840,7,1,i can tell from this passage that rose is a very generous person throughout the entire passage she talks about how she is stressed out and under much pressure but she keeps doing it all to help paul get through college a very specific part to show this is at the very beginning whenever she wakes up from dozing off when trying to do her homework after that part she talks about why she is tired because she goes to school works and then has to help around her house and try to keep up with homework and she continues doing all those things to help someone else
18841,7,0,their conversations were good they always would talk about the good
18842,7,0,a trait that could describe rose based on her conversation with anna is frustrated i feel this way because sh is very upset about the family's situation and the amount of importance she is right now in their lives
18843,7,0,one trait that anna has is the need to please people anna has the type of personality that everything needs to be fixed and corrected by her for example she places alot of stress upon herself to fix the families issues but in the end all that occurs is a feeling of heavy weight is placed on her by her family paragraph 18

18846,7,2,in the story rose is the main character this main character displays kindness it can be easily noticed in the conversation that she has with aunt kolab when they are talking rose suppresses her feelings she is under the impression that she may offend her aunt so she does not mention how she really feels these traits show that rose tries to be kind even when she is under quite a lot of stress
18847,7,2,1 rose is selfless because she is willing to do something for her family that she does not want to do and she does not want to let aunt kolab know how she feels because she thinks it might hurt her aunt
18848,7,0,they lost one of there family members and they are upset about it and she keeps dreaming about it and all they want it to be happy and all they think about is that family member that passed away
18849,7,0,i think the trait that can be used to describe rose is she is busy with everything in school her job and helping with the house she wa stired from writing her essay
18850,7,1,she does a lot for her family she defends her father when anna says he has been gone too long she says they all have their own part to do to help their dad finish college she suggests to her aunt kolab that she feels 'weighed down' by what she is doing to help her family
18851,7,0,in the end rose is able to show her feelings and not keep them inside she is under a lot of stress and has a dream about paul weighing down on her body she confesses to her aunt that it is difficult for her to help the family out as much as she does after she talks with her aunt rose feels relieved and lighter
18852,7,0,rose could be described as protective in her conversation with anna she insincerely laughs after she states that money isn't everything 'only if you already have everything ' in order to hide the depth of the family's struggles as well as the weight upon her own shoulders from anna
18853,7,0,this story is discribing that rose is letting her work control her attitude when she talks to anna ignores her sister's bad dream
18854,7,2,considerate she didnt want to tell her aunt she felt weighed down by the family because she didn't want it to hurt her
18855,7,0,that she is denying what is right infront of her but she is willing to help and try to make it better
18856,7,2,one trait that rose has is that she is kind because in the story she askes anna when she walks in her room whats the matter
18857,7,0,rose seems to have her own opinion about evereything 'then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to colege
18858,7,0,rose is not resentful rose and anna are talking about their father's job and the money he is making there rose does not complain about her father's job in los angeles that is far away from the family while anna does
18859,7,1,worried rose is worried about what will happen to her brother and her sister she's worried about what will happen if her brother 'sinks'
18860,7,1,she is loyal but cannot live the way she is expected to at the beginning of the story she was upset that she had fallen asleep and failed one of her tasks this shows that she sincerely wanted to get the task done
18861,7,0,when rose was talking to anna she flet kind of like she was being amused then when anna glared at rose and said that money isn't eerything she was really upset when her gradfather went to los angeles for a job there
18862,7,0,a trait that can describe rose is that she holds a grudge on her brother she doesn't think that he will pay her and her family back for the college that he went to
18863,7,1,rose is caring towards anna when anna walked in rubbing her eyes wondering about their mom rose tried to make her feel better
18864,7,0,conflicted rose knows that she has to work at her job and make money to support paul at college yet she has her own dreams and she has an essay to write which she could win a prize for but she needs to keep working and to accept the prize you need to go to sacramento but if she does her boss will fire her and she wont be able to work for support
18865,7,0,a trait that rose has is she is put under a lot of pressure and is stressed easily with her family conflicts and juggling everything that is occuring in her life he aunt asks her 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose is timid and does not tell her the truth and this displays that she is stressed
18866,7,0,she is independent i say this because in the article she has to take care of her sister and she already has a job
18867,7,0,rose is a person who worries about her future my detail is that she is always worring about something in the future

18870,7,2,rose talked to anna in a sencer loving way ' anna ' rose said 'what's wrong you feel ok '
18871,7,0,a trait would be hoping for the better 'she tried a laugh that sounded even fake to her '
18872,7,0,when rose was talking to aunt kolab she did not speak it was almost as if she was scared or afraid to hurt her aunt's feelings she did feel almost exactly how her aunt was suggesting and she was to nervous to tell her when her aunt offered to help out more by making some special treats or sewing for ladies rose felt as if a heavy weight was taken off of her shoulders and she became less stressed
18873,7,0,she doesnt want to listen to what antone has to say about what they have to do to make ends meet in paragraph 11 rose is telling anna that they have to help paul finish colledge by workin and in paragraph 12 anna says u sound just like mamma and stormed out of the room
18874,7,1,rose is a character of many traits one that is revealed in her conversation with anna is her compassion for doing things they way they should be done she understands that paul is in college and needs help she also understands that when she gets in college she will also need help too her head is on straight and she can see reality instead of what she wants to see
18875,7,0,she think about other people than herself 'maybe we can find a way to do tings differently a better way for you '
18876,7,0,rose feels sorry for herself because he has so many things to do and to her her life isn't that great one detail from the story is that she asked ana what was wrong and when ana replied rose ignored what she had to say and started talking about herself and how she doesn't have time to get her essay done
18877,7,1,rose is caring yet she lets a lot of things get to her and she dwells on them but she also tries to make everything seem better for example 'it's only been four months ' 'he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here 'also when rose tried a laugh that even sounded fake to her
18878,7,2,rose is a respectful person she seems very busy with work and school but does not complain about it one detail from the story is that she did not want to hurt her aunt by telling her that she is feeling weighed down by helping the family
18879,7,1,rose is reliable she goes to school and then right after goes straight to work for four hours right after that she helps make dinner and gets her homework done not very many teens can do all that or are even willing to try it
18880,7,0,rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
18881,7,0,i think that one trait is that rose is always exhausted and in a grumpy mood
18882,7,0,a trait to describe her by is good i say this bcuase she wants to do things that help out he aunt
18883,7,1,i think that she is kind hearted because in the story she tells that she works her job to help out the family and pay for things
18884,7,2,one trait that can describe rose is when her younger sister walked in rubbing her eyes 'anna ' rose said 'what's wrong you feel okay ' that shows that rose cares about her and is very respectful
18885,7,2,rose is very stressed about helping her family for she feels overwhelmed but at the same time she doesn't want to tell her aunt kolab that she is feeling stressed because she knows that aunt kolab will most likely be hurt by the information this proves that rose is thoughtful of other people's feelings and caring even when she doesn't feel well herself
18886,7,2,rose is a careing person becuse she says 'whats rong you feel ok this tells that she cares for her sister becuse she could of not said eny thing and she wouldent know what her sisters thinking about
18887,7,2,she is caring because when her aunt kolab ask her questions about if she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help the family rose didn't want to answer because she didnt want to hurt her aunt or mother
18888,7,0,she needs an answer to her question and she wants her opinion
18889,7,0,one trait rose has is self absorbition in her talk with anna she takes in all of the pain that her dad isn't home and tries to keep it away from anna
18890,7,1,i think rose's trait is that she has a lot to do with the family she tries everything just to make the family happy she is kind of like the mother she has quite a bit of responsibility an example from the story would be when rose said 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper '
18891,7,1,one trait that can descibe rose is that she is hardworking the story says that she came home from school and went straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift and then straight home to help with supper she also had to do her homework rose was a hardworker and had dedication she had to have dedication to do school work and help out her family rose may have had to do all these things but she did her best at all them to help her family and to make a better life for her and her family
18892,7,0,rose is growing up too fast and having to take on responsibilities that she isn't used to she has to act like more of an adult than she really is so that her sister doesn't have to worry this is obvious when anna says 'you sound just like mama ' it shows that even if rose doesn't realize it she is becoming an adult
18893,7,2,one trait the identifies rose is that she has alot of fate in believe her family will hopefully come out of debt sometime and will not have to worry about money anymore an example would be when she says that their dad had to go to los angoles for a new job so he could get paid more money and some day return at the same time their brother is going to college and once his finishes and gets a good job their dad and brother will help pay them two to go off to college
18894,7,0,she loves money
18895,7,0,one trait that can describe rose is trust she trusts her aunt enough to come to her and tell her whats wrong and it ends up giving her motivational help
18896,7,2,rose is a strong induvidual because she does alot for her family and stays strong for them an example of this is in paragraph 11 sentences 2 and 3 'she tried a laugh and that even sounded fake to her ' we have our part to do to help paul finish college' this shows that rose is trying to stay strong for anna and her family by supporting paul
18897,7,2,the trait that i would give to rose during her conversation with anna is strength because rose is also upset about her father being away for four months but she decides not to get discouraged about it
18898,7,0,one trait that can describe rose is open minded rose spends the whole time stressing about her essay and what she is going to do to support her family in paragragh 23 rose became more open minded when she began talking to aunt kolab about things she could do to be helpful to the family
18899,7,1,rose is very responsible and she wants her family to stay together this is talked about in the story when she says that she needs to look at things through other peoples eyes also
18900,7,2,rose is caring towards her sister she gives her sister anna a logical explanation as to why their father moved for work rather than complain about how much she misses him too in a way she is trying to comfort her sister and tell her that it is for the greater good of the family
18901,7,2,she is caring she knows that paul needs to go to college to get a job so that he can pay them back but anne just thinks about it now although anne is right about money isn't everything
18902,7,0,that she is always worried about her school work and nothing else when anna told her thath she had a bad dream all rose did was change the subject about the essay
18903,7,2,rose is a caring person and this becomes evident when she askes anna if shes feeling okay after anna has had a bad dream
18904,7,1,helpful
18905,7,0,she wasn't very confident about what was gooing on with the essay and her dad
18906,7,0,she is shelfish she only thought about herself and money maybe we can find a way to do things diferently a way better for you
18907,7,2,hopeful ''we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ''
18908,7,0,i think that rose is sympathetic because when she was talking to her aunt kolab in the kitchen she doesn't come out and tell her aunt that she feels weighted down by what she does to help the family because she doesn't want to hurt her feelings
18909,7,2,rose is a very hard working young woman as her aunt had asked her 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' poor rose has had to work four hour shifts on top of going to school in order to support her brother through college so that in return he can work and support rose and her sister come time for them to go to college
18910,7,0,they both dont understand what rose is trying to say
18911,7,0,stressed in the 14th paragraph it says 'she felt too young for so much responsibility' as she cupped her hands together thinking about her life situation
18912,7,2,one trait that you could give rose is that she a hardworker because when she came to the essay and she didn't have anything to write about she didn't give up or put it off and not do the essay she continued to try to find a topic to write about
18913,7,2,rosa is very motherly when anna walks in the room rosa's first response is to ask 'what's wrong you feel okay ' this shows how she cares for her and her family
18914,7,0,after reading the text anna is presented as being tied down or feeling suffocated she shows this throughout but she shows it when she wonders to herself when she would squeeze that essay in paragraph 3 sentence 1
18915,7,0,she has too many emotions
18916,7,1,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with aunt kolab is that she is hardworking she is so hardworking that aunt kolab notices it aunt kolab says during their converstion that maybe they can find a way that is better for rose one that will take so much stress off of her this shows that she must work hard for the family to keep it running it shows that rose is very hardworking
18917,7,1,rose's trait displayed in the story is that she is a very hard worker especially for her family when she talks about her day is begins with 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then staight home to help aunt kelob prepare a quick supper
18918,7,1,rose is caring in the way that she does not want to trouble others with her own conflicts this is shown when rose doesn't answer aunt kolab when she says rose feels weighed down by trying help her family
18919,7,1,that she is responsible because she helps her sister anna with her bad dream even though she didn't appreciate it
18920,7,2,rose has a trait of protectiveness this is shown through her conversation with anna when she hides her emotions from anna this is an example of protectiveness because she is doing what is best for her by not showing that she is scared as well this will give anna a sense of comfort to think that someone is in control another example is when anna first walks in and the first thing rose does is ask if she is ok
18921,7,2,rose is a very kind person she asks how her sister feels and goes to her room to check on her
18922,7,1,rose is perseverent she doesn't give up she works a four hour shift after school and has to do homework too she knows that she has her families fate in her hands she knows that she can't give up
18923,7,0,an the athour is right money doesnt buy happynest
18924,7,1,she is extremely caring of others and does all she can for other people she also always puts herself last before others
18925,7,0,rose has a trait that makes her seem to herself as helpless this is a good trait because you can do more work when you have something that needs done although you do not know why you feel helpless and so you do something that needs done without you really even knowing you did it rose is talking to ana at the time that this trait exposes itself it says she tried a laugh taht sounded fake even to her this is trying to get her sister to no feel so bad about papa leaving to go to los angeles she is also trying to get her to know that it is their responsibility to support paul through college
18926,7,0,rose is very stressed because of this essay she just needed to take her mind off of the essay in the end she wasn't thinking about the essay and her aunt helped her firgure out title by not really even helping her
18927,7,2,rose is very determind but she is also being wighed down by other things like the essay she is doing to help her family she is very determind to get the essay done and help her family and her brother
18928,7,1,even though it doesn't say in the story but you can kind of get a hint that rose is older than anna but also younger than paul paul is away so rose has to step in and be the mature one and watch after her little sister she is mature because in the conversation with anna talking about her father rose is trying to soothe anna's thoughts about missing her dad
18929,7,0,if i had to use one trait to describe rose from this story i would say she is overwhelmed in this story i could tell by her conversations with anna and aunt kolab that she felt like she had too much resting on her shoulders for example when aunt kolab says ' this must be difficult for you yes ' and rose nods
18930,7,0,well rose is upset because of her essay and anna tries to confort her like any sister would and rose is angry
18931,7,0,rose has forgotten how to care for others by only looking towards the future and forgetting the present from being over worked in the persuit of raising money for her brother she has lost sight of her sister and how to care for her here in this passage she directly ignores her sister ' 'i'm fine ' her sister said 'i just had another bad dream ' 'i fell asleep working on my essay ' rose said' paragraph 7 line 1
18932,7,1,rose is hopeful that since her aunt sees it her way that her life will get better
18933,7,0,her distress defines her as a character she is worried about what will happen and is feeling great pressure from her family to succeed and to contribute to the family i drew this from her aunt's response to the dream when she said 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help the family ' a question she did not answer because the truth would hurt her aunt
18934,7,0,rose tried to anna can understand the real problem with their parents and she is trying to do her best to have a good family by her side but anna just dont get the situation for example rose told anna that her parents need to work more and that they have to appreciate the opportunity that they are having in their job and anna just dont get that thats a good opportunity for her family
18935,7,0,rose can be described by being stressed in the story it state that her brain became exhausted and is always busy moving from one activity to another
18936,7,0,i feel she is respectful because she listens patiently while the other person is speaking
18937,7,0,rose seems to always act like the mother in the house when her mother works late she goes to school has a job cooks supper for the family then she does homework
18938,7,0,in the passage rose is feeling weighed down by her family because she has to work and go to school just to be able for her family to live a some what normal life in her conversation with anna anna has a different view of the story because she is younger and doesnt have to work she doesnt see the unjust position that her older sister and he mother are in she doesnt understand why their father had to leave for a better paying job anna has a lot of resentment towards her family but she is continually trying to surpress her feelings in anna and rose's conversation 'anna glared at rose 'money isn't everything' 'only if you already have everything ' rose said she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her ' we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' this reveals that even though rose loves her family she resents that she has to help send her brother to school but she is putting on a brave face for her little sister and saying that even though they have to work hard it will all get better soon
18939,7,1,rose is composed she is breaking under the weight of her essay her job and all the stress in her life yet when anna comes in to talk about her nightmare rose is calm and collected 'i'm fine ' her sister said 'i just had another bad dream ' anna is distracting rose from spending much needed time on her essay with a mundane topic but rose still speaks gently to her with the compassion of a loving sister
18940,7,2,she is a very respectful person because rose didnt answer her aunt kolabs question because it would hurt her aunt since she feels so weighed down by helping out her family
18941,7,1,one trait that can describe rose is caring one detail from the story would be when she was thinking about the fate of two lives resting in paul's hands and one resting in her hands

18944,7,0,she is a worried person she thinks that she does not want to have the responsibility that paul had and she thinks that if she tells her aunt her aunt will be upset
18945,7,0,one trait that can describe rose is that she though feels extremely weighed down by her many responsibilites always puts the wellness of her family as a whole before her own well being this is shown during her conversation with her sister anna anna is complaining about their father being gone but rose argues that their father needed the far away job to help pay for paul's their older brother college education so that when he gets a job he will help to pay for their education
18946,7,2,rose is a hard worker who works to exhaustion as can be seen when she says 'i fell asleep working on my essay ' to anna

18952,7,0,one trait of rose is that she is a very generous person she spends all her time working so she can earn money to help her family
18953,7,0,that she was a person who didnt want to listen to anybody
18954,7,0,rose wishes to be successful an overachiever with life and education while talking to her sister rose says that her father went off for the better to make more money anna roses's sister is furious and explains that money is not everything in life rose disagrees and says that they have to help paul get through college then herself and anna she feels like she has to put the weight on her shoulders to benefit others she overachieves or tries to throughout the beginning of the story
18955,7,0,she tells her aunt everything and is very trustworthy but she feels guilty about what happened to her brother she had the bad dream about her brother but made herself feel better by talking to her aunt
18956,7,0,rose tries to do so much for everyone that she is to exhausted to do things she issupposed to do school work as rose says 'evenifidowin ' she thought 'i won't get to travel to sacramento to receive the prize '

18958,7,0,rose is scared and feels that she has to much responsebilty for her age in the story she has a dream of paul weighing down on her which would simbolize the the preasure she feels from having to do as much as she does
18959,7,0,rose feels stressed you can tell this by the way she is actin when her sister is trying to talk to her anna is trying to tell rose something and rose says that she sounds just like mama in an angry tone
18960,7,1,rose is an easy going person but she is also very stressed out because of all of the help that she is doing for the family so her brother can finish college rose has to work right after school and has no time for her school work
18961,7,2,rose always tried to do what was best for her family it was not until her dream about paul's body drowning her that she realized how stressed she really was as soon as her aunt suggested taking some of the weight off of rose and doing more to help rose instantly felt a little bit more relaxed and grateful towards her aunt
18962,7,0,rose sees others points threw their eyes not just hers it says in the story i realize thar you are seeing the situation throught through other eyes
18963,7,2,rose is encouraging she was having a very rough day when anna walked into the kitchen rose says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' despite her feelings she tried to encourage anna and keep their conversation postive
18964,7,2,'maybe her life would get easier maybe it wouldn't 'she seems undecided but she's willing to take things as they come she has a half positive outlook on things
18965,7,1,rose is caring because she is working herself until she is exhausted because she is trying to help out her family by helping pay for her older brother's college
18966,7,1,one trait that can describe rose is that she is caring of her family rose fits in school work and helping her aunt cook dinner each day even though she feels she has too much to handle she continues to do these things because she feels it is her responsibility to help her family in the conversation with her aunt kolab she admitted that she felt weighed down by everything she was doing her aunt then offered to sell treats from cambodia to lessen rose's responsibility leaving rose feeling lighter
18967,7,0,i think that rose is resentful of the fact that her family is not with her that paul needs the money their father is making while in los angeles that makes him have to be so far away from the rest of the family also that she feels that she has to help to bring paul into college
18968,7,0,rose is very jealous of her brother paul
18969,7,1,rose is very considerate of others and puts others before herself this was shown when she talked to both anna and aunt kolab when she talked to aunt kolab she realized that everything she was doing for paul and for the family was worth it she shows this when she says 'cambodian tradition and sense of family she realized could survive an ocean crossing '
18970,7,1,she is a hard worker she goes to school then straight to work then home to cook and finally does her homework which just so happens to be a 3000 word essay
18971,7,0,she is very stressed by the wieght she has on her shoulders

18973,7,0,rose is a type of person that doesn't give up eaisly and fights untill she gets it all worked out when her and her sister were fighting she kept arguing untill they came to a conclusion and they both felt they had won and walked away
18974,7,0,in the story rose is very mature she is trying to succeed in school help out around the house and blance a job although her situation isn't ideal she performs the same tasks everyday i noticed her maturity when her aunt asked is she felt weighed down by the family rose didn't reply because she didn't want to hurt her aunt this shows me that she not only understands the feeling of others but also understand her families situation at her age this shows maturity
18975,7,2,rose is very determined she does everything she can to help pay for her brother's college even though she is exhausted and stressed in the conversation between rose and anna in paragraph 11 rose says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college ' this statement shows that rose knows how important it is for her and her sister to stick through the hard times to get the money for her brother
18976,7,0,one trait that can describe rosa is talented talented descrides her dream and yet the fact that she came up with a story about her dream it was also creative she didn't just pick some idea and settle with it she put time and effort
18977,7,2,one of the traits that rose has is careing during the conversation with anna rose is asking her whats wrong and if she feels okay she cares about her and her family one other example would be when she is talkin to aunt kolab she doesnt want to tell her that its too much work for her to handle she doesnt want to upset them because she cares about how they feel
18978,7,1,rose is a dedicated person while she is talking to aunt kolab she figures out what topic she is going to write her essay about which shows her dedication to getting her work done rose is also proved to be dedicated by working on her essay until she falls asleep and keeps up with school and a job
18979,7,2,rose cares about how other people will feel if she really tells them how she feels for example when aunt kolab asks rose 'if she feels wieghed down by what she is doing for her family' rose's response is ' if i told the truth i would hurt my aunt and she might tell mother
18980,7,2,rose felt more hopeful after talking to her aunt the story tells us that her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter
18981,7,0,rose is very selfish
18982,7,0,rose is a strong individual because she hasn't seen her dad in four months plus she has to go to school then right after school she goes to work and after she gets off of work she has to do homework
18983,7,0,unsure is a trait i would use to describe rose one example is how she if fretting andunsure about the essay contest coming up and she's also unsure about her brother is what her dream showed
18984,7,0,'i hate how late she has to work'
18985,7,1,in the story aunt kolab asked if rose felt like the family is wieghing her down even though it was true she decided not to answer this makes me assume that rose is a very helpful and respectful person
18986,7,0,rose is a person that tried and do watever she can to help out her family like she works at a restuarant to help around the house rose's mother always have to work late
18987,7,0,one trait attributed to rose is a sense of hopelessness in the dream she puictures her self collapsing under the weight of her responsibilities and under her brother's
18988,7,0,she is very mature and you can tell because she can fell the stress from paul and knows her responsibilities
18989,7,0,she has always been so busy
18990,7,2,she has faith in everything she does and she cares about her sister i believe its because she tells her sister that everything will work out and that they will go to college like their brother
18991,7,0,rose hides how she really feels to both of the characters this is one trait that she has and she shows it by not saying what she really whats too
18992,7,0,one character trait that i can identify about rose is that she is not very outspoken due to her conversation with aunt kolab she seemed like she was scared to tell her aunt how she relly felt because she was afraid of hurting her aunt's and her mothers feelings
18993,7,0,rose is faithful she is faithful because she doesn't want to hurt anyone in her family she does what she is asked because she knows its the right thing to do in the story the aunt askes 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help thins family ' and rose didn't answer because the truth would hurt her aunt and she doesn't want to hurt anyone rose is a good person
18994,7,0,rose acts like she is resentful to her family when she lists all the struggles she went through with her normal day it sounds like she resents having to do what seems like all the work she goes to school then to work at a restraunt then she had to go home and work more to prepare dinner
18995,7,1,one trait that can describe rose is a presistance her school day was very long after school she went to work and did a long shift then came home and made supper and now she was trying to make a three thounsand word essay that takes someone who is a hard worker and who is persistant
18996,7,1,rose is very understanding in her attempt to calm anna down this trait is expressed by the way she trys to explain why papa is gone for example when anna started to bring up the fact that papa has bein gone for a while rose trys to help by saying 'its only been four months '
18997,7,1,rose is a heard worker like her dad her dad took a job in los angels he doesnt get to see his family much
18998,7,0,in the story rose seems to be overworked 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was tim to do homework '
18999,7,0,rose is obviously very confused she has a great burden to carry but is confused by what other people think of it
19000,7,2,rose is selfless when anna came into the kitchen to talk to her after her nightmare she started talking about how she misses papa and she wishes mama didn't have to work such late hours anna i'm sure felt the same way but she hid her feelings because she had to make anna feel better she had to put her little sister before herself
19001,7,2,rose respects and cares about how other people might thin before she speaks in the story she didnt want to tell her aunt something because she didnt want to hurt her feelings
19002,7,1,rose was a very hard working girl she felt really lonely because her dad had just left and her mother worked most of the day she said she felt too young for so much responsibility
19003,7,2,detuermined eshe said that they had to do their part to help paul get thru college then he will get a good job and he'll pay for them to go to college
19004,7,0,rose is always tired or busy because when rose was talking to anna rose said that she fell asleep or she could not get the essay done
19005,7,0,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with her sister anna would be she sounds like she wants to be in charge of her sister anna rose acts like a mother figure to anna one example from the passage would be when anna rolled her eyes and shoved the chair away from the table and said 'you sound just like mama'
19006,7,0,rose doesn't think she is all to great in the beginning she was having trouble writing an essay she then tells her sister how she fell asleep while writing it and thinks money is everything then later on she tells her aunt kolab of her dream and how much pressure is on her rose thinks she is the underdog in the family
19007,7,0,a trait to describe rose would be stressed aunt kolab said 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose didn't answer because if she told the truth it would hurt her aunt
19008,7,1,rose is mature we know this because when she talked to aunt kolab she does not want to hurt her aunt and therefore does not answer the question about if she feels weighed down
19009,7,0,based on rose's conversations with her aunt and her sister rose is very mature from the situation she has already been put in when rose comes in the kitchen to find her aunt she confesses that it is difficult
19010,7,1,she is a kind person but she is weighted down with all that is happening to her and her family she felt too young for so much responsibility
19011,7,1,she is very responsible she works at a restaurant and is a full time school student she took care of her little sister when she woke up from a bad dream
19012,7,0,rose has a charateristic of being very worrisome in the conversation with her aunt she thinks to herself if her life will get easier or not
19013,7,0,one trait is when rose said 'as gently as she could' one detail is when she woke up and came downstairs and her aunt said ' do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' and anna didn't reply
19014,7,1,one trait that could be used to describe her would be strong strength seems to fit her based on what she is trying to do for her family and trying to get a better education as well
19015,7,2,rose is generous she doesn't tell about how she really feels because she's concerned about everyone else it is shown in paragraph 18 aunt kolab says 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing for this family ' then in paragraph 19 when the narrator states 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt' this shows that rose is generous and concerned of the well being of others
19016,7,0,rose is very quiet when she was talking to aunt kolab she just kept nodding when she was talking to anna she kept changing the subject and suppressing how she really felt about the situation
19017,7,2,she is stressed and seems to be having trouble managing everything that needs to be done but she is willing to do it to help out her family in her converstation with anna she says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' this passage shows that she is aware of how hard it is now but all her work will pay off eventually
19018,7,0,i would say that rose is a sad girl who doesn't always know what to do and is trying to see if others would help with out makeings it worse on her or her family she feels like she is the one that is holding the family together
19019,7,1,rose is a responsible character in that she helps write an essay for her older brother and is still able to carry that weight with her she never once asked somebody else in the story to help her
19020,7,0,'you sound just like mama '
19021,7,1,that she worries much about her her father she tries to say as gently as she could in paragraph 14 it says 'paul's fate lies partly in these she thought she felt far too young for so much responsibiltity then she shivered imagining how her brother must feel only three years older he held the fate of two people both his sisters in his hands' so the trait would be that cares about people her family
19022,7,2,rose respects her aunt kolab and in paragrapg 19 she did't want to tell the truth and her aunt kolab's feelings in some way
19023,7,0,rose is sad she misses her dad very much
19024,7,1,one trait about anna based on this story is that she really wants to help her family but she's feeling very pressured she thinks that the fait of the family is all on her this is shown in the dream she has in paragraph 15 when she is being held underwater by her oblivious older brother
19025,7,0,when rose had woke up and ask anna was sh eok then she told her s he had fell asleep on her essay again
19026,7,0,rose is a very realistic person in the last paragraph from the story she opens up to her aunt a little to let her know how stressed out she is her aunt offers other alternatives to making money and this is good for rose although rose knows its a good opprotunity she does not get her hopes up because she knows that everything might not get better for her or her family this shows she is realistic because she has hope but she also knows the reality of the situation might not allow things to be improved
19027,7,0,rose is takes in to thougth to what her aunt said to change her thoughts that nothing would surely work out 'maybe her life would get easier maybe it wouldn't but her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter '
19028,7,1,rose is very senitive and really needs her sisters help 'you sound just like mama '
19029,7,0,rose keeo nodding maybe her life would get easier rose is always is busy and always forgets something she has to do until the last minute and trys to squeeze it into the day that is already as busy as can be
19030,7,1,rose is thoughtful from the conversation she had with her aunt she takes in her family she wanted the essay to be so good and didn't want her brother to look bad that it started to weight on her mentially
19031,7,1,she has a positive personality she says 'then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for yo and me to go to college '
19032,7,1,when rose was talking to anna she tried to be strong to give anna some hope that showed that she is sincere and it also shows that she is a strong individual that wants to help out if she can
19033,7,0,rose is stressed out she has too many things to do right now in her life she has to go to school then work a four hour shift then cook supper for her family and finally work on her essay she feels she is overworking herself so that her family is supported
19034,7,2,rose is very considerate of those around her she supresses her own feelings to make others feel better as shown in the following quote 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt ' rose does not tell her aunt what she is truly feeling so as not to upset nor disappoint her aunt
19035,7,1,rose is very responsible but needs a break or a little weight lifted she does what she is supposed to do
19036,7,2,rose appears very mature she attempts to make an explanation for her father when anna comes out to talk she also shows maturity when she chooses to talk about her problems with her aunt kolab
19037,7,0,one trait that descibes rose based on her conversation with anna is mature because she understand what is going on in her house with the money sitution she tries to explain to anna why her dad is gone for so long
19038,7,0,rose is a pesimist rose says 'even if i win i wont get to travel to sacramento' she also said ' if we had everything' refering to her dad working away from home
19039,7,2,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with her younger sister anna is that rose is optimistic one detail from the story that can support this is when she is explaining to anna that paul their brother will get a good job and pay for anna and rose to go to college rose is displaying her sense of optimism by talking about the good things that will happen in the future
19040,7,2,rose is very mature about her family problems the example in the would be when she tells anna 'he had to go the job in los angeles paide three times what he was making here ' she understands and still misses her father just as much as anna
19041,7,0,rose seems to have a sense of duty she says that 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college '
19042,7,0,from this story we can infer that rose is a worried person she is always worried about other people and trying to be the best she said she was worried about getting her essay done so she could win she wanted to be the best and actually win the contest then she was worried because she couldn't make it to sacremento to claim the prize if she did win she had taken too much time off and was on the verge of getting fired that made her worry even more because then she would be out of a job
19043,7,0,rose is very stressed out the story lets me know by saying 'she felt too young for so much responsibility'
19044,7,0,when she is talking to her sister and she does not respond to what anna had to say shows she is not that caring about what other people have to say she is more selfish
19045,7,0,that she is sometimes willin to listen but somethimes not but when she hears something she likes she gets incouraged she learns how to give and help others out
19046,7,2,rose is a very caring person who tries not to hurt anyone you know this by the way the author stated that she tried to tell anna as gentle as she could that their father had only been gone for four months she wants tobe free but rather she would want the happiness of her own family before hers since rose is a caring person maybe that is why she didn't wan to hurt her aunt's feelings when they were having a conversation
19047,7,0,rose seems very busy and she has no time to herself she said she didn't know when she would squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand word essay

19050,7,0,she is a good person she only wants the best for annna
19051,7,2,i think one trait that can describe rose would be how caring and unselfish she is in the story rose says with her hands cupped 'pauls fate lies partly in these ' she cares abut paul so that is why she tries so hard in everything she does
19052,7,1,rose is a hard worker she goes to work at the restaurant and still comes home to help cook supper after supper she does her homework she also is trying to win a three thousand word essay contest
19053,7,1,i think rose is a very caring person she cares about anna and her parents she realized that her dad had to go get that better job to support the family one detail from the story is that rose cares about her job and her family she believes her parents must work to provide for them
19054,7,1,rose is a very determined person because of what she does for her family despite all the stress from school and work she still finds time to write an essay for a competition outside of school she also exhibits determination in that she does not tell her younger sister about all her problems so she does not make her sister worry
19055,7,0,rose can't help remember her father sinking to the floor
19056,7,0,one trait that describes rose is confused one thing that supports this is that she doesnt know what she wants to do in life when she was talking to her aunt
19057,7,2,rose is very understanding she isn't stubborn about doing things that other american teenagers wouldn't ever have to do she understands that her family needs her help in supporting her brother sister and everyone else one detail from the story would be this 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college ' found in paragraph 11 line 2

19059,7,0,rose is a very optimistic person when she was talking to anna she was able to always look on the bright side of their situation anna was naming the bad things that are going on in their lives at the time and rose always said something optimistic
19060,7,1,rose is a very caring and understanding person but she feels as thought he familys weight on her is pushing her down her dream would be a good example of this and how it is affecting her
19061,7,0,rose sees the need to have money for the family while her sister would rather not have as much money and everyone be together and at home anna doesn't want their father to be in los angeles or their mother working so late rose however explains to her sister that the money is needed to be able to live and their brother to be able to get a college education that would let him get a good job the good job would then help bothe rose and anna go to college
19062,7,0,one trait that was about rose was that she wanted papa to go and just come back with the money it was all about the money untill she started talking to her sister and then had the dream that changed it all her perspective of the whole situation was totally different
19063,7,2,rose is understandig because she understood that her father went away for a better paying job
19064,7,2,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is that she is very caring of other people in paragraph 19 sentence 2 rose chooses not to answer aunt kolab's question if she tells her the truth rose knows that the statement will hurt her so she doesn't say it
19065,7,2,rose is responsible in here conversation with anna 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college ' she is helping her brother through college so she can then go to college too that shows a great deal of responsiblity

19070,7,1,rose seems to be a very caring person she tends to keep her pain bottled up in front of her younger sister anna she does this because she wants to instill hope in her baby sister rose knows that the situation the family is in is difficult for anna to handle being so young when anna and rose are talking in the kitchen anna mentions missing their father although rose misses her dad deeply she finds a way to justify him being gone again for anna's sake
19071,7,0,a trait that i think that rose has is commitment i think this because she goes to school works helps with dinner and still does her homework it takes a lot to do so much through out one day and her commitment to doing all of this is helping her and her family
19072,7,0,they have the same ataitod as each other like when the two sisters are fighting in the kitchen
19073,7,1,rose is determined when she talks to her little sister anna she feels that she needs to be brave for anna and not show her how she really feels so she won't worry anna
19074,7,2,she is caring in paragraph 5 she is conserned about her sister and ask her if she's feeling okay
19075,7,1,she worries about her father so i guess she cares deeply about people in paragraph 14 she says 'in the dark pose clasped then cupped her hands paul's fate les partly in these ' shes obviously worried about her father and in paragraph 8 shes worried about her mom having to work so late
19076,7,1,rose is very selfless your hear in the story about ll of the stress and anxiety in her life in order to help her brother go to college but she doen't complain to others when rose's aunt offers to help with the situtation and take some stress off of rose's shoulders rose doesn't show excitement for the relief of all her stress rose just politely nodds and thinks about how maybe her life will become easier
19077,7,1,rose is responsible and understanding she does everything she can to help her family and doesn't complain about how hard it is on her
19078,7,2,rose is sympathetic towards her family i know this because in rose's and her and aunt kolab's conversation rose didnt answer when her aunt asked 'do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' because she knows if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and her aunt would probably of told her mother
19079,7,0,rose got help from there aunt that means that she got help instead of not doing her essay her aunt told her that she should do the essay on the cambodian tradition and sense of family she also discovered that she could survive an ocean crossing

19085,7,1,a trait that can descrie rose based on her conversation with both anna and aunt kolab would have to be worried or frantic this is because she is worried about her essay and her family as well which builds a lot of pressure on her in the end she will eventually snap from all the unnesseccary pressures
19086,7,2,rose seems like the type of person who would worry to much but at the same time she likes to help people and she cares about other people too for example rose asks her sister if she was okay to see what was wrong with her
19087,7,0,she doesn't like to tell anyone how she is really feeling if it'll end up hurting them in paragraph 19 she shows how she thinks aunt kolab would react if she told how she really feels about helping with the family
19088,7,1,one trait that can describe rose would be hard working it says in the second paragragh that rose had gone to work strait from school works a four hour shift then goes straight home to do homework i would imagine that rose would be a very hard worker knowing that she has a job and she is smart in school and has the opportunity to send a letter in and get sent to sacramento just to recieve the prize so in my eyes rose is a very hard worker

19094,7,1,rose best character trait is she stays postive with other characters rose does'nt let other characters know how she really feel's because she would rather help them a strong example of this is when anna is upset about their father being gone rose explains to anna that he is geting valuable money so that they can go to college
19095,7,2,rose is a caring person that does not want to hurt anyone's feelings you can tell this because when she is talking to both her aunt and her sister she tries to down play her true feeling so neither person worries about her one example of this is when rose does not answer her aunt for fear of hurting her
19096,7,0,one trait of rose is that she wants to be like evryone else an example of when she acts this way is when she is talking to her sunt her aunt asks her if she resents her family because she has to help them out and if she doesn't understand why because she sees the situation through others eyes rose answers yes

19157,7,1,she is kind she tries to comfort her sister about their father
19158,7,0,aunt kolab was making noises coming from the kitchen they was sleeping
19159,7,0,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is that rose she miss being in combodia and it's difficult growing up where she is at now according to the story rose made her topic for her essay combodian tradition and sense of family could survive an ocean crossing
19160,7,0,she is very confused with her dad leaving to work in a different place her mom is never home and they never have any money
19161,7,2,rose is a very caring person during both her converstaions in the story she wants the other person to be alright she asks anne is she is okay and tries to see what's wrong with her in her converstion with aunt kolab she was afraid to answer truthfully because she didn't want to hur her aunt
19162,7,2,based upon the story it can be concluded that rose cares about other people's feelings in paragraph 19 rose does not allow her aunt to realize that she feels so greatly burdened by her responsiblities she believes that if her aunt were to know this fact she would be hurt and will also tell her mother who then would also be hurt
19163,7,0,rose supresses her feelings and keeps them bottled up her aunt asked her a question and she didnt answer because she knew she would get hurt if she answer she would have rather kept to herself
19164,7,2,i think one trait that would best describe rose would be had working in the story rose is so busy because she is trying to help her family as best as she can and starts to feel pressured by it rose does a lot she goes to work comes home help make dinner and does her homework i thinkg that shows that she is hardworking because most people crack and fail but she keeps doin because she wants to help her family and go to a good college
19165,7,2,rose is a understanding person rpse acknowledges that her dad has to be away so that her brother can go to coellege and get a good job rose understands that she is helping to put paul through coellege and he will help her and anna

19167,7,2,rose is hopeful she puts on a hopeful shield for her sister to show that everything is going to be okay even if she doesn't know it is rose tries to pretend everything is perfect and are only getting better because her brother paul will be there to support them soon
19168,7,0,rose want to help as much as she can but feels weighted because she is so young and has so much responsibility she confesses to this when her aunt calls her out on it
19169,7,1,based on the story rose character trait shows that she is a very responsible person rose has a big responsiblity on her hands and is determined to do everything she doesn't want to let anyone down because she doesn't want anyone to be disappointed in her rose has a big role to feel something like what her brother paul had to deal with rose didn't want to let aunt kolab down she didn't want her to be upset with her so she put her responsinblities last to put aunt kolab's first
19170,7,1,rose puts others before herself she does not skip work or not help with dinner to write her essay she does everything she can to help her family out
19171,7,1,one trait rose had in her conversation with aunt kolab is caring she is caring about trying to help her family
19172,7,2,rose looks at the positives in life and not the negatives in her conversation with aunt kolab she is thinking that maybe her life would get easier
19173,7,1,anna was only a high school student with alot on her mind she had the responsibility of an adult for an example she not only had to live her kid life by going to school and doing homework but she also had a job and had to take care of her little sister and also she helped prepare food all of that can cause a lot of stress which is why she was sleepy and day dreaming and which is also why she had that dream because drems do relate to what you'r feeling so therefore all of that made her stronger and also gave her something to write about in the end for her essay
19174,7,0,i think rose is stressed out because of how urgently she needs to tell aunt kolab about her dream
19175,7,1,rose lives poor she supports her family and feels like the world is caving in on her she cant handle the pursure anymore and don't want to tell anyone
19176,7,0,idk because i cant read jp
19177,7,0,rose is very outgoing she goes to school works cares for her family and still makes time for her school work she keeps her belief that if she can help her brother through college he will help her through school so she can live a better life than what she has at the time anna tells rose money isn't everything rose says differently that money isn't everything if you already have everything
19178,7,0,rose feels like everything that anna and she does relates to paul in some how in the story it says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
19179,7,0,she gets stressed over work greatly and she expresses this in her conversation with anna by saying 'i fell asleep working on my essay '
19180,7,1,rose is sincere about her family and would do anything for them but she is starting to feel the pressure of trying to follow paul's footsteps and be as successful as he is in the dark rose clasped then cupped her hands paul's fate lies partly in these she thought she felt too young for so much responsibility
19181,7,1,rose is caring and cares for her sister she tells her about her parents and brother and lets her know things will be fine
19182,7,0,she is mean
19183,7,0,well during the conversation of rose and aunt kolab i noticed that rose is confused about certain things when it comes to cambodia when they talk about looking at something in a different perspective i see rose not looking at in jer eyes but in everyone else's eyes 'in cambodia our first country what we're all doing would be quite normal ' her aunt said 'but now i realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes as you should i suppose because you grew up here this must be difficult for you yes '
19184,7,0,she feels like the weight of the world is on her shoulder
19185,7,0,anna thinks rose is to worried about the essay and rose thinks even if she wins she wont even get to travel to sacramento to recive the prize
19186,7,1,rose is determined and responible for many things in paragraph 2 it talks about how long rose's day is and what she has to do she has schooling and work but most of all shes respectful by going straight home to help her family
19187,7,0,rose sometimes suppresses her feelings from others 'only if you already have everything ' rose said 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' rose says this but leaves out how tired and horrible it really is for her
19188,7,1,from this story you can infer that rose has a strong sense of responsibility you can easily see this in her internal conflicts 'in the dark rose clasped then cupped her hands paul's fate lies partly in these she thought' this shows that she knows full well what is on her shoulders she knows the amount of work she must put in
19189,7,0,one trait that can describe rose is nervous because when rose was talking to her sister she was nervous to tell her sister about her feelings when rose was talking to her aunt she was nervous to tell her aunt how she felt because she thought she would mess up the family
19190,7,1,rose is a caring and polite person because she tiptoed into anna and her bed room so that she wouldn't wake anna up
19191,7,0,she is emotional and worries about everybody else 'in the dark rose clasped then cupped her hands paul's fate lies partly in these she thought '
19192,7,1,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with anna is that she is caring even though rose probably feels just as bad as anna does because their father is gone she hides and it does her best to comfort anna the line 'she tried a laugh that sounder fake even to her ' suggests that rose doesn't nesecarily believe everything she is saying she says it to make anna feel better though and that is why she is caring
19193,7,1,rose is a good kind hearted person who was trying to be positive for her sister when anna was mad about her dad leaving her mom being at work and the family having no money rose tried to lighten the mood and make her sister laugh even though she had stayed up late with the paper and was cranky she never took it out on anna
19194,7,1,one trait in this conversation would be understanding she talks about how her aunt could go sew for women this would make her not have to work so much
19195,7,2,rose is very caring for her family she helps out as much as she can and is exhausted and she doesnt want to let her family feel bad an example is when rose didnt want to tell her aunt that she feels weighed down because she knew it would hurt her feelings
19196,7,1,in this story rose seems to be very mature she tells anna that her father took the job in los angeles so that he could make more money to support the family in this rose pushes aside the emotional longing to see her father more often and states that he's doing whats best for the family
19197,7,2,rose is a very understanding girl she recognizes that some hard decisions are made for the best she knows that her father had to take the job in los angeles because it paid three times what he made originally
19198,7,2,rose looks at the bright side of things when her sister anna was talking about how she missed their father rose was the one saying that it was a good thing that he was gone because their family needs the money
19199,7,0,it seems like rose is an outgoing girl but doesnt have any confidents in herself it looks like she gives up to soon before she even try's like when she's talking to her sister and she says 'i'm so lonesome for papa it seems like he's been gone for years' well it just seems like she doesn't think she can do anymore until he comes back also if she writes the 300 word essay she has a chance to go to sacramento but then she says my boss is already mad at me and i would more likly get fired well right then is where she's giving up she could go to her boss and talk to him about it but instead she pretty much gives up
19200,7,2,rose is caring and hardworking in paragraph 11 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then hel'll get a job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to collage ' right their shows that rose is working at somthing and she cares about someone because she knows it will pay off in the long run
19201,7,2,one trait to describe rose would be understanding detail 'it's only been four months ' rose said as gently as she could 'he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here 'although she probably wants her father there like her sister she is understanding as to why he had to leave
19202,7,2,based on her conversations rose can be described as caring during her conversation with anna rose kept trying to sound postive and look on the bright side of things when anna talked about how long it seemed that their father had been gone rose tried to make it seem better by reminding anna that 'it's only been four months ' by doing this you can tell that rose cares about her sister's feelings
19203,7,2,one of rose's traits would be that she is hard working in the story she talks about how she goes to school then she works a 4 hour shift and after that she gets home and does her homework
19204,7,0,she's dishonoret to aunt kolab when she lied to her aunt because if she told the truth she would have hurt her aunt
19205,7,0,based on the conversation that rose had with aunt kolab the reader can see that rose feels overwhelmed by her job aunt kolab asks 'do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family ' rose doesn't answer because the answer is yes she does feel weighed down by her job but she doesn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings
19206,7,2,rose seems to be very understanding she's willing to do anything to help paul with college and doesn't second guess it when she's talking to anna she tells her 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college '
19207,7,1,i can infer that rose is more concerned about her little sister that she is about herself i can tell this because she seems to hide her true emotions when speaking to anna rose tells anna exactly 'it's only been four months he had to go the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here ' after this a few lines down anna tells rose 'you sond just like mama ' i am sure that rose has heard all that she said from her mother and was simply repeating it to anna to comfort her little sister
19208,7,0,blunt rose straight out explains to anna and aunt kolab how she feels
19209,7,0,one trait that describes rose is smart because her sister doesn't get that money is accually everything in this world rose knows that in order to survive money is needed

19212,7,2,rose is a caring person we see this when she talks to anna she asks anna what's wrong instead of going straight to herself falling asleep on her essay
19213,7,0,rose got the trait that she was just naturaly good at what she did for example she was always good at wrighting essays ever since she was a little kid
19214,7,1,when rose talks to anna she feels exhausted she is trying to help the family so much that she is unable to think strait rose can't think of anything to write for her essay and when she starts working on it she is distracted the first time anna had woke rose up because she had a bad dream then anna and rose talk about where their mom is
19215,7,0,one trait that can describe rose is that she is self centered and has a busy life and is always exhausted an example is when rose woke up and the rubbing her neck she remebered that she was thinking of a topic for her essay for the state competition when her brain got exhustated and fell asleep
19216,7,0,rose cares a lot about her family and helping her brother get through she tells her sister that they all have to do their part to help him
19217,7,0,rose seems to kinda hide what she's really thinking and feeling for example at the end of the story when her aunt was talking she kept nodding and didn't say what she was thinking
19218,7,0,she doesnt want to tell the truth if it is going to hurt someone rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to hel the family and rose said she didnt tell the truth because she knew it would hurt her aut
19219,7,0,she can be very kept to herself and doesn't like to wear everything out on everyone else her dream helps support this fact
19220,7,0,she was lonely and she did have a lot of bad dream which made her scared in reality

19224,7,0,rose does not like to make people feel bad she will not say anything or she will say something that makes you feel better rather than worse like when rose and anna talked rose told the things to anna as gently as she could
19225,7,0,confusedaunt kolab 'dou feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family'
19226,7,0,rose has a good mindset she knows her college will be paid for so she isn't upset about anything she knows how to plan her future
19227,7,2,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab is hope aunt kolab gave rose the feeling of hope by exploring other options that could benefit the family one detail that supports my answer is rose recognizing that her life would get easier if people search opportunities to help support their family
19228,7,0,rose is so exhaulted about writting her essay she keeps on falling asleep while trying to write it
19229,7,0,based on the conversations rose had with anna and aunt kolab you can tel that she is very soft spoken as well as shy during her first conversation she holds back what she is truly feeling inside then in the second conversation she simply nods agreeing with her aunt both of these help convey rose's shy and soft spoken personality trait
19230,7,0,she suppressed her feelings until she couldn't keep them inside her any more when she talked to anna she made everything sound fine but she really missed her father too
19231,7,0,in the story i feel like rose was a very realistic person i think this because when rose discussed the topic about their father not being around with anna rose knew he was gone for a reason to help his family and she knew that was how things had to be to support their family
19232,7,0,rose didnt answer because she new that tekking the truth would hurt her aunt
19233,7,2,considerate when she was talking to aunt kolab instead of telling her how she really felt she did not say anything because she knew it would hurt her aunt's feelings
19234,7,1,rose seems to be very hardworking this is used in the story because it says she on a regular day she goes to school and then has to work then she has to cook dinner and then do homework this shows that she is hard working and takes on a lot of responsibilities
19235,7,1,she is a careing person not wanting to upset any body
19236,7,1,rosa shows that she cares about her family by helping them in time of need rosa carries much responsibility including working a four hour shift every day to make extra money to suppose her family other than that rosa has other obligations as a student and child but set them aside so her family can rely on her
19237,7,2,she is worried about other peoples feelings when anna woke from a dream rose asked her what was wrong and poured her a glass of orange juice and when she was talking to her aunt she didnt want to hurt her feelings
19238,7,0,rose is worried that she won't get the essay done she states ' when would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thosand word essay ' this makes me think she's worried about getting it done
19239,7,2,she is a responsible girl based on the part where she is talking about helping her brother pay for college so that he can help when she goes to college
19240,7,0,rose is a very mature girl
19241,7,2,rose is a girl who really cares about her family and if something needs to be done she will do it in her conversation with aunt kolab aunt kolab asks if rose feels weighed down and because rose didnt want to hurt her aunt and felt like it was her job she did not tell her aunt the truth showing that she cares for her family and she will do what needs to be done
19242,7,0,rose is a respectfull being she is worried about how her sister anna is feeling when she walks in rubbing her eyes
19243,7,0,rose's character i believe can be summed up in a short few sentences between her and her sister anna in paragraph 10 sentence 2 anna states that in her opinion 'money isn't everything ' rose's feelings towards this statement are quite obvious with her response in paragraph 11 sentence 1 'only if you already have everything ' here we can interpret from her words that anna feels money especially in her family's case is quite important she feels that money usually is very important unless you have everything else in this sentence we can see a glimpse of how rose feels about the dependancy of money when it comes to the outcome of her and her sister's futures
19244,7,0,rose is confused you can see this when her aunt says 'this must be difficult for you '
19245,7,2,she doesnt like to hurt peoples feelings she vents to her sister and when her aunt comes home she she asks her whats wrong but she doesnt answer she doesnt want to hurt her aunts feelings in the story her aunt asks 'do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help this family' she doesnt answer she knows what she wants to say will hurt her aunts feelings
19246,7,0,rose is relyable when she tells anna that they have to help paul finish college
19247,7,0,during her conversation with her aunt kolab anna is very quiet and is not sure about what to say to her aunt about how she really feels aunt kolab tells rose to close her eyes and try to picture her own life through the eyes of another person who is dealing with a similar situation rose's aunt wants rose to realize that no matter how hard her life may seem at any time theres always going to be a little light at the end of the darkest tunnel that rose will face all aunt kolab want to do is find the easiest way to make anna feel better about her conflict she wants her to know that even if it seems hard to get passed there will always be a way to get around it
19248,7,0,she is a very busy person she hardly ever has time to do anything while shes at school working or helping her aunt with supper
19249,7,1,hardworkingfrom school shed gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework
19250,7,0,if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt rose did not want to hurt her aunt or her mother to find out so she did not answer her
19251,7,1,how she still has some hope left after all thats been done through out her life when she's talking to anna about thier father she knows things are bad but for her sister's sake she has to be strong and believe things will get better
19252,7,2,hopeful rose kept nodding maybe her life would get easier
19253,7,2,rose when speaking to aunt kolab shows a great deal of respect i know this because when her aunt asked her about being weighed down rose didn't want to say her real answer because it would hurt aunt kolab and her mothers feelings 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt ' as you can see in this qoute from the passage this supports my conclusion
19254,7,1,rose is like a mother always worrying and trying to act older than she should when rose and anna were talking about college 'and he'll pay for you and me to go to college 'anna said she 'sounded just like mama '
19255,7,2,well rose seems like a very hard working young women by having school a job and coming home to help her aunt make a quick supper also after all of that do her homework paragraph one
19256,7,0,rose trusts that her brother will graduate college and pay for rose and anna's college ' we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
19257,7,1,she cares for aunt kolab she doesnt want to tell the truth about how rose4 hurts because she feels like the weight of the family is on her she goes to school then she works a four hour shift at the restaurant and then helps aunt kolab fix dinner
19258,7,2,in rose's conversations with anna and aunt kolab rose comes off as selfless is not worrying about herself but about her brother and putting him through college so she and her sister can go to college but at the same time she is trying to comfort her sister and assure her that everything that the family is for the best it is for anna and rose's future this is shown when anna and rose are speaking of how their parents are working so hard they hardly get to spend time with their family but rose tells her sister 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college ' this passage shows how rose is selfless comforting her sister even when she is drowing under the pressure she is under so her family has a better future
19259,7,2,one trait that can descrive rose based on her conversations with anna or aunt kolab is that she thinks about other peoples feelings one example from the story that supports that she thinks about other peoples feeling is when she is talking to her aunt kolab in paragraph 19 when she said 'if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt '
19260,7,2,in her conversation with anna rose can be described as being a maternal figure for anna rose tries to calm anna after her bad dream and not tell her how she really feels about the situation their family was in
19261,7,2,a trait that describes rose is she cares about her family and their feelings a detail from the story that supports my answer is when anna is talking with her aunt she does not want to tell her aunt the truth because she is afraid it will hurt her feelings
19262,7,1,rose is supportive of her famliy because she see the job that her dad took in los angeles as an opportunity for more money to support the family she says that her dad did the right thing during her conversation with anna
19263,7,1,rose is very dedicated to her family she works hard and gets all her school work done in order to support her brother while he is going to college
19264,7,0,she's a dreamer she had a dream
19265,7,2,rose is a very caring person she cares for her family dearly she only wants what's best for her family rose unlike anna understands that you have to make sacrifices for a better life so though it might be hard now it will later be better for her and her family
19266,7,2,i think that rose is very giving and wants to help her brother and her family but is stressed about it i also think she realizes it will get better and in the end she will have help from everyone in her family just as they are helping her brother like she said to her sister 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college then he'll find a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
19267,7,0,rose is very sentimental she takes on the role of being anna's mom when their real mom isn't there after rose realizes that anna is very upset whie walking in to the room rose immediatly asks anna what is wrong and tries to comfort her
19268,7,1,responsable she told her sister that they had to do what they were doing so there brother could graduate collage and help them get to collage
19269,7,0,exausted i think this is a great trait to decribe anna because she is exausted with having to work and go to school in order to support her family in the best way she can one example from the passage is when she has her is talking to her aunt kolab and she asks her if she feels wieghted down she doesn't reply to try not to make her aunt feel disappointed with her
19270,7,2,she is caring she asks her sister what is wrong and if she is feeling okay
19271,7,1,one trait that can describe rose would be that she is determined rose goes to school regularly and also has a job she also helps around at home with whatever needs to be done rose does not give up on things that are important to her or her family even when things are difficult and she does not feel like she has enough time to finish she still puts all her effort into getting the job done she feels over worked at times and occasionally has doubts but she works through them and continues on
19272,7,1,she is feels very responsible because it shows to everyone in the family
19273,7,0,rose tell her aunt how busy and stress she is rose tell how her problem relates to her dream
19274,7,1,she is a very hard working girl in the story it states that sh goes to school from school she goes straight to work from work she comes home and makes supper for the family and barley has time for school work
19275,7,0,rose's conversation with anna shows that she will not give up at anything it also shows that she has way to many things to do in a day she also shows that she truely does care about others but she juse doesn't know how to show it
19276,7,1,she worries for her family she pours anna orange juice and comforts her with how her fater is responsible with paul going to college when paul got a job he would soon be responsible to send his sisters off to college
19277,7,0,one trait that i believe describes rose is lonely i believe she is lonely because no one understands the way she is feeling for example when anna and rose were talking anna didn't care about what rose was telling her anna rolled her eyes and left the room
19278,7,2,she trys to help other people out however she can she shows this because she is helping paul finish college
19279,7,0,'i fell asleep working on my essay ' rose said i think this means that rose is a busy person and tries to push herself to do many things in her day and gets tired often
19280,7,0,rose is a conflicted character she feels weighed down by all she has to do to help her family and herself she has to help pay for her brothers education and has to work on her education too 'in the dark rose clasped her hands paul's fate lies partly in these she thought '
19281,7,0,anna cares about her family very much her sister and her don't always get along but they will try to work things out it said that she rolled her eyes pushed her chair away from the table stoodup and stalked out of the kitchen is a good way to explain that they don'talways get along
19282,7,1,rose cares about her family she sees her sister and the first words out of her mouth are 'anna what's wrong you feel okay '
19283,7,0,rose is an outgoing person even though anna is upset that her father had to leave and her mother is working late rose tries to make it seem better by saying that their fathers pay is being tripled
19284,7,2,one trait that can describe anna would be motivation anna has a lot of motivation to help her family she doesn't want to see her family struggle so she does everything she can to help out like earning money by working at a restaurant a detail form the story that supports my answer would be when she says 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college '
19285,7,1,i believe rose is very grateful about things in her life even though she feels stressed and pressured to make it easier for everyone else she doesn't tell her aunt kolab she knows it's kind of her job to be that way it definately shows when her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down and it says 'rose didn't answer if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
19286,7,0,she was scared to tell her ant the truth so she asked her a question instead of just coming out with what she needed to say so i can say that she is lonesome or does not trust any one with her feelings it shows this in paragragh 19
19287,7,1,rose is a hard working girl she gets up to go to school and when school gets out she goes to work and works a four hour shift then goes home to help aunt kolab fix a quick supper then shes off to do her homework rose trys her hardest at everything she does to help her family
19288,7,2,in the story rose stated 'i'm insane ' in paragraph 3 the impression that i get from her is that she is overwhelmed with things it seems as if she is in a hopeless state of mind people expect her to do her best and she believes that people think too highly of her but towards the end of the story her emotions change when her and her aunt are having a conversation in paragraph 23 it states 'maybe her life will get better ' now she is in a hopeful state of mind rose seems to be the type of person that is easily influenced and let's things get to her at times
19289,7,0,rose seems to be an encourager you can tell this by how she tries to encouraged her little sister even though she felt discouraged herself
19290,7,2,rose is hopeful rose said 'then he'll get a good job anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college '
19291,7,0,rose is a realist who does not hold onto dreams she believes that nothing is easy and she knows the truth for example when rose and anna are discussing their father and his taking a job far away rose explains he had no other choice that his job was the best decision for the family
19292,7,2,according to the text one trait of anna's would be that she really cares about her family it goes to show in the text the conversation between rose and aunt kolab rose feels weighed down by the family because her dad departed to los angeles to take a job and her mother always works late in rose's dream of her brother jumping in the water on top of her showed that she is too worried to relax aunt kolab even asks rose if she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help her family and rose doesn't answer but she know thats how she feels
19293,7,2,one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna and aunt kolab is that she is caring doesn't want to make anybody feel bad because of her struggles she wants to comfort everybody and make them feel as good as she possibly can a supporting detail of this is when she aunt kolab asked her if she felt weighed down by all of the work she had to do and she wouldn't answer because she didn't want to make her aunt feel bad

19301,7,1,one trait that describes rose is that she is a hard worker a detail that supports this is the line that says 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework '
19302,7,2,rose is a very caring person she thinks of others first and is willing to do anything to help her family when rose retells her dream to aunt kolab her aunt questions if rose feels pressure to support her family however before rose answered truthfully rose thought of her family's feelings and decided to hide her true thoughts in order to spare her family from disappointment based on these details it is obvious rose is a loving person who puts her family first
19303,7,2,rose caring person or sempatheticrose tryed to help out anna and she just got mad and left
19304,7,1,rose is a very hard working young lady and the reason i say that is because she's going to school working to help out with the family go home and help make supper with her aunt and then do her homework rose is really trying to make it through school but she is having a hard time because of the trials and tribulations she's goin through at home and school

19317,7,1,rose is a very caring person she trys to comfort anna in their conversation

21759,8,2,paul realizes that he could give mr leonard something that he couldn't have as a college athlete he realized that he could make something of himself with all the help he is recieving by coaching or teaching help

21770,8,1,the narrator is shocked about what he finds and wonders why mr leonard didn't tell him about his great achievement the hole reason why mr leonard wanted the narrator to look at his background information was so that he could see that not only talent can get you through life he wanted the narrator to see that you also need an education for example he says 'i was a good athelete but not a good student '
21771,8,0,the affect that paul has on the background information about mr leonard is that when he told paul he lost his scholarship he had flunked out 'no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read ' that was what mr leonard had told paul also when he got stopped in the hallway mr leonard asked him where he was going and he looked at the pass but didn't know if paul was telling the truth paul found out at that point he didn't know how to read
21772,8,2,it effects paul because he has been training with a person who broke track records in college it made paul want to work hard

21779,8,1,paul realizes that mr leonard and himself are alot alike paul said that the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to him the feeling of paul's embarrassment when he was called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know and answer everyone else knew was just like what mr leonard had felt
21780,8,2,the background information on of mr leonard has encouraged paul to do well i think he feels that if he can get good at track he can do anything he sets his mind to at first paul was suprised and honored to know that mr leonard had went to college for track and after he finds out he cant read he feels sorry for him but at the same time he can relate to his story
21781,8,1,when paul gets backgroung information on mr leonard he has a new respect for mr leonard that he didn't have before when he first finds out about leonards past he isn't angry for not recieving the truth but paul is eager to help mr leonard achieve his obstacles in return for helping him achieve his own obstacles

21783,8,2,paul is in awe of mr leonard when he sees that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that he broke records he is kind of confused as to why mr leonard stopped doing track until mr leonard tells him it was because of his poor reading skill
21784,8,0,mr leonard stops everyone on the stairwell he wants to help paul fine a sport that he can play mr leonard whats paul to play track and now he is tranning mr leonard dont know how to read so paul helps him
21785,8,0,mr leonard is a good techer he helps his stoodints out all the time he tooke his time out of his day to help this kid that needs help on his home work
21786,8,2,paul wonders why mr leonard didn't tell him about his past it surprised him that mr leonard was a bad reader just like he was the information makes paul want to help mr leonard just like he had helped him before
21787,8,2,the effect on paul after reading the background information on mr leonard was shocking he couldnt believe that he used to do hurdles he was concerned and interested in knowing about his experience and what happened as he questioned mr leonard he asked him what happened after that and mr leonard explained how he was in the same situation as paul but back then they didn't have a learning center people told him that he would get a scholarship and not to worry about his grades so he just got by from his friends helping him which eventually didn't work for colllege because it's way harder he ended up flunking out and no other school wanted him paul felt that since mr leonard was helping him that he would help mr leonard so as the story ends he is going to help mr leonard learn how to read
21788,8,1,the background information which paul discovers about mr leonard definately has an effect on paul's feelings for his new coach unlike before paul now feels a connection with mr leonard in that they each have gone through similar struggles by being able to relate to one another's strengths and weaknesses their relationship will surely change in a positive manner
21789,8,0,paul had this stuff happen to him to so he's trying to fix it and do better then mr leonard also he is learning to be good in sports aswell also he want s to make mr leonard to be happy
21790,8,2,with this information paul gets he kind of in a way makes a new friend and learns that mr leonard was a track star but can't read like himself these two people relate together because they both can't read to well
21791,8,1,paul is more intrested in track and ask mr leonard if he should start working out with the high school team paul and mr leonard both have the same learning problem the only differnce is that paul can get help and mr leonard couldn't
21792,8,2,the effect that background information has on paul was he felt encouraged about learning how to read becuase when mr leonard told him that 'my grades didn't matter that i'd have tutors to help me but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked out no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read
21793,8,2,the effect that it has on paul is astonishment and confusion at first he doesnt understand a why a famous trck star is a hall monitor at a highschool and b why a track star choose him and is teaching him how to do hurdles
21794,8,2,by learning the background information about mr leonard i believe it encourages paul more when paul asks mr leonard about what happened after all of that and he tells him about him not being able to read it makes paul appreciate the work that mr leonard is doing for him more with knowing this paul also feels more comfortable with talking to and befriending mr leonard because he knows that they both understand on another
21795,8,2,the effect that the background information about mr leonard has on paul is substantial paul is suprised and impressed by mr leonard's acheivements when paul found out why mr leonard flunked out of college it reminded him of his own struggles like when paul says 'i knew them well feelings of embarrassment ' paul was touched and motivated by his findings and decided to help mr leonard
21796,8,2,paul realizes just how much he and mr leonard have in common when he questions why mr leonard did not tell him he is not looking for a specific answer perhaps he already knew the answer and wanted to confirm his suspicions he really just wants to understand mr leonard he then decides that he is going to help mr leonard learn to read because they are more alike than different and he wants to do something for mr leonard to express his gratitude
21797,8,0,paul sees that mr leonard was a good and that he even broke recods n the 400meter hurdles but mr leonard told him he could not read he did not go pro mr leonard is try to tell him to keep reading cause without it you cant do a lot of thing
21798,8,0,once paul discovers that mr leonard was a track star paul is interested in mr leonards acomplishments this is seen in paragraphs 35 44 when paul questions mr leonard about his college life and why he didn't go on to be great
21799,8,2,paul was shock he didnt not mr leonard a hall moniter was fast on the tracks by broking records paul and mr leonard was the same they both could barely read but they good atlehtics so paul wanted to teach mr leonard how to read since he helped him in trainin to become a track runner
21800,8,0,it makes him thinck about whats going on and how he can go to the learning center and get help
21801,8,1,mr leonard motivated paul saought that track was for him and not basket paul became good at it because mr leonard took time to train him and helped paul exel in something and paul was motivated to return the favor so called in paragraph 45 and 46
21802,8,1,when paul discovers that mr leonard had the same problems he does he decides in paragraph 45 that he is going to help mr leonard he says to himself 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something ' he wants to return the favor and so he takes mr leonard to the learning center so as to improve his reading skills
21803,8,2,it had a motivating effect on paul mr leonared's time in college help paul realize that grades do matter and even if he was good at hurdles you have to have a good education as well this would help paul feel more like he needs to learn to read for he could be something great just like his coach he realized that mr leonard wanted to help him to be great at hurdles and have a reason to want to excel in his education 'c'mon mr leonard ' i said walking back toward school 'it's time to start your training '
21804,8,2,'visit this site do a search for 'grabowski'' this line shows that mr leonard was special but the narrator was about to find out what was special 'i was a good athlete ' he said softly 'but not a good student' this line was made the narrator realize that they had a lot in common
21805,8,2,the effect that getting this information about mr leonard has on paul is this feeling of obligation to help his friend this is shown at the end of the story when paul says ' c'mon mr leonard it's time for your training ' in this case training meant that he was going to help him to read
21806,8,2,paul and mr leonard have a reading problem and they both are talented hurdlers this brings these two together into a close relationship when paul learns about mr leonard's reading problem this makes paul want to help mr leonard like mr leonard has helped paul
21807,8,1,it inspires him to do better in the academic area so if he goes into college for track he wont flunk out
21808,8,2,the discovery of the records that mr leonard broke effected paul because he was shocked that mr leonard didn't tell him about it and made him believe that he could accomplish almost anything because him and mr leonard shared the same emotions and feelings an example from the article would be 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me '

21848,8,2,paul finds out that mr leonard was a great runner but because he wasn't able to read he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college this knowledge gives paul the motivation to not only work to become a better athlete but also to work hard in school

21854,8,0,paul thinks he has done wrong in his life
21855,8,2,during the story the reader gets background information about mr leonard and it had a certain effect on paul mr leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals mr leonard had been teaching paul how to run and jump hurdles knowing his own background paul might have been a bit suspicious at first due to mr leonard not telling him about his past however when going into detail about his past mr leonard exposed his embarassing secret he couldn't read so he flunked out of college after this story of mr leonard's life paul emphasized with him knowing that mr leonard had a problem reading and couldn't get help back when he was in school gave paul an idea 'c'mon mr leonard ' i said walking back toward school 'it's time to start your training ' paul is going to help mr leonard after mr leonard helped him they helped each other in this story because they seen a bit of themselves in the other mr leonard knew that paul couldn't read so he helped him learn how to jump hurdles knowing that could symbolize facing the problem head on and jumping over it passing paul realizes that mr leonard couldn't read and so he helped him they bonded over their experiences
21856,8,2,paul feels as if he and mr leonard are in the same boat they both have a hard time reading and are good at running hurdles paul wants to help mr leonard with reading while mr leonard helps him with running hurdles
21857,8,1,paul was disappointed at first that mr leonard didn't tell him about his past hurdles experience however after talking with mr leonard he understands completely what he had went through and how hard it was for mr leonard to keep up in school paul knew all too well about that paul shows sympathy and understanding and decides to do something for mr leonard by helping him train with hurdles again it also instills motivation in paul to learn to read and do well in school so that he may one day go to college and do both hurdles and schoolwork
21858,8,1,the background information wasa conection between the two because the both hav a harder time with school
21859,8,0,the backround infomation tells paul that mr leonard is good at the sport and he wants him to succeed the backround infomation also tells paul that mr leomard needs help with something because he is shy about why he stopped track when paul found out that he could not read paul took him down to remedation
21860,8,0,cause you should alwways do a background check
21861,8,2,the background information paul got about mr leonard effects him when paul researched him he found out he won the 400 meter paul wanted to know what happened and mr leonard told him he got kicked out of high school because he could'nt read and paul knows how that feels mr leonard wants paul to succeed an make it like he didn't
21862,8,2,he realizes that mr leonard knows how he feels he was the same way it also shows him that he can do things just like hurdling you have to overcome them i also think that paul will continue to learn his reading and help mr leonard too
21863,8,0,paul finds out from the track coach that mr leonard was once a national champion in college he then confronts mr leonard about it and gets the whole story mr leonard confesses that he was a bad student and ended up flunking out of college this helps paul realize that even though he's good at hurdles he needs to stay on top of his school work
21864,8,2,the background information about mr leonard effected paul in many ways paul realized that mr leonard was a lot like him mr leonard could not read either when he was about his age and he looked at paul as himself and chose to not let the same thing happen to paul
21865,8,1,it relates paul to mr leonard and he understands why he wanted to help him
21866,8,2,when paul finds the background information about mr leonard he becomes more confident about his not being able to read and about running hurdles in track mr leonard explains how he was the best runner at his college and that he broke records but he could not read so he flunked out of college mr leonard felt sympathy for paul when he first stopped him in the hallway because they were in the same situation because they have this in common and because mr leonard helps paul paul wants to help him at his faults 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him ' paul helps out mr leonard by helping him learn how to read in exchange for mr leonard teaching paul how to run and jump hurdles
21867,8,2,paul was shocked that mr leonard was a track star and was curious why he didnt tell him paul asked mr leanard why he didn't continue when mr leonard told him that his grades weren't great then paul felt more motivated
21868,8,0,it shows him what might happen if he does not try to push himself in his academics
21869,8,1,he diden't know about it he was shocked but he asked him about it
21870,8,2,'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records ' that right there would automatically influence me paul may not have been a very good reader but he sure did want to make mr leonard proud so he joined the track team
21871,8,2,at first paul did not really know why mr leonard was doing this and paul only did it because he was use to doing what mr leonard had told him then when mr leonard finally breaks down and tells paul what happened to him and all his story paul feels like he should bejust like mr leonard only difference is that paul will be able to read and do studies then paul will be able to get into college and actually get and education and do track at the same time paul felt bad for mr leonard and ecided to be like him and do wehat he says because now that he knows that mr leonard was a track star and that he was really good means that paul will believe in mr leonard more and do everthing that he says even though he already listened to ehat he said usually it will just make him feel more comforting around him
21872,8,0,paul is a little confused by the fact that mr leonard had never told him of his past and he had wondered why he had not told him when mr leonard tells him why he had failed out of college and then paul returns the help mr leonard gave him by teaching him how to read
21873,8,1,the effect the background information has on paul is that he feels more connected with mr leonard
21874,8,1,he is surprised that he had not known how famous mr leonard had been and confused as to why he had not told him mr leonard's story had a strong affect on paul because it was very similar to his
21875,8,2,when paul discovered the background information it made him realize what a priveldge it was that he was able to be trained by him also it gave him confidence to go work out with the high school track team by knowing that the man who trained him broke national records he was given confidence pertaining to his own skills
21876,8,0,the effect that it had was question the reson for that is he wondered why mr leonard didnt tell him about it
21877,8,0,i think that all the background history that paul finds out about mr lenoard is a big change for him and that he needs to learn more about him to feel comfortable to play the sport that he is being trained in and that mr lenoard is feeling bad because he didn't let paul know ahead of time what type of background he had
21878,8,0,he was very exited about finding out that he was being coached by somebody who all of these great things
21879,8,0,paul goes to get help to learn how to read mr leonard tells paul that he can't read very well
21880,8,1,paul has kind of the same thing going on in his life after he finds out about mr leonards background he wants to help him
21881,8,2,when he got the background information on paul he was shocked that he failed out of collage but he didnt want to say anything to harm him in anyway for failing they both helped each other threw there hard times
21882,8,1,the effect that it has on paul is that he wants to help mr leonard out since he helped paul out
21883,8,2,the background information effects paul in many ways paul realizes that mr leonard is a great man and paul saw that mr leonard helped him achieve something and he wants to do the same paul takes mr leonard's college past life and realizes he is better then that and helps him learn to read
21884,8,2,this effects paul in a good way it's almost like mr leonard's story inspires paul he was impressed the quote from the article 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records ' makes it sound as though paul is indeed impressed paul is concerned what happened to mr leonard's career in running 'well what happened after that ' this quote is an example of his concern as soon as mr leonard explains to paul that he could not read paul was in shock 'but you went to college ' he couldn't believe mr leonard could not read either
21885,8,2,it effects paul because paul has trouble reading and realizes that him and mr leonard have this in common he also may have realized that just because he is bad at reading doesn't mean he can't be good at other things
21886,8,2,when paul found out about him in track he sounded confused and wanted to know why he stopped running then when he found out it sounded to me that he was disapointed because he didnt finish school but he was understanding and wanted to help him by teaching how to read and to be smarter
21887,8,2,in the story the reader gets background information about mr lenard the information that paul discovers effects him in a very positive way he finds out that with practice and hard work you can do anything that you set your mind to with the experiences that mr lenard went through paul can learn from the mistakes that he made and he can be more sucessful mr lenard wants paul to not drop out of college and also be a sucessful track runner mr lenard wants the best for paul and his only intentions is to make him more sucessful
21888,8,1,paul was upset because mr leonard never told him he went to college and broke the record the background effected paul because he did not know what he could do for mr leonard he does now because he can start to train him as he did for paul
21889,8,0,the effect of the background information has on paul is that mr leonard was once him before not knowing how to read but was a good athlete so he trained him to become good in track so he returned the favor and did something for him
21890,8,1,learning the information about mr leonard is so that paul can have a deeper understanding of why he is being instructed to do the running
21891,8,2,paul does research on leonard and finds out all that stuff about how he ran the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke all these records what it did was not only suprise him but it also inspired him because mr leonard couldn't read either so just because paul can't read doesn't mean he still can't succeed
21892,8,1,the effect that the background information paul got from mr leonard shocked him it shocked him because paul would have thought that because mr loenard was a exellent track runner he would have went and graduated from college
21893,8,0,he is puzzled he wants to know what happened to mr leonard after he broke the records he asked 'well what happened after that '
21894,8,1,the background information that pual found on mr leonard made him even work harder the reason why because mr leonard was a great track star back when he was in college and it made him wanna be track star
21895,8,0,the narrator started looking up to mr leonard because he was going through the same learning disablity he was fighting the narator noticed that mr leonard could not read very well when mr leonard asked his name when he checks his hall pass twice a week
21896,8,2,after mr leonard told paul his story about college and his low skill on education paul realized that mr leonards words and speech were all too familiar to him paul knew how mr leonard felt about his feelings and embaressment when he had to read out loud
21897,8,2,paul can really relate to mr leonard after he learns about his history and finds out that he could not read very well when he was a kid paul also is very impressed with the achievemnets that mr leonard achieved when he was in college pau realizes that he can help mr leonard by teaching him to read just like mr leonard taught paul to jump hurdles i think that the similarity in each one of the characters pasts will help them to become closer together and form a good friendship with each other
21898,8,1,pual is suprized that mr leonard was a kid is track also that he made it to calloge running track for them pual was also surprized he won the 400 as a freshman
21899,8,2,paul feels sorry for him and wants to help at the end of the story he starts walking back to the school to teach mr leonard how to read paul could also relate to him since he had been bad at sports and mr leonard was bad at reading
21900,8,1,the background information that paul gets on mr leonard during the story inspires paul to help mr leonard 'train' or read when paul finds out that mr leonard can't read he follows by saying 'c'mon mr leonard ' i said walking back toward the school 'it's time to start your training '
21901,8,2,the back ground information that paul finds out is that when mr leonard was a college freshman he had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and he had broken records paul also found out that mr leonard had flunke out of college and lost his scholarship because he couldnt read the effect that this information has on paul is that it shows him that although you can't read or have learning disabilities that doesn't stop you from achieveing big goals in life the mistakes mr leonard had made influenced paul to want to strive for what he wanted it made him stronger inside
21902,8,1,this background information surprised paul he thought that mr leonard was just a hall monitor that kept students moving along to class when he found out about mr leonard's past he felt sort of a connection with him in paragraph 45 paul said that he knew how mr leonard felt because he was going through the same thing
21903,8,0,the backround information makes paul a better student because he asks for help with the learning center
21904,8,1,it makes paul curious to why mr leonard never told him he use to be a hurdler since he's teaching paul to hurdle the after leonard tells him his story then paul relates to it and find they are alike
21905,8,1,the effect that the background information has on paul is that paul could understand mr leonard's point of view on things he went to the learning center as well as paul he told paul that he was a good athlete but had to work hard in high school to get good grades mr leonard felt emabarrassed telling paul but paul could tell the sadness because it was all too familiar to him paul wanted to help mr leonard just like mr leonard helped paul so that's just what he did
21906,8,2,mr leonard's story effects paul because paul is a poor reader himself and just found out that a teacher couldnt stay in college because he couldnt read either and realizes that without the learning center he could have ended up just like mr leonard it teaches him to be grateful for what he has
21907,8,1,that he is not all that different form paul he wants him to learn how to read so he can excel in other things in life
21908,8,1,the effect that the background information about mr leonard has on paul is that it encourages him to help mr leonard as mr leonard has helped him paul relates to mr leonard's embarassment with his reading difficulty and wishes to help mr leonard improve his reading as mr leonard has already helped him improve athletically
21909,8,0,it reminds him how he has his problem with being an acedemic star but a terrible athlete because mr leonard was a star athelete but an academic failure he knows how that embarassing feeling feels being good at one thing but an embarassment to the other
21910,8,1,when paul learns about mr leonard's past he's wonders why he didn't tell anybody paul asks him what happened and then he feels more connected to him
21911,8,1,after learning about the background information the coach told paul to look up i could imagine he was feeling mixed emotions at first when paul adresses leonard for the first time he is hesitant and confused because he wasnt sure why leonard would keep this from him however once leonard and paul talked about it briefly paul's emotions switched from confused to astounded by how leonard the hall monitor broke records in the 400 meter hurdles as a freshman
21912,8,0,paul is excited knowing that mr leonard was a top athlete who did so many amazing things like braking records at a college level
21913,8,1,it dosent have that much effect on him he is surprised that he had a past like his
21914,8,0,he learned that mr leonard was really good at track and feild during high school he wanted to know why he stopped mr leonard didn't want to tell paul about it so he wouldn't give up 'i pulled the printout i'd downloaded the night before from my pocket 'why didn't you tell me about this '' 35 he wanted paul to do the best he could and not get worried about messing up
21915,8,2,the background information that paul learns about mr leonard forces paul to see the concequences of not knowing how to read the background does this by explaining how my leonards inability to read made him flunk out of college which he then lost his scholarship that he had for a sport he truly acceled at it also touches paul in a way that makes him see that pushing himself will always end up beneificial in the end
21916,8,0,the effect the background infromation has on paul is that mr leonard had reading problems as a child and he turned to track and became very good at it and thinks that track could also help paul out a lot in life too
21917,8,1,paul just thought mr leonard was a hall monitor but when paul found out about what mr leonard used to be and how mr leonard couldn't read just like paul and that made paul feel happy that mr leonard helped him excel at something and let him know it's okay to not be able to read but keep working hard so you can stay in college
21918,8,1,it teaches paul an important lesson that working hard in school is imortant it tells him that if you are not properly educated then you will be held back from doing what you want to do in the future when the coach tells the kid he flunked out of college this tells paul the importance of knowledge
21919,8,1,paul knew how mr leonard felt he is the same way in school he felt embarrassed when he was asked to read or answer a question that he didnt know the answer to so paul felt like he should help mr leonard sience mr leonard helped him
21920,8,1,i think it effected paul in a inspiring way when paul found out he look at mr leonard in a different way paul knew where mr leonard was coming from
21921,8,2,paul was surprised because mr leonard did not tell him anything about himself for example the fact that leonard couldn't read
21922,8,2,paul learns that mr leonard is similar to him in most ways he learns that the mr leonard cannot read just like him and that mr leonard was also an impressive athelete as paul is training for the track team he learns more about mr leonard he learns that mr leonard was a record breaking athlete on a college track team but that the record break didn't matter because he was a poor student paul could empathize because he too needs assistance with reading
21923,8,1,paul feels a sort of an connection with mr leonard and also gains a feeling that he isnt alone in is struggle i say this because paul isn't going to let mr leonard go with out starting his training
21924,8,2,the background information that paul gets on mr leonard is that mr leonard could also not read in school he finds out that mr leonard broke track records in college he then also finds out that he eventually flunked out of college because of his inability to read all of this encourges paul to try harder in school and also in track
21925,8,2,the background informtion that paul finds is important because when paul asks mr leonard about it he finds out that mr leonard wasn't a very good student either this makes paul feel like he connects to mr leonard now paul is going to help mr leonard learn how to read which will only further their relationship
21926,8,2,paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star his freshman year in college but mr leonard tells him that he was a good athelete but that he couldnt read so he lost his scholarship and flunked out paul understands where mr leonard is coming from because he couldnt read either
21927,8,2,the background information that paul finds about mr leonard effects the way he looks at his mentor mr leonard has taught paul how to hurdle for awhile now paul cannot read so mr leonard is trying to make paul feel better about himself through an athletic accomplishment paul goes to the high school coach who gives him a website which has information about mr leonard that paul has never seen before he discovers on this website that mr leonard was a great hurdler a track and field star when paul confronts him about it mr leonard says he flunked out of college because he could not read paul does not lose any admiration for his mentor however he instead emphathizes with mr leonard and begins to teach him to read the information helped paul further understand his friend
21928,8,2,it effects paul in a way that makes him feel that he was in the same situation as mr leonard they both can't read and they both are hurdlers paul is effected also in a way that makes him want mr leonard to be able to do the same things as him in the way that mr leonard wants paul to hurrdle paul wants mr leonard to be able to read
21929,8,0,the information that paul gets is recieved in small bits and pieces not until he researches mr leonard does he find out that he was a college track star who set records in college finding out these things really helped paul in many diferent areas finding out that mr leonard couldn't read was a big part of that
21930,8,2,the boy knows that mr leonard was once a very famous track star but yet he also failed in school when paul finds this out he is motivated to help mr leonard read
21931,8,0,paul didn't understand why mr leonard didn't tell him about his records or achivments in college until mr leonard told him about his life and how he was not very good at reading
21932,8,0,he gets background information of mr leonard that he put his mind to the test and if he doesnt do what he says he gets mad until he does what he is supposed to be doing all that the teacher wants him to do is to be a better person and to learn how to do other things then just learn how to read when he still has along time to worry about how to read
21933,8,0,paul feels as if he should get on the team for the school and do good for mr leonard because mr leonard gave him lessons on how to do it also paul feels as if he wins it will make mr leonard feel accomplished and very proud
21934,8,2,in the story paul learns of mr leonard's past when he learns of how he lost his scholarship due to reading problems paul feels empathy for mr leonard because he is experiencing the same problem in the area of school but instead of just feeling sorry for the illiterate janitor paul decides to return the favor by teaching mr leonard how to read when he tells him 'it's time to start your training '
21935,8,0,paul learns that hard work can help him get to go to college paul is glad that he knew the tutors could help him
21936,8,1,hearing about leonards background motivates paul to do better
21937,8,1,the background information on mr leonard has on paul is paul is going though the same situation as mr leonard thats why he relates to him to much
21938,8,2,the fact that paul finds out who mr leonard really was had him confused wny he never tole him but also inspired him when mr leonard tells his story of not being able to read and not finishing college
21939,8,0,the effect that the background information had on paul was nothing it was to just to try to scare him but it didn't work mr leonard was a very good and nice teacher
21940,8,2,during the story paul fines out that mr leonard was a famous track star the effect that this information had on paul was that paul had a life changing moment paul felt that he could relate to mr leonard in the fact that they both could not read paul then goes on to teach mr leonard how to read
21941,8,0,he wanted to get help
21942,8,0,paul notice that mr leonard was a track star he also found out that mr leonard could not read which reminds the narrator about him
21943,8,1,the effect the background information about mr leonard has on paul is that mr leonard was not a good student and either was paul mr leonard offered to train paul in hurdling and when paul found out the information about mr leonard it made him want to help mr leonard
21944,8,2,the information hit close to home for paul he feels that he is going through some of the same things he sees himself in mr leonard's shoes so he follows him to the gym and becomes a hurdler and trains when he learns about mr leonard's acivements he is amazed and decides that he will be educated unlike mr leonard
21945,8,0,paul didn't know anything about him at the begining and just thought that he was just a man in hallway when mr leonard took paul to the track that fist day he saw that mr leonard cared and that he wanted to help him he wondered way mr leonard asked his name that first day after seeing his pass for 2 weeks he found out that me leonard's grade were bad and that he didn't make it through collage that's why mr leonard cared so much about paul getting his grades up and being involved in something
21946,8,2,he is shocked that this hall monitor was once an exceptional track runner but like paul he cant read very well and school is a struggle for him it made paul feel like that maybe he can do this trac kthing and still be able to succeed at school some things just come easier for others while other people might have to work harder like for paul and school
21947,8,1,during the the story paul gets numerous background information about mr leonard such as he was a track star when he was a freshaman in college and just like paul he struggled with his academics mr leonard's background information effected paul because all his problems are similar to mr leonard paul begins to excel in track soon mr leonard begins to realize that paul is just like he was back in college also paul realizes that since mr leonard was not successful in college that gives him more motivation to succeed in school and in his athletics paul also realizes that mr leonard wants him to become the better person then he ever was so he can say that he helped a child succeed in conclusion paul is effected by mr leonard's background information in a way that will help him become very successful in life
21948,8,0,it shows that mr leonard wants to see a person who had the same issues as he did succeed mr leonard knew that paul could be better because he actually got help for his reading and could make the grades while being a star athlete
21949,8,0,paul found out that mr leonards background as a track coach in college by the url website
21950,8,1,paul relized that him and mr leonard have a lot in commin paul probably feels like hwe is not alone he probably seem mr leornard as a role model for him
21951,8,0,then effect the information had on paul was a curious one in the story paul asks mr leonard why he didn't tell him about his college experience doing hurdles but the background information also showed paul that mr leonard knew what he was doing
21952,8,1,at the beginning of the story paul feels discouraged and embarassed of his lack of reading skill he often feels left out however after hearing of mr leonard's struggles of the same nature paul feels more determined and encouraged to succeed at reading and at his newfound talent track and field paul wants to make mr leonard proud by becoming a track star such as mr leonard was and by working hard on his school work
21953,8,2,the background check on mr leonard surprises paul because he never thought that he was a hurdler for a college team
21954,8,2,paul finds out that mr leonard too could not read he realizes that with effort he too can be a good runner also with some help he can teach mr leonard to be a good reader
21955,8,0,it teaches him to not give up in high school and to not flunk out he wants him to do good and get a scholarship to a good college
21956,8,0,the effect that the background information has on paul is now he is curious to why mr leonard is a hall monitor at the school paul asked why he didn't continue on in his success
21957,8,0,the effect is to make paul better at school because even though he might be a great runner you can't be in a sport with bad grades and mr leonard found that out the hard way when he was in college he lost his scholarship and flunked out because he coukldnt read
21958,8,1,the background information that paul finds out about mr leonard effects paul in a way of shock he is very curious to why he quit and what happened to him that he stopped when he found out the reason why he felt a bound they had
21959,8,0,because paul flunked college so its gonna be hard on him to play a sport an be a pro or anything like that causes he didnt do well in college
21960,8,0,paul wonders why mr leonard flunked out of college when he broke records mr leonard explaind that he when he went to college there was not a learning center where he could get help to read he relied on his friends in high school but college work is a lot harder than the high school work there was tutors to help him but they did not help him no college school wants a runner when the runner cannot read
21961,8,0,he have to leave class early and have to go and get texted ever to weeks
21962,8,0,i thonk that he felt a little intimidated at first his first inteaction with her was in the hall way he was sckared that he was intrubbl
21963,8,1,it shows paul that sometimes other need help also
21964,8,1,i feel like the information that paul has found on my leonard shows that he can do whatever he puts his mind to i also believe that it will push him to do better in the learning center while he is down there and will help him strive for more success in the classroom now seeing what can happen if he doesn't take his school work serious he will attempt to become a much better student
21965,8,0,paule is comming to the understanding about the guys problem and is trying to make him feel better by saying he had the problem at one point and time
21966,8,1,paul is at first shocked when he discovers mr leonard's past when paul interviews mr leonard about his past however paul respects and admires mr leonard more than in the begining as a result of the new admiration paul decides to help mr leonard like mr leonard helped him an example that reflected paul's emotions toward mr leonard would be in the 45th paragraph in the 4 6 sentence
21967,8,1,it makes paul feel like he is not the only one who has a reading disorder
21968,8,0,the background information about mr leonard effects paul by paul looking up to him becasue he know what his is talking about
21969,8,1,he is shocked and impressed he wondered why mr leonard did not tell him mr leonard helped paul with something so paul helped him in return
21970,8,0,he found out that mr leonad was a college freshman who won 400 meter hurdles at the nationals he broke the record the coach was mr leonard
21971,8,0,paul is a poor reader and gets help from mr leonard
21972,8,0,in the story when mr leonard told paul about his back ground he really didn't understand mr leonard was talking about how he was god at sports but not a good enough student and pual didn't understand because mr leonard had gone to college so in the end pual help mr leonard start trainging agian
21973,8,0,paul may not think that mr leonard is a good enough athlete and a good coach
21974,8,0,they got him to jump over a huedle
21975,8,0,in this story mr leonard looks and see how he is going to be like he keep askingh stuff about him he also stay in the staiwell because he kniows taht paul leaves classes early eveyday because he knew thathe cant leave so he follow him and mad sure that he has help to read and he is a teacher that helps people with problems
21976,8,2,the background information lets paul learn a little more about mr leonard after getting the information he takes an interest and asks questions the information helped paul see the similarities between the two and realizes why mr leonard chose to help him in appreciation paul reacts by wanting to return the favor and help mr leonard with his own obsticle in life reading
21977,8,2,whenever paul realized that mr leonard was a track star he probably started to feel as if mr leonard wanted him to be just as successful in track as he was but dismayed because he didn't know why he chose him once mr leonard revealed his secret of flunking out of college due to failure of reading which made school harder on him paul felt a little more connected with him and it boosted his confidence
21978,8,2,the background information given about mr leonard makes paul feel several emotions he was excited to learn that mr leonard was an excelant hurdler who broke many records and got a college scholarship he is also saddened and humbled that mr leonard flunked out of college we no this from paragraph 45 where paul talks of how he relates to mr leonard and knows what it is like to no be able to read
21979,8,0,paul thinks of that background information is not a big deal because paul is less woried about mr leonard than himself
21980,8,2,paul can relate to mr leonard because both mr leonard and paul cannot read paul knows what it is like to not know how to read paul feels that mr leonard has helped him become good at a sport so paul is going to help mr leonard learn to read in paragraph 45 paul says 'suddenly i realized what i could do for him ' this thought shows that paul is going to help mr leonard
21981,8,2,paul is excited that mr leonard went to college he was happy that mr leonard was helping him paul wanted to know why he wanted to help his running and jumping he then found out later on that he went to college for track but then flunked out because of his bad grades paul then felt he needed to help mr leonard out like mr leonard did for him
21982,8,2,the background information about mr leonard has a great effect on paul because he connects him to mr leonard by learning that mr leonard is unable to read just like himself paul feels a connection and feels like mr leonard gets him also by learning that mr leonard can't read paul feels he can relate to him and respect him more because mr leonard knows what it feels like fore paul when mr leonard talks about college and how he had to drop out because there were no tutors to help him paul then feels lucky that he has a place learning center where he has someone to help him learn to read
21983,8,2,paul printed out the papert about mr leonard and saw that he was a freshman in college who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals paul felt inspired but mr leonard feels bad because he flunked out of college
21984,8,0,mr leonard was a track star but had trouble reading and had flucked out of college and lost his scolarship for track it affected paul because he too has trouble reading and has fallin in love with track it shows paul that if he doesnt buckle down and get on track with his reading he could lose something that actually means something to him
21985,8,0,mr leonard was a trackstar in college but had bad grades now he works as a janitor checking hall passes and helps paul with his reading and let him trained because of his past failures
21986,8,2,the backround on mr leonard surprised pau because he never thought that a good athlete like mr leonard would be coaching when he could be racing perfeshinly after all those wins and records he made in college
21987,8,2,the effect are that paul is shocked that mr leonard cant read
21988,8,2,the background information that paul is presented with allows him to feel more personally connected with mr leonard paul feels connected to mr leonard because by both not knowing how to read they both knew about the embarrassing consequences that accompanied them whenever they were presented with a book magazine etc also paul feels the desire to be a good athelete like mr leonard and then ends up wanting to help him learn to read in return
21989,8,0,the background information on mr leonard at the begining of the story tells the reader that mr leonerd is a strick guy whom everyone lision to
21990,8,1,this man had given jis time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him paul wants to help mr leonard out because he help paul to be come better in something paul realized that you don't have to be perfect at everything
21991,8,0,this background information gave paul a chance to figure out why mr leonard was helping him at the track it also gives paul a reason to trust mr leonard since he was an athelete that could not read as well
21992,8,2,paul understands why mr leonard tells paul to keep up the good work at the learning center because mr leonard was just like paul when he was a kid but back then they didnt really have the help paul has now in helping him read
21993,8,2,paul is amazed that mr leonard was a star athlete but then when he asks about it mr leonard is sort of ashamed of himself he uses his life lesson to paul's advantage because me helps him not make the same mistake in his life
21994,8,0,it makes him want to try harder to succeed and work to be smarter so he dont fail
21995,8,2,paul was surprised that he was working with a guy that broke records as a freshmen in collage pauls was showing him the pictures he got off the internet website that the track coach gave him paul then asked mr leonard what happend and mr leonard got kinda sad and his voice changed when he told paul he couldnt read eather so then paul said its time to start your training agian i think paul was happy to be coached by one of the best
21996,8,2,paul realizes that mr leonard had the same problems in school that paul has in school paul sees that no matter how good you're at a sport you still need to have a good education if mr leonard had a good education than he wouldn't of been kicked out of college paul also sees that mr leonard helped him to overcome some of his fears and heartaches and so paul wants to help mr leonard in the same way he is going to teach mr leonard how to read
21997,8,2,when mr leonard told paul that he was a poor reader and he was embarresed about it paul realized that he had felt the same way and that he had a lot in common with mr leonard and so he decided to help mr leonard on reading
21998,8,2,paul discovers mr leonard's past of being an amazing track and feild runner at college his freshman year and so he discovers that he didn't continue after that because he lost his scholarship due to the fact that he couldn't read mr leonard's the hall monitor and sees paul go every time he's in english class to the learning center to learn how to read and he got the idea to teach him how to run track so he could get to know paul better the effect of this news causes paul after mr leonard explains what happened in college to help and take him to the learning center and learn how to read
21999,8,2,when paul found out about mr leonard he became puzzled he then asked mr leonard about why he never told him about his past mr leonard wanted to help paul to succeed after hearing mr leonard's story paul is as motivated as he has ever been to do well in school paul then wants to help mr leonard out by teaching him how to read
22000,8,2,paul was shocked when he found out that mr leonard was a hurdler and he had broken national records but he also had sympathy for him after he found out that he couldnt read
22001,8,2,the background information on mr leonard helps paul realize how similar they are he notices the feelings of embarrassment that mr leonard has towards his inability to read this then leads to him offering to help teach mr leonard to read just like mr leonard taught him how to do well in track
22002,8,2,when paul discovers the background information on mr leonard and how he too had trouble reading and flunked out of college paul is prompted to overcome his challenges and not end up like that he also is even motivated to help mr leonard with his own reading problems
22003,8,1,paul has feelings of understanding he has gone through the same things the mr leonard has gone through it is sensed that there is an eagerness in paul he has an eagerness to learn from mr leonard both athletically and in how to handle situations that present themselves in life paul also shows a willingness to teach even though he himself cannot read he still is trying to urge mr leonard to learn to read with him
22004,8,2,the background information paul finds out about mr leonard help support him to do the best he can 'it's time to start your training '
22005,8,2,once paul had checked out the website mr leonard told him about he was curious to why he didnt tell him that he was a college track star since paul came back the next day knowing that information about mr leonard it was obvious to mr leonard that paul learned how to read this also makes there relationship better because they both had similar problems that they overcame paul joined the track team and at the very end paul offered mr leonard a reading lesson
22006,8,2,it motivates him to work harder in school he wants to succeed at track but to do that he needs to succeed academically as well it allows him to empathize with mr leonard they both have experienced embarassment on account of their reading disability this causes paul not only to want to do better in school and track but also to help mr leonard overcome his reading disability just like he helped paul overcome his lack of athletic skill
22007,8,2,when mr leonard says 'i lost my scholarship and flunked out' it says paul feels like 'mr leonard's words were all to familiar to me ' paul then connected with him because mr leonard is going through the same ordeal as paul then starts their friendship
22008,8,1,the background information on mr leonard makes paul want to help him on his reading skills mr loenard helped paul so paul decides to help him in return
22009,8,2,paul finds out that mr leonard was an amazing track star and was an awful reader like himself paul also found out that mr leonard flunked out of college because the track team didn't want someone who could not read this discourages paul because this is a very similar situation that he could go through in a way paul feels comfortable because he knows that he's not alone in this because he has mr leonard by his side
22010,8,2,he was shocked that he had a college all star in track teaching him and he also didnt understand why he hadnt said anything about it wonce he finds out what he happended to him he wants to help and said its time to start his trianing by teaching him to read
22011,8,0,it has a conetion with how paul is now in high school
22012,8,2,he completely understands how he feels he said he knew what it was like when he felt embarrassed when he was called upon to real aloud or when he did not know an answer everyone else knew mr leonard trained with him and made him better at hurdling he soon realized he could teach mr leonard how to read so he started his training
22013,8,2,the effect that the background reading has on paul is empathy paul knows how mr leonard feels because paul has problems reading too paul shows this empathy when he says 'the emotions of mr leonards words were all too familiar to me feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud ' the information shows paul that hes not alone and that he can make a difference on mr leonard by helping him to learn how to read like mr leonard had taught him how to hurdle
22014,8,2,paul is subjected to training from mr leonard after school on track and field this opens up questions as to why mr leonard is a janitor when he clearly knows alot about track and field these questions open up more ideas as to why mr leonard would help paul when paul discovers the truth to mr leonard's background he is astonished that he was trained by someone that was top notch in track and field
22015,8,2,mr leonard was a track star but he could not keep up in school he flunked out of college because he could not read paul realizes he needs to be able to read to be sucsesful
22016,8,2,the information about mr leonard's background encourages paul at first paul doesn't understand why mr leonard didn't tell him in the first place but then he realizes that mr leonard is only trying to help him avoid the mistakes that he made mr leonard is pleased by paul's efforts to improve his reading because it could prevent him from losing the opportunities that mr leonard did
22017,8,2,i think that the information paul has found about mr leonard effected him in different ways i do beilieve that paul was shocked to have found out that grabowski had set many records in hurdles but i also think he had to have known mr leonard knew what he was doing i think that paul was very sympathtic and understanding when he found out leaonard could not read the effect it had on paul most likely gave him hope toward himself the fact that paul is offering to teach mr leonard to read at the end of the story shows that mr leonard had effected him in a positive way
22018,8,2,in this story the main character paul can't read mr leonard stopped him in the hallway almost every day when paul was on his way to the learning center mr leonard would just glance at his pass and let him go eventually when mr leonard decides to start training paul on the hurtles paul starts getting really good at hurtles and running paul was talking with the high school track coach and the coach told him to look at the track and field website when paul found mr leonard as one of the past athletes he was shocked mr leonard told paul that he was once in college but he had to drop out because he could not read i think that since paul cannot read this information about mr leonard is very inspiring to him in a sense paul realizes he can make it to college but he needs to keep trying unlike mr leonard paul has a lot in common with mr leonard and i think that is inspiring
22019,8,2,the background information on mr leonard makes paul want to help mr leonard succeed at reading like mr leonard helped him suceed at hurtles
22020,8,2,the background information on mr leonard has an inspirational effect on paul this is shown in paragraph forty five when paul relates his situation of not being able to read well to mr leonard's situation mr leonard noticed that and decided to help paul become a good athlete so paul returned the favor and is going to help mr leonard with his reading
22021,8,1,it helps paul understand why mr leonard helped him with the training more it also gives paul an idea on how to help mr leonard as a payback
22022,8,0,it kinda made him disappointed becuase mr leonard never told him anything abou thow good of an athlete he was mr leonard also never told him that he could't read either
22023,8,0,that he was a track star in collige
22024,8,0,it helped because its information and any information normally helps or clears things up
22025,8,2,the background information just makes paul want to make mr leonard a better person he paul felt as if he should be able to help him out since mr leonard helped him out by making him a better runner so he feels inspired to help him learn work on how to read
22026,8,2,the information tells you that paul and mr leonard are alike they are both poor students who is not the good of readers that why mr leonard ask paul to do the hurdles he and paul are alike if they do something they work there hardest they will achieve anything
22027,8,2,paul learns that mr leonard struggled with reading when he was a young boy mr leonard went to college and was an amazing runner and all through school he was told that his grades did not matter that he would have tutors to help him one day he realized that college was harder than high school he lost his scholarship and flunked out no other school wanted a runner who could not read paul realized that mr leonard's word were all too familiar he new the feeling of not being able to read he knew that learning to read was very important
22028,8,1,it inspires him to help mr leonard with his reading just as mr leonard has helped him with track and field he feels inspired so since mr leonard has helped him he thought it would be nice to give mr leonard some help too
22029,8,2,the effect of learning about mr leonard's background is that he gains the knowledge that even the most seemingly successful people can suffer from similar struggles to him and that even the people he respects can use help from others
22030,8,2,the background infromation that paul learns about mr leonard effects him by showing him others go through the same thing and that hes not alone pqul also feels the same emotion of embarassment as mr leonard did and he then realized he could help him out to
22031,8,2,the effect that this background information of mr leonard has on paul is somewhat overwhelming for paul he probably cannot believe he has been working out with such an outstanding star and athlete when paul finds out why mr leonard loses his scholarship he feels bad for him this only encourages paul more though he realizes that mr leonard did not have the programs that kids today do and with mr leonard showing how much he cares about him paul will be taking full advantage of those programs to learn to read better and become a much better student
22032,8,2,the information paul learns about mr leonard affects him because he can relate to his story very easily because they both can't read it also motivates paul to help mr leonard learn how to read
22033,8,0,mr leonard tells paul that he used to jump over the hurdels in college and paul has enough confidents that he could do it to
22034,8,2,the background information that paul finds on the website given to him causes him to have a common ground with mr leaonard since mr leonard stuggled with reading as well and did extrememly well in track
22035,8,2,at first paul is excited to learn he has been training with a track star then he realizes that mr leonard has given him a gift of track and when paul learns that mr leonard can't read paul gives him the gift of reading
22036,8,1,it lets paul know that he isn't the only one who has problems reading mr leonard said that he wasn't a good student and that is why he lost his scholarship and flunked out paul said that he knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called up on and didn't know the answer or told to read aloud
22037,8,0,paul is effected by the discovery because he has the same problem that the janitor has paul understands how the janitor feels and wants to know more about the janitor's life in college and why he is not still running today
22038,8,1,the effect of finding out the background of mr leonard on paul is that he wants to help him learn how to read like mr leonard helped him how to jump hurdles better
22039,8,0,the background information he gets bothers him because he doesnt know if he can add up to all of it ti impress him
22040,8,2,paul was surprised that mr leonard was such a great athlete when mr leonard told him 'i was a great athlete but not a good student ' paul knew what mr leonard was doing paul understaood that mr leonard was in the same situation as him and he wanted to help him as much as he could try and get paul to understand that he can build his confidence to be a good student and be the good athlete also
22041,8,2,the background information had a great effect on paul in the story because paul learning that mr leonard couldn't read just like paul it motivated him to try harder to excel at running hurdles as well as school work 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could do for him ' this quote proves my point that after learning background information on mr leonard paul was ready to get better at track and school
22042,8,2,he listens more to what mr leornard has to say also in paragraphs thirty three down to fourty five paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star but flunked out of college this fact got paul to work harder at hurdles and help mr leonard
22043,8,2,after learning the background information of mr leonard the effect it has on paul changes his views paul learns mr leonard was a great athlete that even broke records his freshman year of college when paul learns mr leonard flunked out he can't imagine why mr leonard wants paul to know that an athletic career might get him a scholarship but won't save him embaressment if he doesn't know how to read after paul learns mr leonard is still embaressed that he can't read paul wants to repay mr leonard with the same confidence he gave to paul paul takes the initiative to in turn train mr leonard in reading as mr leonard has trained paul to have confidence in both reading and life
22044,8,0,paul probably felt special when he found out that mr leonard has broken national records in hurdling and wanted to train him he must have felt like mr leonard cared about him
22045,8,1,paul feels that he can relate to mr leonard because they both share the same problem this is evident when paul says 'the emotions in mr leonard's voice were all too familiar to me' after mr leonard explains his troubles with reading
22046,8,1,they both had something in common they both couldnt read and they wanted to do sports the only reason the teacher wanted to help the kid was because he wanted to play in a sport when he was young but he couldnt because he couldnt read
22047,8,0,he wants to be good at track
22048,8,2,he has more respect for the lessons leonard is teaching him because he finds out leonard was a track star so he probably knows what he is doing
22049,8,1,in the story paul gets information on the mr leonard and this effects paul in good way because this is an insperation to paul to go after what he wants
22050,8,2,the background information about mr leonard has a great effect on paul he has many emotions going through his head because he realizes that he is a younger version of mr leonard he thinks about how he knows the feelings mr leonard felt since mr leonard helps him so much on hurdles he is going to help him read the fact that mr leonard had never gotten the remediation that paul was getting in school now makes paul even more motivated
22051,8,2,paul understands that mr leonard is trying to help paul acheieve in something else mr leonard was at the time where he didnt have what paul has mr leonard relied on friends to help him get by paul works harder now becuase collage scouts told mr leonard that grades didnt matter but the real truth was that they did mr leonard flunked out because collages didnt want a runner that couldn't read
22052,8,2,learning about mr leonard's past made paul understand that someone understood how he felt in lines 45 47 paul says that he and mr leonard both feel the same way about their reading issues he also realized that he could return mr leonards generosity and in line 46 implies that he will do this by teaching mr leonard how to read paul became more motivated by mr leonard's story both about running the hurdles and learning to read
22053,8,2,paul wonders what happened to mr leonard that would have him ending up being a janitor and when he finds out mr leonard flunked out of college it helps him remember that he needs to learn how to read well the narrator doesn't want to feel embarrassed anymore and seeing mr leonard and finding out about his past makes it feel even more crucia for him to learn to read so he can better himself in life because only he can decide his future and it helps him realize that now that he has the tools to suceed he should help mr leonard out too
22054,8,2,the background information has an empathetic effect on paul he realises that mr leonard has had a hard life and that he didn't get to do what he wanted to do paul starts to feel the need to help mr leonard back by helping him to learn to read
22055,8,2,the information helps paul realize what he can achieve if he works hard mr leonard was and excellent athlete but not a good student so he was given a scholorship for track and field even though he did not recieve good grades he later flunked out of college because he did not earn good grades by not worrying about them he wants paul to work hard and learn how to read so he does not have to go through what he did it shows paul how to get over obstacles
22056,8,0,that paul is geting helped in the spots he want to get better at and mr leonard is geting helped in his reading
22057,8,0,it shows that even some of the most talented kids have problems in show area of their life in the story mr leonard can not read which showed paul that everyone has problems
22058,8,1,paul feels sorry for mr leonard he felt he had to do something to thank mr leonard for helping him be good at something
22059,8,1,the information that paul gets tells him that mr leonard is just like him
22060,8,2,when paul finds out that mr leonard was a record breaking college hurdler he is surprised this makes him wonder why he is pushing him to be an athlete which he finds out is because paul and mr leonard are almost the same person but at different points in their lives
22061,8,0,paul is difrrent from them becaus he thinks that hes better then the other people and that he only knows how to do things his way and thats how its going to be he also thinks that he can do anything in life whitch is not like that you have to learn from it and then experice what you been throught after alking about it he acts more like a kid trying to remmember that happen during his child hood back then and trying to interact with other people acepting him because of who ihe is not because of how he look aae
22062,8,2,when paul finds out mr leonard was an old track star he wanted to know why he didnt tell him then he asked why he stopped mr leonard was embrassed to say that he had got kicked out of college because he couldn't read and his grades weren't there paul knew what it felt like to not be able to read since mr leonard was there to help him become better paul said ' it's time to start your training' saying that he was going to teach him to read
22063,8,1,before paul went up to mr leonard the effect of the information on paul is that maybe he could be as good as him the effect on paul after comfronting mr leonard was that since mr leonard was teaching paul what he knows about hurdling paul could teach mr leonard what he knows about reading
22064,8,2,when paul researched mr leonard he was shocked that mr leonard didnt share his past with him paul didn't understand why mr leonard would keep his track achievements a secret paul was shocked and confused paul said 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals you broke records ' mr leonard replied 'i remeber best race of my life ' then paul asked himwhat had happened
22065,8,0,paul gets what he wants to do by mr leonard because he want to be just like him so he strted in track which the teacher was mr leonard
22066,8,0,it made paul curious of why mr leonard didn't still run track
22067,8,1,after hearing the success and the downfall of mr leonard paul realizes that he has to keep his self motivated so he can reach success paul took mr leonard's story to heart you can imply this due to paul's last sentence of the text 'c'mon mr leonard it's time to start your training' i believe that paul was going to help mr leonard on his reading skills becuase he helped him on his track skills
22068,8,2,just as paul is finding all of the background information on mr leonard he is beginning to realize that he too can agree and relate to him because they both have that in common where reading and speaking aloud in the classroom is and always has been a struggle for them they have both looked for help in the learning center so they could finally become a better reader and be better at something in school 'the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me' 'i knew them well feelings of embarassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew ' paul knew the feeling he shared the exact same struggle with mr leonard
22069,8,1,it shows paul that he needs to overcome is difficulties he sees that mr leonard could have had a much better life if he had been able to keep up with the work as well as the running paul realizes that he should help mr leonard with his difficulties
22070,8,0,paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star in his college days he wonders why mr leonard quit running track if he was so good at it paul confronts mr leonard and finds out that he had flunked out of college because he never learned how to read we find out in the beginning of the story that paul goes to the learning center twice a day to learn how to read paul finds out through this experience that grades are important when it comes to college you may be good at sports but if you don't know how to read you won't be able to play sports because you may flunk out of college paul realizes that he is lucky to have found a companion like mr leonard to teach him a very valuable lesson about life
22071,8,2,paul most likely feels like he can relate more to mr leonard he knows that they both have a difficult time reading he feels like there is a kind of connection beween the two of them he knows that they both struggled with the same thing and he figures if mr leonard can help him gain confidence and be good at something he can help him learn how to read
22072,8,2,the background information that paul got motivated him to put mr leonard through training to teach him how to read because mr leonard helped him to become a track runner he knows the embarrassing feelings that mr leonard must have felt and now wants to help him overcome his problems
22073,8,0,it show very little about the brackground for paule
22074,8,1,the background information that paul learns about mr leonard effects him because mr leonard helped him overcome his differances so he wants to help mr leonard with his together they make a good team
22075,8,1,the effect it has on paul is kind of shocking to him when paul gets the background about mr leonard he was appauled he was shocked that he seen that mr leonard has all the records for the hurdles but when paul was talking to mr leonard he had no idea that he had dropped out of college and stopped playing sports because of his grades so the effect that it had on paul is that he knew that mr leonard knew what kind of struggles he was having and thats all that mr leonard wanted to do was to help him through it
22076,8,0,we learn through this passage that paul can't read and that he recieves help for it when mr leonard was a student he didn't try to get help for not being able to read and in the end he flunked out of a college and is now a hall monitor mr leonard is trying to tell paul that if he doesn't start to learn how to read no matter how good he is at something college won't take him he is also trying to show him how important reading can be
22077,8,1,mr leonard also had problems with reading in school as it mentions that he could not read in college this gives mr leonard and paul something in common ultimately it is an encouragement for paul to continue on with school and track
22078,8,1,the effect it has on paul is he gets confused and then encouraged because he can train mr leonard
22079,8,0,mr leonard reveals how he was an amazing runner in high school but he wasn't a good student he found school hard and flunked out of college mr leonard saw himself in the narrator and thats why he helped him so that the narrator could have a better more successful future with college jobs and sports what he didn't have
22080,8,2,paul is shocked that mr leonard can't read and trys to help him mr leonard dosen't want anyone to know that he can't read so he hides it
22081,8,0,mr leonard couldn't read just like paul couldn't read mr leonard felt embarrassed telling paul he wasn't a good student and he couldn't read whenhe was in college and mr leonard still can't read
22082,8,1,the background information effects paul in a good way the background information shows paul that he needs to do good in school stay in track it also shows paul that mr leonard was a great track star and i think that would affect paul positively
22083,8,0,when paul discovered the background information about mr leonard he was suspicious to why he was never told about his achievements in track and field paul also wondered how he could have been so good yet ended up as a hall monitor this caused paul to confront mr leonard about it
22084,8,1,paul is intrigued and asks mr leonard what happened in paragraph 40 mr leonard's story inspired paul a lot because he too struggled with academics as well as reading
22085,8,0,paul realizes that the man is trying to help him the man used his own time to help paul to get better at something
22086,8,2,he believes that if mr leonard was a poor reader but could excel at track he could too he feels like he and mr leonard have a lot in common and begins to feel a connection with him
22087,8,0,it makes him want to show him that he can do his best and show how much he has help him
22088,8,2,the effect of the background information paul gets from the url the high school track coach gives him is fairly great knowing that mr leonard was a poor student and couldnt read just like paul is now brought them closer together this is strongly supported in the last two sentences
22089,8,2,once paul realized that mr leonard suffered the same difficulties with literacy that he himself struggles with paul has a new sympathy for mr leonard paul appreciative of the effort mr leonard is putting into helping him overcome his troubles decides to help mr leonard learn to do what troubled him in his college years their shared difficulty with learning to read gives them a similar perspective and allows each to sympathize and assist in any way they can
22090,8,2,paul is suprised that mr leonard was an incredible athlete but a terrible student the information caused paul to feel empathy toward mr leonard because paul is in the same situsation that mr leonard had been when he was a student mr leonard is trying to help paul become a better athlete and a better student by motivating him on the track field and it works because of paul's empathy towards mr leonard he is inspired to aide mr leonard in his reading studies
22091,8,2,it gives paul respect for the man who went through the same experience paul is going through now he felt mr leonard's emotions were familiar he knew that mr leonard started training him to make paul feel better about himself just as he had so many years ago paul felt he should return the favor and is going to teach mr leonard how to read
22092,8,1,paul kind of looked up to mr leonard so the imformation that he recived he was angry shock and unpleased
22093,8,2,the information he egt inspires him to teach mr leonard to read just as he tought him to do hurdles
22094,8,2,in the story when paul finds out that mr leonard used to be a track star and won many metals he was shocked and when he learned that he had to stop track because he could not read it made paul feel more couraged to read and be a track star
22095,8,1,i think that the background information that paul found about mr leonard had a suprising effect on him he was questioning how mr leonard did not know his name when he checked his hall pass twice a week
22096,8,2,the effect that the backgroud information has on paul is that its going to help him to succed in his career in the future when he foud out that mr leonard was a college freshman athlete that raced in the 400 metter hurdles and he won nationals he was surpriced that mr leonard had accomplished that but paul asked why he had stoped his career in track and mr leonard told him he was really good at track but he had a hard time learning and reading that they had give him the wrong advice paul is compared to mr leonadr in the way that both of them have a hard time learning but they are really good in the same sport mr leonar dis helping paul realize to study ahrd and he would accmplish many things in life like how he learned how to jump hurdles it was going to be the same with school is like a hurdle you have to practice to accomplish thing in life
22097,8,2,in the story paul gradually gathers information about mr leonard at fisrst this information makes paul suspicious of mr leonard he asks mr leonard why he didn't tell him when mr leonard explains his reasons paul is understanding and decides to help mr leonard this background information makes paul realize what he can do to help mr leonard
22098,8,0,the information that has on paul is what the story is telling us
22099,8,2,according to the story the background about mr leonard effects paul in a very positive way paul sees how good mr leonard could have been at track so that motivates him to keep working hard in school and in track in the story when paul says 'the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me ' that shows the readers what mr leonard means to paul mr leonard's was a lot like paul when he was a boy and that has an effect on paul paul now wants to strive forward and be the best he can be
22100,8,0,the effect of the background information is to help the readers understand more about what he went through in life
22101,8,0,the reader finds out that mr leonard was a bad student so he had to quit what he loved most
22102,8,2,he thinks about it and it reminds him about himself and what he had been going through so at the end he takes mr leonard and says 'it's time to start your training'
22103,8,1,paul is like mr leonard they both struggle with school work but are good at other things paul didn't realize until after he had already been training with mr leonard for quite some time then he felt even closer and somewhat connected with him
22104,8,1,it helped he to try and succed at what he was doing made him want to show the others that he could do something more
22105,8,2,when he was told that mr leonard had been a college track star i think that made him open his eyes a little wider and relize who he was working with after he went to that url ' you were a college freshemen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals' you broke records' when he saw that then he relized that he wasnt jsut working with a hall monitor he was working with a star
22106,8,2,the background information effected paul by showing him you can be anything paul thought mr leonard was just another janitor but he wasn't in the story paul shows excitement when he talked about mr leonard breaking records and winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals paul had the effect of someone he could look up to and learn from when mr leonard told paul he couldn't read paul told him it was his turn to train paul was happy to have a coach who did something great in his past paul realized you can't ever judge a book by its cover because you never know whats in the pages
22107,8,2,paul was suprised to know that he had been training with a college track star that broke records on a national level the reader can tell he was shocked when the narrator say 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records ' then the narrator asks him what had happend and was suprised to find out that mr leonard had the same problem that paul had
22108,8,2,paul wonders why mr leonard never told him about this and paul finds himself relating to his story because paul is not a good reader and neither is mr leonard this story about mr leonard doesnt really discourage paul but he finds himself wanting to help mr leonard the same way he helped him
22109,8,0,paul did not know that mr leonard was a track star in collage then he found out that mr lleonard failed out because he could not understand the classes mr leonard could see him self in paul he knew that he could do good in track
22110,8,2,it encourages him then he wants to help mr leonard learn to read
22111,8,2,the narrarator received background information from the track coach about mr leonard grabowski mr grabowski was a record breaking hurdles runner back in the day but at college his grades were so poor that he lost his scholarship and flunked out due to his disability to read properly he had lost it all when the narrarator asked mr grabowski about his past the narrarator saw similar emotions to what he was going through when he got embarrased as he struggled at reading aloud or when he didn't know the answer that everyone else in his class knew the narrartor completely understood why mr leonard was embarrased by his past
22112,8,0,it confuses paul because mr leonard was so good at track he didn't know why he stopped running paul askes mr leonard why he stopped running
22113,8,2,he learns about him breaking records in college and being amazing at track this changes his view on mr leonard i think this makes him respect him more when he finds out about his reading struggle this allows him to relate with mr leonard
22114,8,2,the background information that paul gets on mr leonard helps encourage paul to keep going and to learn and to teach mr leonard how to read mr leonard said 'i was a good athlete but not a good student ' paul said at the evnd 'c'mon mr leonared its time to start your trainging '
22115,8,2,paul relates to mr leonard's story because paul couldn't read either in paragraph 6 paul states that he goes to the learning center because he can't read and in paragraph 44 mr leonard states that he was an exceptional athlete that could not read also hearing this story has changed paul because he wants to be able to give back to mr leonard what the hall monitor gave to him he does this by telling mr leonard to come with him to start his training in reading paragraph 46
22116,8,1,it has an effect on paul because mr leonard had the same problem that he did in school they both could not read well paul knows how he feels and mr leonard knows how he feels so they both will help each other out and listen to each other
22117,8,2,paul understands what mr leonard went through because paul is in the same situation as he was paul feels that since mr leonard helped him train for track that he must help him learn to read
22118,8,2,the background information helps paul better relate to mr leonard paul has reading problems just as mr leonard does and he feels like he is more welcomed by someone that has the same problem as him in my opinion paul is glad to finally have someone empathetic of his situation
22119,8,1,paul feels he has somethings in common with mr leonard when paul told mr leonard about the website mr leonard tells paul that he was a good runner but that he didn't know how to read the emotions in mr leonard were all too familiar with paul he knew the embarrassment of not knowing how to read
22120,8,1,the information that paul finds out about mr leonard on motivates him to do better for example when paul is told to go to the url website and then comes back the next day to ask mr leonard if he sould work out with the team mr leonard says yes when paul found out about mr leonard's education and about his college experience he was motivated to make mr leonard happy by showing him what he could do for him
22121,8,2,paul believes since mr leonard is helping him gain confidience that he has to help mr leonard some how mr leonard wants paul to be able to fill his dreams unlike mr leonard who didn't get that opurtunity
22122,8,2,after getting all of that background information paul realizes that mr leonard was trying to make paul better and that paul needed to do something for him in return after finding out that mr leonard had flunked out of college and didn't get to finish out his college career
22123,8,2,paul knows what mr leonard is going threw he himself cant read mr leonard conviences paul to do track mr leonard was a colloge drop out he cant read and paul wants to make him happy
22124,8,1,the effect that background information has on paul is the man had given his time to help him excel at something so paul realized that he could do something for him as well
22125,8,0,both mr leonard and paul have trouble reading and they both enjoy running track mr leonard is a pretty successful guy and he sees that paul can also be a successful student paul is also a great learner and could be helped by mr leonard because they come from the same background in this case mr leonard helps paul with his track and running while paul later helps mr leonard read
22126,8,2,the effect the background information on mr leonard has a profound effect on paul it helps paul to understand why mr leonard did not ask questions after paul told him where he was going as is shown in paragraph 45 paul can see that mr leonard regrets not having the learning center to help him learn to read this makes mr leonard want to help paul so paul doesn't suffer the same consequences because of this paul can understand why mr leonard treated him the way he did
22127,8,2,the effect of the background information is understading the similarities of mr leonard and paul give them a connection that furthurs their relationship by them both doing well in track gives them an opprotunity to bond and for mr leonard to help teach by them both struggling with reading gives paul an opprotunity to give back and help mr leonard
22128,8,0,the effect that the background has on paul is that both mr leonard and hisself have something in common with each other' which is that neither one of them can read paul learns that no one wants a person who can not read
22129,8,1,in the story the reader learns that mr leonard was a track star but he struggled with his school studies and could not read the author says '' i was a good athlete ' he said softly 'but not a good student '' i believe this has a very large impact on paul it shows paul that even though he may stuggle with his school work he doesn't have to struggle with everything else it motivates paul because if mr leonard could break records he could too paul also decided to help mr leonard with his studies because mr leonard helped him jump a hurdle in life
22130,8,2,the reader finds out that mr leonard is a 400 meter hurdles champion his freshman year of college paul was taken by surprise when he realized he was trainning with a champion hurdle star paul was pushed in track while trainning with a champion without knowing he was until he was given a website that had leonard on it
22131,8,0,it lets paul be more comfortable with mr leonard because they are one in the same after paul finds out about mr leonards reading problems he then goes on to say 'it's time to start your training' line 46 meaning he is going to start training mr leonard how to be a better reader this just emphasizes pauls level of comfortableness and friendship with mr leonard
22132,8,2,well it pushes paul to really work hard paul is wanting to be a great hurdler you can tell that in the story when he gets help he was getting trained to do well at it
22133,8,2,in the story paul finds out that when mr leonard was in school he could read either mr leonard see's himself in paul as a kid and wants to help him it shows paul even the best athletes scholars or anything aren't perfect just because they are amazing at what they do doesnt mean they have an easy life outside of that sport school function or even job
22134,8,1,what he trying to say is that as he met him he kinda liked him and understand him and the work that he's givin him
22135,8,2,the effect that background info has on paul is he now sees mr leonard as an idol and coach considering since mr leonard broke records at nationals in his freshman year of college
22136,8,2,during the story the reader learn's some of mr leonard's nackround the effect of that backround information on paul is that at first he doesn't know anything about mr leonard paul just thinks that he is a hall monitor to tell students where to go as the story goes on paul starts to learn more about mr leonard and the information starts to incourage paul by the end of the story pual and mr leonard know enough about each other that paul takes mr leonard to the learning center to help him read as mr leonard helped paul run hurdles
22137,8,2,paul relieved that there are other people out there that has the same learning problems as he does and to know that mr leonard broke a recorded in college for track was amazing to him
22138,8,2,after finding out the backround information on mr leonard paul understands why the older man is helping him and then paul decides to try and help the older man with his trouble reading just like mr leonard helped him become a fast runner one can see the effect that backround information has on paul when he says 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something suddenly i realized what i could de for him '
22139,8,0,paul knows that mr leonard cant read as well and that he had the same problems as paul did in high school and paul found out that his teacher is a former track star who now coachs the high school and won'ts paul to run track for the school
22140,8,0,when mr leonard told paul how good of a athlete he was in college he wanted paul to believe in himself and do something that he might like to do he also didn't want paul to make the same mistake that he did
22141,8,2,paul finds out about mr leonard's past and paul didn't really understand why he didn't tell him about his past with paul knowing what happened to mr leonard in his past because he couldn't read it could influence paul to work harder to learn how to read
22142,8,2,paul is supprised when he finds out that the reason mr leonard quit running track is that he can't read 'no other schools wanted a runner who couldn't read ' paul had the same emotion about the situation as mr leonard
22143,8,2,the backround information effects paul in a way that makes him connect more to mr leonard and have a better understanding of why mr leonard was encouraging him to run paul does not know how to read just as mr leonard did not know how to read when he was in school by paul realizing that mr leonard was trying to improve him and teach him to continue on it allowed paul to feel like he is not alone and other poeple are like him
22144,8,1,paul can relate to mr leonard because he was not a good reader either paul has the same problems and he finally found someone that could help him get through it mr leonard encouraged paul and made him believe that he sould try harder and not give up he also showed paul that there are many obstacles in life that you will go through
22145,8,2,paul is told to explore this website about mr leonard paul was shocked to see how good mr leonard was this information lead into that mr leonard could not read paul offered to help mr leonard so he could feel better

22246,8,0,paul gets background about mr leonard past mr loenard told paul about how he co
22247,8,1,at first paul seemed to be disappointed because mr leonard hid it from him but he was thinking in his mind that he knew where he was coming from the embarrassment and the teasing from other students he realized that mr leonard helped him excel in something and so the least he could do was give him something in return
22248,8,1,paul found something in commen with mr leonard and that is their problem with reading paul knew mr leonard since middle school who does his job very well it makes paul more active and found the imporatance of life mr leonard helped him to pass the obstacles that stopping him to do something he waant to do

22250,8,2,paul finds out about mr leonard and it makes him want to try because if he has someone that is that talented help him it will motivate him to do good paul trys hard because he wants to show mr leonard that he can do it and that he dont want to get picked last any more when he is playing a sport mr leonard explains to paul that you dont just get picked because you are good at a sport you have to know how to read and do math and things like that thats why paul needs to do good in school and not just sports when mr leonard was in collage he could not go to a learning center because they didnt not have one back then mr leonard told paul to take advatige of the learning center and get the help cause he needs it
22251,8,1,the information that paul finds out about mr leonard shocks him because he never told paul about his past and why he was so willing to help him become better at something he liked mr leonard was very helpful to paul but it never occured to paul that he was never asked his name until he met him after school at the track because he checked his hall pass twice a week
22252,8,1,the emotions in mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone esle knew
22253,8,2,it has an effect on paul because mr leonard can't read like paul they both are good runners and can do herdles and they both never learned how to read so the were alike

22255,8,0,the background information tells him that mr leonard was a really good sports player and that he had made records mr leonard didn't want to tell paul about it because he has had the same experience that paul had paul told him 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals you broke records ' 'what happened after that ' said paul mr leonard said 'i was a good athelete but not a good student we had no learning centers in our school i relied on friends to help me get by but even then the work was always too hard ' mr leonard doesn't want paul thinking he can't acheive something just because he didn't he wants him to try real hard which is why he decided to help him out
22256,8,0,my thoughts about the background information may differ on one hand i think paul may try to work hard on grades and excel on track but also at the same time he may question himself about what if this happens to me and give up on lreaning how to read better
22257,8,2,the effact it had on paul was great it made paul relate more to leonard and encouraged him to do better when he learns that leonard can not read he is encouraged to help his newly found friend out to teach him to read just as leonard help him find something the paul could excell at

22260,8,0,it makes paul want to be good in a sport he wants to have the fame and glory he wants mr leonard to teach him how to scuceed in the sport and make him as good as he was
22261,8,1,during the story the reader gets background information about mr leonard that effects the background information on paul because paul now knows that mr leonard went through the same phrase as him
22262,8,1,the background information that mr leonard tells to paul impacts pauls life mr leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals and broke records even though mr leonard was a good athlete he did not get good enough grades to pursue his scholarship and he flunekd out all the words mr lenoard told paul were very familiar to him
22263,8,2,the information that paul found out about was suprising because he didn't know anything about mr leonard being good in track he found it hard to believe he flunked college
22264,8,0,the information that mr lenonard gives him about college scares him he doesnt want to fail out of college like they other guy did he wants to make it in life and make sure that he is successful in all the things to come before him
22265,8,1,the background information that paul learns about mr leonard affects the way he sees sports and education when the narrator says 'suddenly i realized what i could do for him ' he learns that they could both help each other excel in education and sports
22266,8,1,it made paul feel like he wasn't alone or by himself after all in paragraph 45 paul describes how it effects him he says 'mr leonard's words were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew ' he felt bonded with mr leonard
22267,8,2,this new information changes his whole view of mr leonard he now realizes that mr leonard is like him paul in that he has trouble with being able to read as well
22268,8,1,the background information has inspired paul to learn how to read and do his best in school
22269,8,2,when paul gets backround information on mr leonard he is empathetic because he can't read either paul also said ' i knew them well feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew ' this statement shows how he is empathetic after this though he becomes strived to achieve in training for hurtles
22270,8,0,the effect that the background information gave on paul is that he should try to do the things that you think that you cant do if you have the right help and support you can do anything he shouldnt give up just because he can't do things other kids can you can do anything if you just try
22271,8,0,the backround information that paul gets about mr leonard is about how he was a runner for his collage and he flunked out he also lost his scholarship and he couldnt read and they didnt want a runner that couldnt read however the collage scouts told him his grades didnt matter he just wanted paul to understand thats school is very inportant
22272,8,2,the effect of the background information on paul was supriseing because he didn't know that mr leonard was a allstar athlete and even in school he had reading problems mr leonard wanted to show paul that he could over come his problems of not being able to read
22273,8,2,he goes to the website the track coach gives him to paul's disbelief he finds out that mr leonard was once a track star paul couldn't believe what he had found out he was astonished to see that mr leonard had won national races and broke records he confronted mr leonard about all of it he found out that mr leonard also had issues reading and flunked out of college because of it
22274,8,2,the information really changes the view of mr leonard in that at first from the aritcle he read he felt more admiring of him later when mr leonard tells him that he can't read he is smpathetic and more close to him because mr leonard is like him
22275,8,1,the training that helped paul couldn't read either so when paul figured this infomation out he knew how his trainer felt
22276,8,1,the background information about mr leonard gave paul so inspiration because since he had found out that mr leonard hadn't been so good in school paul was going to help him since mr leonard was teaching him track
22277,8,0,paul sees that he is being coached by a great athlete who had many successes that had to have made paul feel that he was going to get better because his coach had experience
22278,8,2,mr leonard embodies the once great old mentor cliche because paul is unaware of mr leonard's past and is used to following his orders paul is willing to try the things mr leonard confronts him with as stated in paragraph one the last sentence 'everyone complied ' no one questioned mr leonard and therefore his past was never questioned when mr leonard becomes empathetic towards paul it changes things when you become used to someone it becomes easier to question and learn about them paragraph eight foreshadows this relationship when it says the mr leonard's 'gaze softened' towards paul not knowing about mr leonard really has as much effect in the early stages of their acquaintance as much as later learning changes their relationship when the coach writes out a web address and tells paul 'visit this site do a search for 'grabowski '' it precludes the notion that mr leonard's life was dull and without bother for question rather it changes the accepted lack of knowledge to a pursuit of mystery finally when paul learns of the reading impairment that he shares with the old janitor the relationship is solidified because they have a common ground once the existance of this common ground is justified that is once paul realizes that there is a common place between them leonard grabowski becomes a much less abstract and more relateable figure for that reason the discovery of mr leonard's past effects paul and the background information that was previously missing completes the puzzle and lays the groundwork for a more realistic and compelling relationship between mentor and student
22279,8,2,once paul realizes that mr leonard has the same reading problem as him paul wants to help him just like mr leonard helped paul paul knows where mr leonard is coming from by the 'emotion in mr leonards vocie' 'the feelings of embarrassment' and not being excepted because 'no schools wanted a track runner who couldnt read ' so paul understanding mr leonards situations wants to help him train to be a good reader just like paul was trained to be a good track runner
22280,8,0,mr leanord was a track runner who was bad at school it says so in the story
22281,8,2,the new information motivates paul to do well and even to help mr leonard learn how to read
22282,8,1,paul is shocked that mr leonard was a highschool tack star paul wants to train with him even more now
22283,8,2,after knowing the background about mr leonard paul seemed to admire him when paul first found out about all the records mr leonard had broke he was amazed and shocked at the same time paul also felt sad for mr leonard since he could not read paul wanted a way to help mr leaonard since he had helped him so he told him it was time for him to learn
22284,8,0,the effect this has on paul is a postive effect he sees that mr leonard was very successful in something and he helped him become successful in it as well without telling him about his achievments paul asks mr lenord why he never shared this information with him this being a touchy subject when paul sees that mr leonard actually lost his scholarship due to grades it showed the importance of a good education
22285,8,2,the background information helps paul understand that mr leonard was in the same situation that he is in high school mr leonard couldnt read but he was good as an athlete just as paul is paul decides to help mr leonard learn to read
22286,8,0,paul doesn't understand why mr leonard flunked out of college because he thought that you had to be smart to there he was also curious because if he couldn't get through high school on his own how did he expect to make it through college
22287,8,0,the background of mr leonard is very similiar to paul's when you find out that mr leonard can not read just like paul but mr leonard did not have the resources that paul does in the end after mr leonard helps paul succeed at track paul uses his resources to help mr leonard
22288,8,0,he learned the coach couldnt read ans he was good at track
22289,8,1,i think the backgorund information has a big impact on paul one reason i think this is because since paul found out more about mr leonard it really encouraged him to go for what he wanted and not let anything stand in his way even if paul would ever fail on something he would have mr leonard right there telling him to get right back up and try again
22290,8,1,paul realizes why mr leonard has been helping him and helps him to understand better what his reasons were
22291,8,0,being known as the hall monitor without a secondary or primary source for paul there would have been no possible way for him to have known mr leonard as a hurdler it's easier to see him as an everyday average person as he seems than a famous record breaking champion in his youth with the average job he has
22292,8,0,its encouraging to know about his tutor
22293,8,0,the information makes paul curious as to why mr leonard hadn't told him that information the next day pual asked mr leonard about the paper he had printed off mr leonard tells him about it
22294,8,0,that he gets into trouble and that he gets talked to about it
22295,8,1,learning that mr leonard broke hurdling records in college made paul curious about him paul confronts mr leonard about it because he wants the teacher to explain it this realization also helps paul understand that mr leonard has been coaching him because he wants paul to succeed where he didn't
22296,8,2,the informatin paul recived aabout mr leeonard makes paul feel better pauls dont feel alone for not being able to read good because mr leonard didn't do good in school either
22297,8,0,it explains his life as a teacher
22298,8,1,paul knows almost exactly what mr leonard is going through they couldn't read but in pauls' case he has a class he goes to twice a week that helps him learn to read better mr leonard didn't want paul to end up like him but he felt that he had a connection with paul this whole time that mr leonard had been telling him 'on your way' he had been training his mind and body to react to what mr leonard says when leonard took him out to the track and said 'on your way' he was ready to listen he automatically responded to it by saying 'yes sir' when paul had found out what leonard was all about from when he went to the coach he was astonished he confronted mr leonard and asked him why he didn't tell him mr leonard explained the whole situation to him from that point on he understood what he had to do he got as much help as possible and in the mean time got help for mr leonard
22299,8,2,paul discovers that mr leonard failed out of college and lost his athletic scholarship because he couldn't read this causes paul to sympathize with mr leonard because he knows how the man feels they are both embarassed because of their inability to read so they both help each other mr leonard helps paul improve his athleticism through track and paul begins to teach mr leonard to read paul also realizes that he is not alone and that when another person helps you you can also benefit them
22300,8,2,mr leonard's background imformation effects paul because when mr leonard was young he flunked out of college because he said no one wanted atrack runner who could not read mr leonard is alo embarassed to admit he had flunked out of college this has an effect on paul because paul is not so good at reading and is embarrased to go to a learning center for tutoring this is why mr leonard's background effected paul and paul's motivation
22301,8,2,when paul finds out that the man who was coaching him at hurdling was a college star who broke national records he feels a little confused and more honored to be taught by someone like this supporting details that paul was confused could be when he brought up the page he printed off from the website where he discovered mr leonard's past mr leonard didn't seem too enthused by it but paul continued to pry and find out what happened once he knew paul then felt empathetic toward mr leonard since they shared the same problem
22302,8,2,the effect of the background information that paul found on mr leonard was that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals because of this paul realizes how important it is to learn and not give up in school i feel that being in track will make paul a better student and he will recognize how important learning is to make it through college
22303,8,0,after all of his training with mr leonard poaul gets fairly good at jumping hurdles so good that he gets asked to practice with the highschool track team after telling the coach about who he had been training with the coach gave paul a url to the schools track website paul discovers that mr leonard was a track runner when he was in school a very good one he won prizes and broke records paul was confused as to why mr leonard hadn't mentioned this to him before so the asked him mr leonard shared that he had been an excellent athlete but not a good enough student he wasn't given the opportunities or resources in school to improve so even though he was so good he was offered a scholarship he couldn't do the work and flunked out of college he was obviosly embarrased and didn't want to discourage paul because paul had natural talent
22304,8,2,the background information that paul recieves just sort of gives him an inspiration to continue trying his best he learns from mr leonard the importance of studying and making good grades for example mr leonard flunked out of college because of his poor grades this point proves that without good grades paul will basically go no where and end up being a hall monitor
22305,8,0,the narrator informs the reader that the coach was a college athlete that won the 400 meter hurdles in nationals witch means the coach has plenty of experence of running the track that information helped the narrator relizes that he is learning from one of the best and that he knows if he sticks to running he can do alot even if his grades are bellow average or that hes not a good reader
22306,8,1,the effect of the background info on paul is that he realizes he is not alone
22307,8,0,the effect that the background information has on paul is paul wants to be like mr leonard so he tries todo what he does most of the time paul just dont want to upset the coach so he does what he says anyways paul may also want to be encouraged by mr leonard to do the right thing and be the perosn that he wants to be in life so in my eyes that's the effect that mr leonard background information has on paul
22308,8,2,paul is deeply moved because he can relate with mr leonard about not being able to read paul wants to help him learn how to read since he is being taught at the learning center himself mr leonard never had the opportunity to learn when he was younger he is also surprised that mr leonard never told him about his track successes in college paul sees that he is a modest person who doesn't flaunt his gifts and talents
22309,8,2,the background information on mr leonard that paul found out effects paul because both have reading problems mr leanoard states 'i was a good athlete but not a good student ' mr leonard has taught paul to become a good athlete as of right now paul can't read very good mr leonard had the problem of not being able to read well like paul has now
22310,8,2,he feels empahy for mr leonard he knows how it feels to not do well when it comes to school paul feels embbarrassed when he has o ead aloud or doesn't know an answer everyone else knows
22311,8,0,the effect of the back ground information is that paul wants to know more bout mr leonards life after paul looks on the web site from the coach he finds out that mr leonard was a track person when he was in high school later finds out he cant read
22312,8,2,paul gets the information about mr leonard from the high school track coach and not from mr leonard himself paul is a little disappointed the next day that he did not get the information directly from mr leonard paul asks mr leonard about his college career and he explains that he was a great runner but did not do well in the classroom this makes paul understand why mr leonard did not tell him about his track career and paul feels he needs to help mr leonard as he helped him
22313,8,1,paul is confused as to why mr leonard did not tell him about his background information then he realized that just because someone cannot read does not mean that they cannot do anything else in life
22314,8,1,after getting the informaton about mr leonard paul reliezes that even though he cant read he shouldn't not that hold him back
22315,8,1,i think it gave paul confidence because mr leonard was not a good student like him but whent on to do amazing things in colage and setting many records i also motiveted paul to keep up his studies and use trake and a outlit from stress and school and to be able to fit in more
22316,8,0,it effects paul because leonard can't read either just like paul but leonard teaches paul that a hurdle is just like life and you can over come it and do good in your future
22317,8,2,the information helped the paul realize why mr leonard was helping him and when he finally figures it all out it only makes him want to try harder and also help mr leonard learn to read to when he says ' c'mon mr leonard ' 'it's time to start your training '
22318,8,2,the background information that paul gets on mr leonard has an effect on him because it inspries him to help mr leonard since he found out he cant read so when he did he found that out he said 'c'mon mr leonard ' walking back toward the school 'it's time to start your training '
22319,8,0,the author learns of mr leonard off a web site and is cofused about his findings so paul goes to talk with mr leonard to find out if what he has found is accurate this is in paragraph 35
22320,8,2,the background information paul got about mr lenoard effected him because he knew someone who was very good at track was teaching him when mr leoard told paul he couldnt read and he flunked out of college because he couldnt read it made paul want to work hard paul helped mr leonard read
22321,8,0,the background helps us understand the story more
22322,8,0,the background information about mr leonard that paul is effected by is that mr leonard isn't the best reader ever and paul was going to the learning center for reading help paul thought mr leonard had gone to college paul had then found out that mr leonard was a track runner and not a very good student in school that had effected paul
22323,8,2,the information that paul gets on mr leonard is a big part of the effect that he has on paul paul realizes that they relate to eachother alot and that it makes sense why mr leonard is being so helpful to him they share the same emotions as paul says the feelings of embarassment when approached with not being able to read they are one in the same
22324,8,2,the effect of the background information has on paul is that is shows him that mr leonard was just like him he finds out that mr leonard couldn't read either mr leonard says in the story that he couldn't read but back then there were no remdial reading programs he also flunked out of college because of it but the information shows paul that mr leonard is just trying to give this kid the help he couldn't get when he was in that situation
22325,8,1,the information paul gets helps him because he knows now that you dont have to know how to read to be succesfull at things
22326,8,0,the background information helps the narrator learn more about mr leonard and his past it also informs paul of why mr leonard is helping him with the hurdles on the track by looking up the background information paul learns that mr leonard was a famous track star that won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals he also learns that mr leonard flunked out of college and lost his scholarship because he could was illiterate then he realized why mr leonard was so empathetic when paul said he could not read either
22327,8,0,the effect that the background information the narrator has on paul is he was a great runner but he lost all of his things such as his scholarship because his grades were not good enough for the college he was accepted to
22328,8,2,the effect that the background has on paul is that he is shocked because mr leonard didn't tell him about his past of being a former track player and couldn't read and paul had wondered why mr leonard was helping him
22329,8,0,the effect that the background information has on paul is that mr leonard told him the college scouts told him that his grades didn't matter that he would have tutors to help him but also that he thought college is a whole lot harder than high school he went on to say that he lost his scholarship and flunked out of high school he mentioned that no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read the effect was that paul felt bad for him but he felt the same way so there wasn't much of an effect if there was any effect it was emotionally
22330,8,2,when paul found out that mr leonard broke records in college but then didn't finish college made him confused when mr leanard told paul that the reason he couldn't finish college because he didn't take school seriously paul was surprised and knew that if he followed his dreams and worked hard at school and life he could accomplish anything since paul had the privilege to work hard in school and do a sport that he worked hard to be good at he would do anything to succeed mr leonard believed that paul had potential
22331,8,1,the background information about mr leonard seems to help paul to try harder to strive for excellence he is first a little suspicious when he is stopped and asked where he is going and why he is going to the learning center he soon starts to be coached by mr leondard and forms a better relationship with him paul grew really suspicious when mr leonard asked paul his name even though he checked paul's hall pass twice a week then the track coach told him to do a search for grabowski on the internet he finally realized who mr leonardd really was
22332,8,0,paul finds out that mr leonard also had a reading dissability in school the first clue that hints this is when mr leonard asks paul what his name is paul then wonders why he would ask that when he had seen his hall pass for days straight once paul finds out about the dissability that mr leonard has he then becomes encouraging and tells him that they need to start training mr leonard for track this whole situation has a very positive affect on paul
22333,8,2,paul is shocked to find out that mr leonard has trouble reading also but that did not stop him from succeeding in a sport paul relizes that mr leonard helped him and feels that he should help mr leonard read now
22334,8,2,as one is reading this section one may notice that mr leonard is from the start a very important man in the narrators life one may also notice that as time goes on and after the narrator or paul recieves the url that he find not only helped paul but was also a famous runner he had broken many records and was very fast at running after paul asks mr leonard why he had not choosen to tell paul about his famous ascubuidy he discovers that mr leonard had flunked out and that he could not read paul instead of feeling disapiontment one may feel that he gained respect for mr leonard i believe this to be true because in this article paul says this 'c'mon mr leonard its time to start your training '
22335,8,0,paul was a track star in high school and collehe but he had a problem he did not amke good grade so there for he was kicked off the team and also out of college there for his track days were over
22336,8,2,the background information that paul receives gives him more confidence because there is a grown man who went through the same things he was going through when paul found out that mr leonard couldn't read but still went to college showed that there was hope for him even though mr leonard flunked out he knew that if he pushed and worked hard at learning to read and with track he could go to college as well
22337,8,0,mr leonard did not learn how to read well when in high school so when he found paul going to the learning center he felt the empathy to help him and train him 'the emotions in mr leonard's voice were all too familiar to me i knew them well feelings of embarassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew
22338,8,1,it impresses him to see how good mr leonard used to be this also confueses him becuase he doesn't understand why he didn't tell him about his college successes
22339,8,1,towards the ends of the story paul discovers that mr leonard was a very good track star and that he even broke records when mr leonard later revealed his story about how he always got by in life this sparked a light in paul's head he then relized that he to was turning out to be just like mr leonard the only difference is the paul was making steps to fix the problem at the end of the passage paul makes mr leonard follow him as he takes him on a journey to reading
22340,8,0,the background information makes paul upset because mr leonard didnt tell him
22341,8,2,paul reads that mr leonard was a great track and when he asks mr leonard about it he says that he lost his scolarship and flunked out paul can relate because he says he's one of the 'select few in the remedial reading program ' he feels empathetic for mr leonard and wants to help him learn to read and maybe help him get some of his confidence back
22342,8,2,it really inspires him it shows him that mr leonard knows what he is talking about but is concerned at the fact that he doesnt know how to read so sense mr leonard helped paul with sport he is goin to teach him how to read
22343,8,0,paul was a good kid in school he was one of the selected students in the remedial reading programs
22344,8,1,when paul finds out about mr leonard's past his attitude changes towards mr leonard paul begins to trust mr leonard more and is more willing to listen to his coaching advice it also makes paul feel less alone to know that he isn't the only person to have reading problems mr leonard's story encourages paul to do the best he can in school and to not give up on his dreams
22345,8,0,'things were different back then'' the college scouts told him that his grades didn't matter
22346,8,0,i think there is no effect on paul because he was just doing a background check on someone
22347,8,2,the backgorund information is really important in this story or it would really have never ended the backgorund information came from the track coach just curious to see if paul would actually check it out he did and found out that the guy that was helping him was a real athlete but once paul talked to him paul realized that mr leonard had the same problem he did he couldn't read so for paul to find that out is pretty important because mr leonard will push paul to do and good in school and take his place as a track hero
22348,8,0,he finds out that he was a track star in college for the hurdles he looked him up on the school website he did not know this at first and he wonders why he did not tell him he is curious why mr leonard did not tell him this
22349,8,2,the effect the information paul finds out about mr leonardo is sympathetic he finds out that mr leonardo was a wonderful athlete but he didn't make it far because he couldn't stay in college because he couldn't read after finding this out paul wants to help mr leonard learn how to read

24773,9,2,the author organizes the article in a very lovely easy to read way first he starts it off with a nice introduction of wondering what could possibly be up in that sky of ours and then we find out its just a tool bag then he informs us that there is space junk floating in orbit around our planet he then lets the reader become familiar with what space junk is and how it gets there next he explains how satellites can randomly crash into each other which explains all of the 'space junk' floating around sort of like the climax of the article the last thing he states is that though the particles may be small that they are orbiting at such great speeds that even though they are so small they still can create much damage
24774,9,1,the author starts out the article with an introduction to grab the readers attention by saying a simalar quote that was used in super man after this he explains what space junk is and the diffrent types and how it gets there next he tells about examples on how more space junk is created like the dead satellites colliding or human error like letting go of a tool bag finnaly he tells about the dangers and harmful effects of space debris an example he uses to show the danger of micro debris is showing the difference of sand and then sand in a sand blaster and it being able to knock of paint
24775,9,1,the author tells where the space junk came from what it is and how harmful it is he told us about the crashes and where the rockets go
24776,9,1,the author begin the article by identifing what space junk is then by presenting his veiw of it and how it is harmful to earth's surface
24777,9,1,he seperates the paragraphs and titles them each of what he is talking about in each paragraph
24778,9,1,stats with a begining has a brief middle with lots of persuading facts has an interesting ending
24779,9,2,the author organizes the article into sections there is a section explaining what space junk is there is one about satellites colliding in space there is also one explaining how even the smallest space junk still causes major problems each one of these sections are then divided into smaller paragraphs this helps the reader separate their own thoughts to better understand the article the author also mixes interesting comparisons with facts so that the reader will get good information with out also getting bored
24780,9,2,the author orginizes this by catching your attention in the introduction then in the next paragraph it basically explains what exactly space junk is it tells the past of it and everything then in crash course the author explains to us what is happening with the satillites that are in space and in the last paragraph they really emphazie that this really is a big deal and that the little pieces that we can not detect is really effecting space
24781,9,1,the author organizes the article by giving titles for each section it tells you about the topic and why its important
24782,9,2,first he grabs interest with a creative quizical introduction that despite being playful at first introduces the seriousness of the matter then he introduces space junk by informing the reader with examples of how it comes about next he goes into greater detail with the following two paragraphs 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' 'crash course' describes the risks presented by dead satellites 'little bits but a big deal' exposes the risk of tiny space debris then concludes the article restating the negative effects space debris can cause
24783,9,1,first the author starts the article off with a fun yet playful begining then the author gets to the point with the important details he tells use about the history of space junk how it will eventually effect us and how it is increasing
24784,9,0,by saying what is space juck to start off with the first pargraghe that to me was a start of something new i would want to read
24785,9,1,the author organizes the article by first having an attention grabbing introduction next the author provides background information to inform the reader about what is going on after a background is established the author provides the problem and importance of his article lastly the author ends his article with the effects and his hopes for a solution
24786,9,2,the author starts out with an introduction that catches the reader's attention throughout the rest of the article he has three more main points that emphasize different subjects 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' the author ends with a conclusion that wraps up the article nicely and emphasises the importance of the topic
24787,9,2,the author organizes the aritcle by explaining what space junk is with the section 'what is space junk ' he then shows what can happen when satellites crash into each other with the section 'crash course' he shows how little bits of debris are bad by the section 'little bits but a big deal'
24788,9,1,the author has put titles of names above each section so it is easier to remember
24789,9,1,the author organized his article into different points so the reader can get factual evidence of what happened and predictions for facts he put in that in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite and for predictions he states that space trash is increasing and more people will have to deal with this problem
24790,9,2,the author organizes this article by starting off with background information to saying what can happen if the space junk does collide with another sattelite to saying how space debri is a huge threat and can create a huge problem
24791,9,1,at first he describes what the matter is then talks about how that things that are still in orbit that are non useful are in the way and then describes how all that stuff can cause damage to the spacecraft that is launched
24792,9,1,the arthor organize the piece by getting more serious as it goes on starts off with the introduction then give history then tell about the collisions and tells how it harmfull
24793,9,1,the author organized the article by giving an introduction with personal anecdotes the author then follows with three other sections that contain important information and facts about space junk
24794,9,1,the author gives details abot what is space junks is and how the junks is really dangroues to the spacecraft how the goverment is concern about the space junk and the author how its little bit of stuff had it is a big deal
24795,9,0,the author orginizes the article with titles of every paragraph so the reader will know what to the author is talking about
24796,9,2,the author organizes the article by first grabbing your attention in saying that you might see a toolbag in the sky he she then introduces the problem of 'space junk' and says how it is a problem next the author goes into a further explanation of what 'space junk' really is next he she goes on to talk about how the 'space junk' and satellites can cause large harmful crashes and collisions in space last the author tries to amaze the readers by describing how excessive force of small objects can cause a big problem
24797,9,0,the auther arganized the article be tiling you how the things got in spase and thin gives the problem that they have or might couse
24798,9,1,the author organizes the article by staring out with startling statements about space junk and then giving information about space and our travels to space then the author talks about the problems with space travel the the author talks about the things that happen while in space and what happens to the austronauts that go up into space
24799,9,2,the author organized the article by the way the sections go with each other 'what is space junk' can be connected to 'crash course' because the tiny things that float above the atmosphere can be considered space junk and can still be on a crash course of something 'little bits but a big deal' can be connected to both other sections because they all have to do with the dangers of small or large objects floating through space and becoming a danger to the spacecraft and the astronauts on or in the spacecraft
24800,9,2,the author organizes this article in different sections full of information he informs us on the harmful effects of space junk and also provides information about the past involving space exploration and how this 'space junk' has found itself beyond earth's atmosphere
24801,9,2,the author organizes the article into multiple sections based on subtopic there is the introduction then 'what is space junk' a section about the origin and nature of space junk then there is 'crash course' a section about sattelite collisions creating microdebris and finally 'little bits but a big deal' about the effects of space junk
24802,9,1,the author organizs the information in the way that helps us to understand the information better and still get the point across when he uses titles that are very explaintory it shows us in a good way
24803,9,1,the author has a subtitle that says 'what is space junk' then the author gets to the point of their topic
24804,9,2,the author organizes his paragraphs in specific sections first he has an introduction which capture the reader's attention then he wrote 'what is space junk ' which is a section that gives a history of space travel after that is the 'crash course' which explains the crashing of satellites into debris finally is the 'little bits big deal ' and this is a section about the imporatnce of what he wrote about
24805,9,0,the author puts everything in order from lift off to the ending of the space craft
24806,9,2,the author starts with a flashy introduction to grab the reader's attention the reader then goes on to describe the definition of space junk in the section 'what is space junk ' he describes what constitutes space junk in this section of the article the author then informs the reader that space junk can collide and provide danger to the people on earth as well he describes this in 'crash course ' he describes microdebris in 'little bits but a big deal ' he finally concludes in a pessimistic manner stating that space junk is actually increasing
24807,9,0,the author in my opion did organize it well because he has dates showing when something happened and the author stays on topic with each paragraph that was written
24808,9,0,well i hink with how she set up her information on space travel and on how harmful microdebris really is
24809,9,0,the author organizes this article as if he is very serious about the matter and wants to put all the concerns about space junk in the story
24810,9,2,the author uses many different styles of writing one of them includes his organization the author uses a different style of organization than other authors he doesn't write in chronological order he mostly organizes from what's least important to the very important information the author starts with a shocking statement then goes on to explain his statements and tell his readers what space junk is he then talks about the effect space junk can have on other objects in space and in the end he really starts to talk about what people think about space junk and how dangerous it is the author starts with little information he is defining what space junk is and then the author gradually starts talking about what space junk does and its importance
24811,9,1,he organizes it by putting what has to be with what in each catorgorie
24812,9,0,the author organizes the the article by strting the article with an eyeopener 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor ' 'it's a tool bag the next thing the author does is explain the
24813,9,2,the article starts out in a comical tone to get the reader's attention and to make the article seem more interesing it later goes on to provide specific facts and details about the seriousness and danger of'space junk' he provides facts about past space exploration projects and satellites that have crashed into each other while moving at high speeds creating a large amount of tiny microdebris using such facts he tries to get the reader to see the seriousness in the matter of 'space junk' in his conclusion he states that the amount of space trash is on the rise because more countries have undertaken space exploration
24814,9,2,the author organized the article by catching our attion by haveing a startling fact about things up in space then he gave us the background of things that happened in space that had to do with space junk after that he talks about the speed of junk and how harmful it really is to our planet if they crash then finally he talks about how big of an impact outter space junk has on our saftey here on earth
24815,9,2,the author combines there the story into sections the introduction is used to grasp the reader the next section defines what space junk is the next section gives examples of it happening the last section refers to it being a big deal
24816,9,1,he starts out with a hook to get the reader's attention about the paragraph using several different sentences he then states the general idea of the whole paragraph which is that many people are concerned about 'space junk ' he then goes on to explain exactly what 'space junk' is in the next section in the following section he explains how many pieces of small debris are created when satellites crash into each other or when astronauts accidentally lose a tool bag he then goes on to tell about what harmful effects 'space junk' can have he then concludes the article by stating his first idea again and stating that many organizations are trying to do something about the problem
24817,9,2,the author organizes this peice into different sections to help the reader better understand the importance of space debris for example the author separates the passage into four different sections with titles at the begining to help the reader better understand it
24818,9,1,the author organizes the article in a very logical way one that is the order a person would think when told the problem the author starts out with a hook that is a reference to a very well known line which then makes the reader want to read more and find out what the author is talking about the next thing that the author does is introduce the topic and explain what it is then the problem is stated along with the reasons why it is a problem and what caused it
24819,9,1,the author organizes the article by importance the author tells you about space junk what it is how it got there and how we can help
24820,9,1,the author organizes it from the beginning of the problem then gets to how we can solve the problem it starts with giving history of when humans first made it to space secondly it tells how we have traveled through space lastly it explains how we could solve the problem of space junk
24821,9,2,first the author gives a good ags attention grabbing statement then the authour talks about how orbital pathways are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions next the author state his her thesis statement also he she explain to us what is space junk and give us facts about his topic then he she have headlines and explain to us what that headline means
24822,9,0,the author organizes the article by giving very realistic details and by explaining things more clear by providing evidence in his story
24823,9,2,the author organizes the article by introducing the topic giving an example of when it could occur and exlpaining the effects of the situation the first section just explains the topic of the article the second section gives and example of when space junk was formed and what happened the third sections just explains what happens when space junk is formed and how is effects different things in the universe
24824,9,2,he organizes the article by subject for example 'crash course' describes the collision of an american and russian satellite and a toolbag lost in space and 'what is space junk' describes how debris from satellites in space is created
24825,9,1,throughout the article you come across many titiles this is a way to break each topic down to become more specfic with each title the author has a cathy pharse to go with it so at frist glance you think that the topic in minor or unimportant but you are wrong the author organized it from his to recents occurences so show that it has been a problem for some tinme now
24826,9,0,the 'junk' in space is very harmful to earths surface because if a metorite comes and crashes into earth that is becuse of all the trash in space
24827,9,0,the tool bags are the bast way to do it in space
24828,9,1,the author organizes the article by putting the topics about the paragraphs
24829,9,2,the author organizes the article by letting you know what they are talking about but without giving details than they give a paragraph titles 'what is space junk ' they than tell you what they are talking about in detail after you find out what 'space junk' is than they tell you stories of actual events that have happened in our space with the title 'little bits but a big deal'in part of the article is letting you know just because something is small and harmless when you get that going the speed of 'five miles per second' than you can cause some serious damage
24830,9,1,the author organizes it chronologically then factually it begins talking about space travel in 1957 then talks about more spance exploration in 2009 afterwards the article talks microbedris and more about broken satillites
24831,9,2,the author breaks the article into four sections the first section is the introduction in this section the author gives the audience a brief idea of what the article is about also drawing the reader in with 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor it's a tool bag ' in the next section 'what is space junk ' the author tells the audience about how space exploration started and the various objects that have been realeased into our solar system that are considered space junk in the next section 'crash course' the author describes how old satelittes that are no longer being controlled can crash into each other and create microdebris in the last section 'little bits but a big deal' the author explains how this microdebris travels ar high speeds and can still do damage to space ships and astronauts even though the microdebris is very little using this method the author is able to explain the harms of space junk to the audience in the simplest method
24832,9,2,the author organizes the ariticle by using bold faced headers at the beginging of the different sections the headers are what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
24833,9,2,the author basically organizes this article into four main sections first there is the introduction next is a little bit of history on how these things form after that it talks about the negative affects these pieces of debris can have lastly it talks about what organizations are doing to try and clean up this space mess
24834,9,2,the author first opens with an introduction that grabs your attention he then explains how since the start of space exploration years ago debris has been caught in space orbits from events such as rocket launchings and satellite collisions he talks about different ways that it can make it into orbits and also the size of the debris and the speed at which it travels he then heavily emphassizes the importance and seriousness of the matter talking about how dangerous the fragments can be he concludes with the belief that enough public concern for the build up of space trash will cause space agencies to begin looking for a solution
24835,9,1,he first explains what space junk is and where it comes from then he tells you more facts about it
24836,9,0,he tells what space junk does then he gives examples to explain
24837,9,2,the author organizes the article with first giving us an intresting statement and then introduces the term 'space junk ' next the author explains just what space junk is and the harmful effects it can have the author then backs his claim by giving examples from history of previous satellites and other objects that have posed danger to astronauts then the author closes with explaining that any size of space junk is a potential danger and lists a few more examples from the past that have occoured and what is being done to help the effort
24838,9,1,the author breaks it down into three small sections making it easier to understand
24839,9,1,they start out by grabing your attention with having you get active by looking in the the sky to see maybe a comet then after that they say its a tool bag this then kinda has your mind wondering why is there a tool bag out there and how did it get out there after that they proceed to tell you about all the stuff that can be put into space that can be very harmful
24840,9,1,the author organizes the article by dividing it into individually subtitled sections they began by introducing the topic them gave information and finally concluded the article
24841,9,1,the author organizes the article by making interesting headlines for each paragraph by doing this the author has made it easier for the reader to follow along with his story
24842,9,0,they start with some history about space travel then go to how its not good to leave space junk in outerspace
24843,9,2,the author organizes the article by sections he or she has an introduction a what is space junk section a crash course section and a little bits but a big deal section in each section he explains the topic theme of the title in a more clear and better way
24844,9,2,this article is organized into secctions or topics with certain things only talked about in each section also in each section it can contain multiple paragraphs although still speaking roughly about the same idea such as in paragraphs 6 and 7 of crash course these paragraphs both talk about dead satelites except paragraph six talks about collisions and paragraph seven talks about the crashes and its effects on the astronauts and their ships
24845,9,1,he organizes it by first explaining what space junk is and than going into detail everything that happens to satellites and space crafts if they happen to hit or get hit by space junk
24846,9,1,he first tells us about the history of space stellites then it goes to how older satellites have crashed and are now dangerous to astronats and how they can avoid those dangers
24847,9,0,the author organizes the article from general to specific as the article progresses the information becomes more specific and more detailed
24848,9,0,that space junk is bad
24849,9,2,the author organizes the article by first catching your attention with the introduction then the author begins to tell you about some history about sattelites next the author explains that space junk makes a crash course for spacecraft finally the author concludes his or her article by explaining how small debris can cause major damage on spacecraft
24850,9,2,the auther organizes this article in an outline form giving his thesis 3 topics what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal and details within the three topics
24851,9,1,the author used a few techniques with the organization of this article in the intro paragraph humorous matter was used to grab the reader's attention this person also used subtitles for the paragraphs in the article to organize his her ideas and keep everything in a good flow
24852,9,0,it is ni a finse
24853,9,2,the author of the article 'orbiting junk' organizes the aticle into subsections based of the specific nature of the information that follows the sunheading for the section 'what is space junk' gives some background information on past space launches but focuses on the debris left behind when the missions fail living so called 'space junk' 'crash course' describes the collisions that can occur in outer space lastly 'little bits but a big deal' describes just how big of a deal the microdebris is in outer space at the speed these particles are moving at they become a hazard to all in their vecinity the used of these subsections allows the reader to better understand and follow the article 'orbiting junk'
24854,9,0,he gives good detail
24855,9,0,he starts off with a shock and then gose on how space junk began
24856,9,1,first the author talks about seeing a tool bag in the sky than the author gives background history of space junk than he or she explains why it is a big deal
24857,9,2,tehy start by talkin about space junk and how it got there next they talk about how satellites could crash to earth and last they talk about even if the junk is small it can still do damage
24858,9,0,at first he starts off all excited then he gets serious and tells us the harmful stuff that happens and why it happens and how they are trying to prevent it from happening
24859,9,0,he organizes this artice base off the domino effect if one of these events never happened none of these wouldn't happen
24860,9,0,the author organize the article by talking to nasa about the space junk
24861,9,1,it first starts talking about the atmosphere and satellites and then it talks about space junk then it concludes with a solution
24862,9,2,the author organizes the article by breaking the subjects up and talking about only one subject at a time other then talking about all tha subjects at once for instance when the author talked about 'what is space junk ' the author labled that section as 'what is space junk' and only talked about space junk in that section
24863,9,1,the author organizes the article by simply talking about space and how there are satilte crashes then they tell stories about how satiltes and toolbags are left up there they end this article about how its a big deal and its dangerous
24864,9,2,he organizes it by first starting off with a bit of humor in the first couple of paragraphs but by paragraph 4 the author begins to take a more serious and informative role he starts of by defining space junk then leads into the cause of space junk by telling the main cause of it satellite crashes and then finally informs us of the dangers of the pieces left over from these collisions
24865,9,0,the author organizes the articles based on how things are rated another way they are organized is how they interfear with the satalight
24866,9,1,the author organizes the article by putting the information into categories
24867,9,1,he starts it out with a very interesting introduction that catches the readers eye the author then goes on to explain all the facts about what can happen with space junk it is then explained what space junk is and what it can do to space ships
24868,9,2,the author organizes the article into different topics to put out specific details that are important the different topics answer questoins instead of having everything run together in the paragraphs 'what is space junk' it tells you when they launched the first artificial satellite these different topics give you important information and is seperated to make us understand easier
24869,9,1,'the author organizes the article by putting it into sections explaining each individual statements or facts being collected ' he tells about 'space junk ' and 'how satelites can react or how it becomes cluttered '
24870,9,2,the author organizes the article by putting different topics within the article that emphasize on a certain area of relation for examples the section titled 'what is space junk ' focuses on the explanation of what space junk actually is and how it is created and the section titled 'crash course' focuses on the crash between a russian and an american satellite in february of 2009 and goes on to explain that satellite crashes are not the only source of space junk
24871,9,1,the author organizes the article into sections and topics keeping the article smooth flowing and easy to come back and re read if a reader needs to
24872,9,1,the author starts off by making the story seem interesting then they talk about more details on debri in our space
24873,9,0,he starts out by a fun and exciting title then he starts out saying hoe cool it is to know about the soviet union put the frist satellite in space
24874,9,1,the author organizes the article by splitting the information up into differnt sections
24875,9,1,the author starts with an interesting statment to catch the readers attention then after grabbing the reader the author gives information about space debris and different examples of problems astronauts and scientists have run into
24876,9,2,the author organizes the article by first getting the reader interested in the article 'grab your telescope look up in the sky it's a comet it's a meteor ' then the author decribes how 'space junk' is and created 'the objects themselves however are positioned hundreds of miles above earth far from elemsnts that would cause them to degrade or burn up ' followed by some effects the 'space junk' has had 'two communications satellites one american and one russian both traveling at more than 20 000 mils per hour crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth ' then the author closes the article by getting the reader to think about how the 'space junk' could be handled 'scientists are hard presses for an easy solution to the problem of space junk '
24877,9,1,he orginazes the article in order from what everything is to how it works and what happens with it
24878,9,2,the author organizes the article into sections to help the reader to better understand what the author's point is the auther uses 'what is space junk ' to explain what the trash in space is he she uses 'crash course' to give details on how space trash is made also he she uses 'little bits but a big deal' to show how space trash is very dangerous to astronauts and satellites
24879,9,2,by placeing diffrent titles in the article also by giving reason and supportive information based on the titles like space junk provides information about the junk in space
24880,9,0,the author organizes this article by separating different topics the author first uses a small paragraph to catch the readers eye to get them to want to continue to read the article one of the first topics provides background information on what the article is going to be about and what the problem being faced is the next topic being presented is about what has happened because of the problem the last section of information states what will happen if the rising problem is not fixed
24881,9,1,this author organized the article by making headings and describing what each heading is about
24882,9,1,the author organizes the article by breaking it up into sections each section dealing with some different about 'space junk'
24883,9,2,the author organizes the article in an efficient way he she begins the article with a phrase similar to what one has heard at least once in their lifetime he she makes it easier to relate to and it simplifies a very complex event the author then discusses the tool bag with a few brief paragraphs about the history of spacecraft one brief example is that he she stated that in 2009 one russian and one american communication satellite collided into each other causing numerous pieces of the satellite to begin orbiting earth once more after explaining what 'space junk' is and the history of space junk he she then discusses how to deal with it and what people are doing to help obtain this recent ordeal for future generations of space travel again he organizes this article efficiently and effectively to where it was incredibly simple to understand and identify with
24884,9,1,the author organizes this article by giving a passage a title which indicates the main idea of that passage then giving details and proof of the idea the author is trying to get across
24885,9,0,the author organize the article explaining the satellite that have been sent beyond earth's atmosphere and what happens when the satllite die
24886,9,0,the author organizes the article by little importance to great importance i think this because of the useing of trash and junk in this passage
24887,9,2,the article begins in a catchy tone to grasp the readers attention and allow the reader to ask questions that will soon be answered what is space junk provides a beif history that aids in explaining how all this floating space junk got realeased into earth's swhirling orbits now that the austhor has explained how and why the machinery came into space the author provides specific situations like the crashing of american and russian stalites to state how the main issue of potential damage lastley the author raises awareness of damaging space junk by stating the effects of flying microdebri that could damage expensive space craft
24888,9,1,the author organizes this article by braking up the information quite well his opening is right on the money by grapping attention to make people want to read this then slowly he starts to give basic information about satellites and spacecraft from later years after he goes on about the past he draws in some new information about the concerns about the space junk and how it is affecting earth in many ways the author organized this article very well and made it easier to read
24889,9,0,that we need to take care about all the things that are around me like space its really impotant to everyone in the earth
24890,9,1,the author organizes the article very well he she begins with an introduction that grabs the readers attention this is followed by various sections that are broken down by sub topics all of coarse somehow related to the subject
24891,9,1,the author organizes this article into question and answer format by asking the question he gets your attention and then goes on by answering it with supporting detail by asking 'what is space junk ' hes telling you what your about to read about he then goes on giving details to to the question giving you more information
24892,9,2,the author organizes the article by using headings for each section to show the reader what each passage will elaborate in the section 'crash course' the reader is given information on different satellite collisions in 'little bits but a big deal' the author examplifies why small pieces of broken satellites pose a big problem for fully functioning satellites the reader is able to use his knowledge from 'crash course' to comprehend the information given in 'little bits but a big deal ' the organization is logical with each section building on the previous one

25017,9,0,well ha starts by telling what he is writing abot then he go's into how it will effect space travil and many other things
25018,9,2,the author organizes this article into sections you start with the introduction then there is 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal ' this makes it easier to sort the information and to find a certain type of imformation faster and with greater ease
25019,9,1,he tells you from start to finish all you need to know about space junk sattellites and where they came from he says about the importance of space collisions and they can crash anytime into another satellite
25020,9,1,it goes from definition other information about satellites and them crashing such as the titles of each segment in this article
25021,9,1,the author gives straight facts and trys to keep it intristing by decribing the importance of space junk like in 1957 the soviet union lainched the first satellite the us soon after also launched a satellite
25022,9,1,the author tries to get your attention an starts explaining things from his observation he goes into explaining about what is the space junk and how everything gets out there
25023,9,0,the author goes from the not so bad things to the things that are more dangerous to our atmosphere
25024,9,1,he organizes it into small sections each with their own main point and supporting details all coming together as a full article
25025,9,2,he organizes the article into to different sections about space junk he starts off with an introduction he then explains what space junk actually is next he writes about the collision of space junk in outer space after that he discusses why even if it is in small pieces space junk can cause big problems he finishes the article by writing about solutions to the space junk problem
25026,9,2,the auther starts out with an interesting statment 'grab your telescope look up in the sky its a comet its a meteor its a tool bag 'this realy grabs your atinchon and macks you want to read more in to the article then the author gos righit in to exsplaning what space junk is and the author even gives a good back story to how space junk got started the author then goes on to tell of the searyos dangers that this junk poases in the way the author laes out this article it provids an oranized and thoutfal layout fore the reader
25027,9,0,the author kept it organize because he put it in good order so they can get the reader attendion
25028,9,1,the author organizes his article with the typical introduction body conclusion style but he also puts in sub titles the sub titles help to guide the reader's thoughts and keep information simple as they are reading the article
25029,9,2,first he uses an introduction to grab the reader's attention the pause in the question really does just this then he tells about space junk and what space junk is in the section called what is space junk he then tells about collisions that have happened including the one in february 2009 that he stated finally he ends it up with statements showing that space junk is a big deal and needs to be fixed he gives a comparison about dust in wind with the sandblaster he tells how nasa and others maintain catalogues of known objects he ends with telling that the problem is increasing and needs to be stopped
25030,9,1,the author organizes this article by opening it with a attention getter to get the attention of readers then the author goes on and explains what he is talking about they then explain what the causes and effects the problem has he gives an example of the problem to explain his theory of what is does and who it effects and he closes it with a fact to help the reader understand the causes of the problem
25031,9,1,the author organizes the article by introducing space junk he does this by telling the history of space junk then he goes on and tells the reader about the risk of space junk then he says how a little piece of sapce junk can be a big deal
25032,9,0,the author organizes the writing pretty well he makes it understandable for the readers to read it he outs his writing in cronalogical order
25033,9,1,by labeling what he is going to talk about before he talks about it
25034,9,1,he tells us about space history for example the race between the americans and the soviet union and the space junk that was put into space he then tells us about the dangers these pose and the difiiculties of geting ride of them he finalizes by telling us how this problum is increasing and the hope that the nations will take more mesures to fix the problum
25035,9,2,the main point of the article is about orbiting objects but the autor broke it down into three main parts the first part is describing that 'space junk' is parts of orbiting satellites and things that are no longer functioning the second part is to show that it is possible for satellites to collide causing even more 'space junk' the third part is to show how this 'space junk' may not seem like a big deal but it is and people are beginning to increase space exploration to look for answers
25036,9,1,they start with the big things that are in space like a variety of spacecreafts and then move to things like microdebris
25037,9,2,the author starts by gaining your attention making a questionable statement that urges you to read on he then begins to explain the history of space travel in the section titled 'what is space junk ' he then slowly moves on exaplining the dangers of space junk he does it in a polite yet demanding manner showing that it is an important problem he puts it into threee sections to make it easier to explain what space junk is and then explain the problems of it
25038,9,1,they orgainize it by explaining what space junk can and will do if you are not cautious about things that can be left up there they also answer any questions that a reader may have at the beginning of each section so you can understand it better
25039,9,2,the author organizes the article by introducing new ideas and then explaining them in the first paragraph he or she introduces the word 'space junk' in the following paragraph the authors explains what space junk is and also tells how these objects circle the globe in an uncontrolled orbit the next section tells how these objects in an uncontrolled orbit are dangerous
25040,9,2,the author organizes the article with subtitles he has all the separate information grouped into sections with labels stating what they are about the introduction is more exciting and then 'what is space junk' is more formal
25041,9,1,in his introduction he tries to grab the readers attention after that he states the facts about this serious problem next he raps up his story and tries to tell the reader that this problem is getting worse but people are involved to help stop this serious problem
25042,9,0,the article organizes the article by facts he she used certain facts about 'space junk' in a specific order that made sence
25043,9,0,the author starts with interesting material to important facts and conclusions
25044,9,1,the author puts everything in diffrent catogories and titles every category
25045,9,0,he organiszed it very neatly and had plenty of research in his thoery enough to make me understand more about it
25046,9,2,the author organizes the article into how the space junk gets into space then how the space junk can be dangerous because at fast speeds it can be very harmful next the author talks about how even though some of the bits are very small that is bad because then they can not be detected on a radar the author the talks about how scientists are trying to find ways to get rid of space junk
25047,9,2,the author organizes the article in four different ways first the author starts with extremely exclamitory statements to get you intersted in the first paragraph second the author gives you a history on the great space invasion then the importance of space junk third the author explains crash courses and the magnitude of crashes in space lastely he concludes what he has explained in the first three ways of discription and wraps up the article
25048,9,0,on my own opinion i think the author organizes the article well by starting with rhetorical questions and this gains attention to the reader and also the way he arranges his paragraphs by describing how the great space invasion and continues his article by giving the causes reasons how effects and conclusion this makes the article organization good and proffesional
25049,9,1,the author organizes the article from the introduction which is very enthusiastic to pull in his reader then he gives you a brief history on the matter he is talking about then to the matter itsself finally to how important this matter is to him and our earth
25050,9,1,he titles each paragraph the explains in good details on why the junk in space is dangerous it also catches the readers eye and makes them want to read more and more of it
25051,9,0,they explore the vast reaches of our solar system monitor atmospheric conditions and make global wireles communication possible
25052,9,1,in the passage the author uses titles to organize the article the use of titles alows for different materials to be seperated from each other and to group the alike material
25053,9,2,the author organizes the article with multiple sections each section describes the problem of space junk a little more to the reader the section titles 'what is space junk ' explains that space junk is the debris in spacve that are orbitting earth such as broken space capsules telescopes and satellites the section called 'crash course' explains that sometimes these objects crash into eachother because these objects can be traveling at speeds of more than 20 000 miles per hour they break into hundreds of pieces that each assume their own orbitual path the last section called 'little bits but a big deal' describes how big of a problem space junk is because these debris are traveling so quickly they can damage the most carefully designed spacecraft it also tells the reader that the amount of space junk is increasing creating more of a problem
25054,9,2,the author organizes this article very well he starts off by getting the reader's attention with rhetorical questions then he continues by explaining what space junk is exactly after that he tells the reader what can happen when satellites are sent up to space finally the author finishes by telling the reader how much of an impact this actually has
25055,9,2,th author organizes this article into sections each section further explains the issue or gives background information the author gives information on satellities and objects that can get lost in space and the effect it has on space travel
25056,9,0,the author organizes the article by telling you what space junk was and the way it occurs
25057,9,0,the author does a very good job by organizing his article he starts off in the introduction as a light tone but than gets more serious this draws the reader in and keeps the reader occupies the way the author orders the article occupies the readers mind
25058,9,1,the author organizes the article by explaining what space junk is what happens to the junk and last how much damage they can do
25059,9,1,the article first explains what space junk is then how it gets there next how dangous it can be and how it can get worse
25060,9,1,they explain the importance of space dabris an how it can effect the satellites orbiting the earth the littlest fragment can cause a big problem
25061,9,2,first the author introduces what space junk is then next the author tells about two satellites crashing in the section crash course then the author ends with the section little bits but a big deal
25062,9,1,the author first organizes the article with the introduction then into the second paragraph describing the details in the introduction paragraph the third gives facts and intresting details to inform people about the severity of space debris
25063,9,1,the author organizes the information in a way in which the reader can understand the complex topic first by giving information about the first satellites and objects were sent into space second by giving details about how space junk comes to be
25064,9,2,the author organizes the article by different categories such as what is space junk and crash course this makes it easier for the reader to read and identify what they are going to read
25065,9,0,well first he gets you in to it by the first paragraph than his tone changes it is organized preety well they got the paragraph space junk thats a interesting paragraph the aithor trys to bring you in this story
25066,9,1,the author organizes this article by starting with an attention grabber that makes you think because at first it makes no since he then goes on to explain it starting with a story about how the problem started to ending with why it is important to fix it
25067,9,1,the author organizes the article in a different way the author puts the article in three different sections or chapters
25068,9,2,he has titles and then talks about what the title was they also built off each other such as he talks about space junk then some of the ways some of it has gotten to space and what it does up there
25069,9,2,the author organizes the article in a way to help explain the problem of space junk thouroughly and make it easier to understand the author starts by grabbing your attention saying to look at the sky and see a tool bag paragraphs 1 and 2 the author then starts to explain the history of space junk and how 'the human race's great space invasion' started it all paragraph 4 next the different things that become space junk are explained by stating how 'the disabled object becomes a piece of high tech junk circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit paragraph 5 the author also shows the dangers of space junk by saying that 'bits of space debris present a very serious problem' because 'tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the the most carefully designed spacecraft' paragraph 9 finally the author tells how agencies are looking for 'an easy solution to the problem of space junk' this ends the article by emphasizing the importance of this problem
25070,9,1,the author organizes the article by different sections he has a topic then talks about the topic and does not get off subject
25071,9,0,it list thing in how they think it should be
25072,9,0,he makes he to weree he can under stand how and what junk is and how bad it is
25073,9,0,by creating several articles supporting the main idea
25074,9,2,the author organizes the article into four sections the first section 'orbiting junk ' acts as an introduction that hooks the readers interest making them want to read more about space debris and how it occurs the second section 'what is space junk ' goes into detail about what 'space junk' is and how all that waste come to settle into our orbit in the first place the next section 'crash course ' explains the dangers of dead satellites in the atmosphere and how they are at risk for collisions the last section 'little bits but a big deal ' relates back all the information about 'space junk' back to the reader explaining it's signifigance and why the reader should care
25075,9,2,the author starts out with an exciting yet almost comical opener it wasn't something i expected but obviously something i needed to know since it is currently a concern to government space agencies the second paragraph begins by giving us some background on what exactly this space junk is it tells us that there are objects positioned hundreds of miles above earth and some of them circle the planet indefinitely now once this piece of high teck space object 'dies' it become one more piece of junk added to space which makes a problem because now its circling the globe in an uncontrolled manner then it leads us into the crash course section explaining the now dead satellites have the risk of crashing into one another the effect of that happening now causes the problem of tiny little pieces of debris floating around all throughout space but those pieces are not the only debris that roams the atmosphere any object that are released into space become free orbiting satellites so are astronauts have to be very cautions while in space to be sure nothing is left out in the open the last topic the author touches on is how little things propose a bigger problem those little pieces are flying around at five miles per second that is pretty dangerous because when we send our spacemen up there if one of those were to hit the shuttle it could easily go strait through it or damage it to a certain degree that would only make their journey more difficult never fear though scientist have worked hard on a solution as to how they will keep track of all the debris and they ended up just giving them different code names and keeping a radar on them at all times that way they know the safety zones for whats good and whats bad
25076,9,1,it's basically like a debate and this was his side of things he got the information used to show that it is a problem out there or earth too like it said if it got into our atmosphere it could seriously do some damage falling materials all over could wipe out millions of people it's also not healthy for the enviroment of earth and space either the earth could have some more junk all over and if there is junk in pace then it could come really polluted up there who knows how much of our things is hurting everyone
25077,9,2,he starts with a grabber then he explains what space junk is then he talk about what happened in 2009 then finally starts talking about the little bits of trash in space
25078,9,0,the author organizes the article by using certain parts of history
25079,9,2,the author organizes this article by starting out by stating the problem and then moving on to the specific sections that describe different issues such as 'what is space junk' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' orbiting junk
25080,9,0,the author organizes his thaughts by putting them in order
25081,9,2,the author first starts out with an introduction which informs us of what the article is about the author then goes in to a sublevel which tells us of what space junk is the author says that it is stuff that is lost in space and becomes a free roaming satellite the author then goes into a different sublevel called crash course this warns us of what could happen when the space junk gets released the last sublevel is called little bits but a big deal this sublevel tells us that space junk is quite small but it is very dangerous because it flies at a rate of 5 miles per second
25082,9,0,by telling what it is and then explaning how it works
25083,9,0,the author organized the article to give you supporting details an events showing the reader what ends up in space after so long then when it comes time to get around it the items are to small to detect on radar so they dont know everything that is floating around out there
25084,9,2,the author organizes the article in a understandable way he has the title 'orbiting junk' which tells the reader that overall idea then he has subtitles for when hes changing the matter of deatials on space junk for example his first subtitle is 'what is space junk ' in that passage he explains throughly to the reader what space junk is he also stays on topic for each section he writes about he dosen't get off topic he stays specific about what he writes about
25085,9,0,it is just talking about junk and how it can be used
25086,9,1,the author organizes the article by having different headlines talking about the stuff that has happen or can happen in space
25087,9,2,first the author has an interesting introduction that really grabs a readers attention next the author describes what exactly is being talked about then the problems that the space junk form is talked about and previous incidents that have happened the last paragraph shows the reasons why it is important and how it is dangerous
25088,9,1,organizing an article in a way that the reader becomes interested is not always an easy task this author however did a great job in stead of starting off with bring facts about space the author decided to use a sense of humor that gets the reader's attention after this the author organized the article in a way that maximizes the education of 'space junk' before the article goes into the harms of it while in space
25089,9,1,the author of this article organizes this article by using different topics throughout the peice he uses headings when he changes thought as well these headings help to let the reader understand that he is changing topic and that he is keeping numerous paragraphs under the same topic he organizes this piece very well and keeps the work very consistant
25090,9,1,he uses deferent sections to organize the information and group it together there are 4 sections in this paper
25091,9,1,he organize this passage into many different descriptive parts each part telling parts about space and how the equipment in space is harmful
25092,9,2,the author organizes the article by placing information under a title of a section that applies to what is in the section for example in the section titled 'what is space junk ' he tells you what space junk is and how it is formed or created
25093,9,1,the author organizes the article by splitting up the topics he wants to cover if he adds a a title to the topic he wants to cover more people will be more willing to read them or even keep reading than if the topic was just all bunched together the author seperates his topics and explains what each topic is to help the reader understand the problem more easily
25094,9,1,the author organizes the article by informative sections each section has a specific topic the author explains to the reader he she breaks it down so the passage is more comprehensible
25095,9,1,first the author graps your attention then explains space junk and reveals its a big deal
25096,9,2,the author organizes the article with first an attention grabber such as 'grab you telescope' 'look up in the sky' 'it's a comet' 'it's a meteor' then the author gets a more serious tone because he is trying to make a point and let you know how dangerous 'space junk' is after this the author lets you know what space junk is and what a crash course is then he says that little bits can be a big deal and explains why and last he ends it with all of it is a serious problem
25097,9,1,the author organize this article by first telling us what he is talking about then he explans to the reader what he is excatly talking about the author then gose on to tell the reader what the effects of space junk are doing to space the author puts the article in cronagale oder for the most part
25098,9,1,the author supports this article by seperating the different topics with subtitals he seperates all the information into the following sections 'what is space junk ' 'crash course ' 'little bits ' and 'but a big deal ' by organizing the article in this way the author has made it easier for the reader to find the information he or she wants
25099,9,2,the author organized the article by putting headings for the different sections to give a better idea about what that paragraph or paragraphs are going to be about just as the author puts 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' which gives brief descriptions about each paragraph
25100,9,2,the author uses sub topics or titles if you will for many of his paragraphs these titles let you know what the following paragraph s are about for example 'crash course' lets you know that you wil probably be reading about satellite collisions the author does this through out the article by doing so he effective organizes his article
25101,9,2,the author organizes this article by sectioning it off into subcatagories such as 'crash course' or 'littlebits but a big deal '
25102,9,2,the author organizes the article by similar information together after the introduction the author uses a historical timeline of the space race to give the reader information about how we got there then the author discusses how satellites can become space junk the author concludes by discussing how the little bits of space trash can be harmful to our space research
25103,9,0,the author organizes the article by explaining at first about the past and when they first had found junk in space then he explained about how everything went wroong because of something so little
25104,9,2,first he grabs your attention with a exclammatory statement then proceeds to explain the main idea of the passage and tells you a little about satellites after he explains the main idea he goes a little more in depth and tells you what the problem is with having dead satellites in space lastly he explains that even the smallest space debris can pose a very serious hazard to a person
25105,9,2,the author organizes this article by putting different titles and sections when he is discussing a new topic like he put 'what is space junk ' to tell us more about what this term is and then he made a new paragraph 'crash course' so that he could explain what this 'space junk' is doing to us and what is happening around us i think that it was good he put it into different sections becasue it makes it less confusing and it helps us understand the different parts of the story better
25106,9,0,he organizes is very well and clearly spoken with questioning what peoples opihnion's are while learning more about the situation
25107,9,0,the auther organizes this article by importance it would be important to know what space junk is before you read the other paragraphs to know what happens to space junk
25108,9,1,the author first defines what 'space junk' really is for those that are unaware of what it is and how it gets where it is following 'what is space junk ' is 'crash course' this section of the article gives an example of when a dead russian satelite and a dead american satelite crashed into eachother 'little bits but a big deal' is the last section and gives the effects that some of these small pieces of debris can harm spacecrafts and even astronauts
25109,9,2,the author organize the article in order first he made the introduction appealing by writing 'it's a comet it's a meteor it's a tool bag ' to get the readers attention of what space junk is after he explain what space junk is by telling how all started then he explain how the satellites collide with each other and finally he explain the problems space junk causes to space craft and how are countries trying to fix the problem
25110,9,2,the author started the article with an attention grabber to spark some interest for the readers they then wrote about the last few decades of space exploration to help the reader understand how often and how much we as a species clutter outer space finaly the author talks about how much damge this 'space junk' can cause to better our understanding of what the consequences are of satalite crashes or other accidents in space
25111,9,1,she eplains it in different paragraphs and breaks it down to understand better of what it is and how it was created
25112,9,1,the author made the introduction a attention getter than he she made titles which was followed up behind by details
25113,9,0,the author organizes the article by building up the information about space junk and how it will effect futre spece exploration
25114,9,2,the author organizes the article by beginning with a few questions that may seem humorous in order to set a tone of interest in the reader as they begin reading the article the author then proceeds to change the tone for he rest of the article to assume a more serious demeanor since he wants to create emphasis on the danger of the topic the author after the introduction begins by defining what space junk is and how it occurs providing strictly fact or background information on space junk in order to provide an idea about what the article is basically about and to give the reader a rudementary understanding of the subject before the reader is subject to more information or opinions on the subject the author can then go more deeply into the effects of space junk and who is monitoring it and how it can be harmful to future space exploration
25115,9,2,the author organizes the article by using subheadings to talk about different subjects in the same topic for example one of the subheadings is called 'what is space junk ' in that section he talks about the type of objects circling around space in the subheading 'crash course he talks about satellites crashing they talk about the same topic which is relating to space junk but different subjects like how satellites crash
25116,9,0,first he explains what
25117,9,0,he starts it off with exciting statements so he can get the readers attention and then he starts goin into good detail about how the space junk can be a serious problem
25118,9,0,well he tells that space is full of stuff and what thr reader to know the improtantice of it all
25119,9,2,the author organizes the article into groups of paragraphs using bolded words such as 'what is space junk ' or 'crash course '
25120,9,1,the author organizes the article very neatly the author has the article divided into sections each of which has it's own purpose
25121,9,2,the article starts out with a catchy introductionby telling readers to 'grab your telescope ' the second paragraph goes right into defining what 'space junk' is and how it is harmful it then talks about how satellite crashed can create debris the article goes on to talk about the fact that the debris created cannot be detected if it is smaller than a baseball this means that it is hard for spacecrafts to steer clear of the debris the author discribes this as grains of sand being shots from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall
25122,9,1,the author organized this article by talking about space junk and how harmful it is to talking about crashes and how little things can be a big deal
25123,9,2,he starts out by explaining a small portion of the problem the author then goes in to describe what space junk is defined as so there is a better understanding of the problem the author goes on to state that all satellites will eventually crash into some kind of object at some point and how big of an issue it really is then the author describes that even though the pieces may be really small there is still a large possibility that it can damage the satellite and spacecraft
25124,9,1,the author breaks it down into smaller peices he has a whole paper but breaks it down into small secounds with sub titles with in those sub titles he explains more on that situation
25125,9,1,first the author uses a 'hook' to get you interested ten they give some background information on the topic including the year 1957 when the russians first entered space they then describe how mor debri is made and why it is a big deal these paragraphs are the main body they concludes by telling what space agencies are doing to find an answere to the problem
25126,9,2,the author organizes this article by explaining what is in space then going further in deatil and explaining history of space pollution and how it gets there then finally explains how just small pieces can cause damage forever the author went through that order to make it more understandable and to emphasize the problem to the reader
25127,9,2,the author organizes the article by topics the autor will start a new section by adding a title to inform the reader what it will be about the article on crash course is simply explaining the number of collisions made every year in space
25128,9,1,the author uses the last sentence from one paragraph to lead into the next paragraph in the last sentence of the first paragraph the author writes 'this space junk is currently of great concern ' then the title of the next paragraph is what is space junk the author organizes the paragraphs in such a way as to lead us onto the next topic of discussion
25129,9,1,the author organize the article by tellin what is space junk and how why its thier and what happens to th satilltes once it has crashed into another and then he axplain what it looks like in space once it has turn into microscopic peices and is orbiting around the solour system
25130,9,1,he has different sections for each big thing he is talking about he makes it easier for people to read and understand why the outer space is so important
25131,9,2,the author organizes the article by making titles for each section for example when the author talks about how space junk can crash into other objects in space the title for that section is 'crash course ' the author also starts off explaining what space junk is then moves on to tell the reader how it is dangerous and explains how big of deal it really is at teh end of the article
25132,9,0,the author organize it by the tillin them what to do once they grab the telescope
25133,9,2,the article starts with an introduction then explains what space junk is how it happens and why it is important to know about
25134,9,1,the author first grabs your attention in a light hearted way by doing a little conversation then he really informs you on the origin of how space junk came to be with 1957 soviet union launced the first artificial satellite which was soon followed by te first usa satellite then he explains how the space junk is affecting current space explorations and projects by the debris destroying high tech very expensive machines in space this was a very easy to understand way to read how over time a tiny piece of debre can become a monumental problem
25135,9,0,he organizes it like its a cause and effect essay
25136,9,1,the author organizes this article by first grabbing our attenion with the use of a seemingly absurd statement the nexplaining wh ythe statement is not absurd he then tells us the origin of space junk some incidents caused by it and the lingering porblem of space junk in chronological order
25137,9,2,throughout the article the author organizes each section by the general time of the action after the beginning when the autor captivates the attention of the reader the author begins to tell the reader about the first launching of space satellites and the particular elements of space science the author then begins to write about the relevance of space debris to now followed by any solutions that have been brought up in the past years
25138,9,2,the author divides the article in to 4 sections first is draw the attention of the reader us the second section is to identify what space junk is and what the article is about the next section is about how satilites crash and what happens after the problem occurs last he exsplains why the problem is a serous matter and what scientists are doing to fix the problem
25139,9,2,the author organizes the article by going in order of importance or relevant information the author first explains what space junk is by giving the reader a brief overview of the definition and history of spacejunk next the author discusses how space junk can come about explaining that dead satellites may ultimately mulitply into a mass amount of space junk if said satellite crashes into another dead satellite finally the author stresses the importance of the dangers of space junk stating that any microdebris smaller than the size of a baseball can go undetected this undected microdebris may pose as a serious threat to space travelers because the microdebris may cause harm to the spacecraft
25140,9,2,the author starts by making a simple statement than he explains what 'space junk' is and how it cause our earth many problems in the third sections the author explains crash course which is uncontroled satellites that collide with each other causing pieces of debris to fly through space in his final section he explains that even though the problem is small its still a big deal the paragraph explains a small fragment travling at the speed of five miles per second can cause serious damage which is followed by the auther saying that the problem is increasing the whole article explains and show more information to us to better understand
25141,9,1,the author puts everything in sections so that it is easy to understand
25142,9,1,the author organizes this article by telling what space junk is then how it effects and other things such as satellites also the author gives examples to help compare what it is like for a small piece of debris in space smashing into a satellite one example from the article to give us an idea of what it is like in space like if a grain of sand were blowing in the wind vs a grain of sand chipping paint off of a wall
25143,9,0,by explaining diferent problems and courses
25144,9,0,he organizes it with a narrative prompt and an essay to go with it
25145,9,1,right away the author grabs the reader's attention but shortly after that she becomes serious she starts off by explaining what 'space junk' is and what kind of 'junk' we have floating around in space she provides the background information to help us understand the rest of the article she next tells us the damages done in the 'crash course' section in the end the author expresses to us how little particles can cause the most damge
25146,9,0,he makes it exciting at first then settles down and gets serious about the satellites and how important they are and how dangerous it is if they hit stuff
25147,9,2,the author organizes his information by organizing it by the topic or incident it pertains too for example they sort all the information about the satellites' collision of 2009 into a paragraph titled 'crash course ' also they title the paragraph telling the reader exactly what this cosmic debris is in a paragraph title 'what is space junk '
25148,9,0,they explore the vas reaches of the solar sistem monitor atmospheric conditions and make global wireless
25149,9,2,first the author grabs our attention with his first statements by acting as if he's telling you to look in the sky next he uses one paragraph to sum up just the topic of his article after his one paragraph he decides to tell you more information by organized sections the first section tells you what space junk is so you can know what he means when talking after you have realized what space junk is he goes on to give a example on what can happen with space junk when he trys to tell you of how small things at a fast pace can be dangerous he tell you about that in the next article basically the author uses two beginning statements one paragraph and 3 sections to explain and organize his concerns on space junk
25150,9,1,the author uses an interesting introduction to catch the reader's attention then he breaks down all the omportant things about space junk he emphasizes the importance of how dangerous space junk can be
25151,9,1,the author organizes the article by using different topics at each paragraph and by explaining why each are different at each paragragh and how each differ and rise in each paragraph it also talks about the problems that each face and how to overcome them
25152,9,2,the author organizes this article in such a way that answers a question that a reader may have once they gain new information in the previous section or paragraph for instance in the introduction we learn the term 'space junk ' the next section of the article is titled 'what is space junk ' the next title 'crash course ' helps to show what has caused this issue of space junk the next section 'little bits but a big deal' addresses any doubts that the reader may have about space junk being a true issue this organization makes the article easy for the reader to read and comprehend
25153,9,1,he organizes his article in sections each section is in order explaining the last this allows a reader to not get lost
25154,9,0,each paragraph fits in with the next one
25155,9,1,the author starts off by giving us a attention getter then telling us about the history of space travel then giving us some statistics about crashes and teeling us about how its a big deal to lose small things in space a baseball size space junk is enough to damage a space craft then they give us the ending
25156,9,1,the author organizes the artical by explaining each fact at a time what it is or means and why it should be such a concern for example what is space junk the author answers the question and gives strong details doing so from there the real reason the person wrote the article becomes rather clear it's a freaking serious issue i mean just image a grain of sand going 5 miles a second how many seconds does it take to drive five miles in a car better yet walk i wouldn't think one second even though that would be pretty awesome
25157,9,1,the author puts it in order as he first explains what 'space junk' is then explains how it causes problems this is through how they put 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal' in the order they are in
25158,9,2,the author organizes the article very clearly the author seperates the article into pieces and gives a titles for all of the new topics the author is generally just trying to get the reader to understand the meaning of 'orbiting junk'
25159,9,2,the author starts with a simple introduction that begins to lead the reader into the article after the introduction the author begins explaining what space junk is in case the reader does not know the author wants to make sure the reader understands the term and knows what he is referencing to the the author gets into describing how dangerous space junk can be he or she explains how satellites have 'the risk of colliding with each other ' the author also tells of the dangers of the small debris that results from the collision he or she tells the reader of how these tiny fragments can result in serious damage and in the end of the article the author emphasizes that the problem is becoming worse and that space agencies hope to solve the problem soon but haven't come up with a solution yet
25160,9,2,the author organizes the article into three different subtopics that all have something to do with the main topic of the article in the first section he talks about space junk and what it is in the second section he talks about satellites that crash into each other and creat space junk and in the third section the author describes the size and effect of space debri
25161,9,1,the author organize's the article first telling you what is space junk because some people dont know then telling you the dangers of crash cource the last thing the author talks about it the little things that cause a big problem i think the author did a really good job organizing the article giving the reader alot of information that they might have not known
25162,9,1,the author organizes the writing with sub headings that explain what point she is going to talk about next
25163,9,0,with humor and facts
25164,9,0,the author organizes the article in order from least important to most important he starts out first by telling when poeple first send things to space then he goes into detail about the harmful space debris floating around
25165,9,0,he backs up all of his details this was a very intrestng article to read
25166,9,1,the author goes from grabbing the readers attention with the introduction to explaining exactly what space junk is the author then explains examples of how space junk is created and that it creates little bits of debris then in the final paragraph the author explains the threat that these little pieces of debris offer to our spacecraft
25167,9,2,the article starts out by grabbing you attention and introduces you to the term 'space junk' then it explains what space junk is and starts talking about satellite crashes it then moves on to talking about the smaller things in space and concludes with how space agencies are trying to fix the problem
25168,9,2,the author first grabs the reader's attention in the introduction by including humor he then proceeds to include factual evidence and history to help prove his point he organized the paragraph into four sections each including a different point this lets the reader know what a certain part is talking about without having to read the whole thing for examble in the paragraph titled 'what is space junk ' the author defines the term and lets the reader know about space junk
25169,9,2,the author organizes the article by first explaing what space junk is by calling the first section 'what is space junk ' then the author explains what could happen and why it is a big problem in the sections 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal ' the author's article ends well explaing what scientist around the world are trying to do about it
25170,9,2,the author organizes the article by using different headings to inform the reader in the best way possible for example the author starts with an interesting opening to grab the readers attention the author then starts witht he heading 'what is space junk' and informs the reader with information about what space junk is the author does this with the other two headings as well to make it easier for the reader to understand his points
25171,9,2,the author organized this article from start to finish he or she had an interesting opening sentence from there they start out with how space exploration started and how the debris got there they went on to explain that debris is a big problem and we are trying to get rid of it but it still continues to grow
25172,9,2,the author first starts out catching the eye of a reader and started to make the reader think about what the passage will be about then the author tells facts and statistics about the space and how space junk can effect the people living here most of the passage is to explain things that might happen or what might be in space that and harm people of the world
25173,9,0,he orders the article from not so important to realy impotant
25174,9,2,it is in sections and it is alot easier to read when its in this form of way the author also give a great amout of detail in this article especially in the 'what is space junk' it tells you what it is when it is mad and where it even came from
25175,9,0,the author organizes this by putting the subjects into different paragraphs
25176,9,0,he organizes these paragraphs by telling interesting stuff about outspace
25177,9,0,the author makes the article an attention grabber once he has the readers attenchion he moves on to the more important facts the author makes sure the readers know that space has many dangerous things out there
25178,9,1,he puts in different sections to help you understad it better

25180,9,2,the author uses an interesting introduction to get the reader's attention then he or she tells us what a little bit about the topic and what 'space junk' really is then the author goes on to tell us that crashes are a big deal and cause debris finally he or she tells us more about space junk even though they are small space junk and debris is a serious matter
25181,9,2,he organizes it by using a itroduction to grab your attention then in the section 'what is space junk ' he decribes the problem with salalites that are not used anymore and about little debris then in the section 'crash course' he describes how dangerous these microparticles can be to space shuttles and satalites
25182,9,0,scientist are hard pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk
25183,9,0,the author organizes the article in chronological order and order of importance from explaining how space junk can be very dangerous to satellites eventually crashing into one another and a lost tool bag in space
25184,9,2,in the beginning the author makes sure he catches your attention with an excited attitude by using explination marks and so on the second section gives us facts and an idea of what 'space junk' is it explains to us a little background information about the subject the paragraph labeled 'crash course' helps support the intire article by allowing us to read history about past expieriences with 'space junk' 'little bits but a big deal' summons up the intire article it tells us why 'space junk' is a problem to the atmospehere and that they have yet to find a solution
25185,9,2,the author organizes the article by first grabbing your attention with a familar statement then indroducing the reader to the topic with background indformation 'what is space junk' informs the reader about the first satellite going into space after that the author gives support to let the reader know what happens because of space junk with the paragraph 'crash course ' in the end the article is summed up by stating that space jumk is harmful the author stuck to their porpose for writing the article and successfully provided facts to compliment the topic
25186,9,2,the author organizes the article by including an intro body and conclusion also the body is separated into three parts which all talk about different issues with space junk the first part of the body is used to define space junk and give the reader an idea of what it is the second part is used to show how satellites crash into each other a lot finally the last part is used to describe how space junk can be very small but still cause problems
25187,9,0,telling the dangers of space
25188,9,1,it goes in sequence starting with what orbits around the earth then it tells us about what is orbiting around the earth it then tells us that eventually everything in the outerspace will collide and it will hit the earth and explode into little pieces
25189,9,0,this is organized by the background information on the story which was how the satellite was built and many other things like that
25190,9,0,by naming every type of problems that can go on up in space
25191,9,0,the author is organized and has very goood supporting details that are true
25192,9,1,the organization is from past to present he first tell you about the orbiting of space an what is out thier then he calls it junk because sometimes the stuff they lost or put in space becomes very dangerous to the planet but no one knows the reason why because if you tell people the truth they wouldnt know how to handle it or how to act when you tell them some people over exzagerate the problem and cause all kinds of confusion space is a dangerous place to enter and play around with there is no gravity or oxygen to provide unless your on a spaceship most times space ships are not even safe some people can not handle moving slow or seeing things they have never seen before he was telling about the spaceship that was first launched in 1957 by the soviet union but it was artificial and the the united states followed suit whicha began the human race's great space invation thing like that causes confusion to everyone who can not ake it he also was giving information about the variety of spacecrafts their was and about the global communicaton an how they launch spaceships he kept it plan an simple and to the point how distrutive people are to their world and even to outerspace that is most dangerous to the earth in conclusion the fact that the matter is no matter how big small tiny or larger objects are it is so dangerous to people an the earth and it's surroundings it could cause major damage to people and the earth if it falls straight out from the sky
25193,9,0,the author organizes this article very well after finishing a paragraph while typing about a topic the next paragraph will be about that topic the author seemed to have wanted to explain the topics in the best way he good to get the reader to understand the author wants the reader to be concerned and not to be confused about anything he talked about
25194,9,2,the author uses titles to seperate sections into specific topics the titles the author uses are 'what is space junk ' 'crash course' and 'little bits but a big deal'
25195,9,0,that the space are som what alike and the differ times but yetthe problem is certain to persist
25196,9,0,telling people about the space jumk and realizing that people really care about this stuff and they should pay attention on whats happing with earth today

25198,9,2,the author organizes his article by topic the author uses sub headings within the article to tell the reader the change in detail such as the shift from 'crash course' to 'little bits but a big deal ' as a reader if the author did not use these sub headings the article would have made very little sense and seem very disorganized because the author used the progression of thought and subtitles it was very organized and easy to follow this is why the author organized the article by topic
25199,9,0,the author starts out using dialog then goes into all of the other things like what it is and how it was made

25202,9,2,the author organizes this article into four sections the first section 'orbiting junk' grabs the reader's attention and explains how 'space junk' is a concern in goverment space agencies the second section 'what is space junk ' explains how spacecrafts in the atmosphere can result in junk that begin to circle earth in an uncontrolled orbit 'crash course' explains why governments are concerned with the debris by illustrating a crash between satellites the conclusion 'little bits but a big deal' explains that the problem is only increasing and space agencies are trying desperately to end the space pollution and damage
25203,9,0,the author organizes the article by starting off with an interesting introduction and heading from there to the history and the serious things that people need to know about space craft and how it effects our solar system
25204,9,2,he organizes the article in a way to make it easier for the reader to read the way he has a name for each section like 'what is space junk ' and 'crash course' it just makes it easier to follow
25205,9,2,they begin the article with a catching introduction drawing the reader to the article with a humourous quote they add a twist to the quote 'it's a tool bag ' this is to foreshadow the story of the accident in which a toolbag escaped the grip of an astronaut during a repair on the internation space station the author proceeds to explain what 'space junk' is and how much of it is formed the article explains the dangers of dead satellites that can crash into each other it explains that with the increase of space exploration there will be a collective increase of space junk the author says that many people care about the space junk offering opposition to readers who are indifferent to this issue the author concludes that space agencies should work together to find a solution to this important problem
25206,9,1,the author tells you good true facts about space junk and also give gooddiscrption about whatcould happen in the futuer if we humans keep on creating junk in space
25207,9,2,the author organizes the article by separating different information into different sections for example one section labeled 'what is space junk ' only talks about what space junk is and explains the history of space junk
25208,9,1,the author organizes his article by the order in which it happens and by importance the first one 'what is space junk' second 'crash course' and third ' little bits but a big deal'
25209,9,1,the author organizes this article in a very clever way first the author describes what space junk is and how it comes about in space second the author gives examples of how space junk effects satelites and other space equipment lastly she explains the efforts of the various space administrations who want to reduce the ammount of space debris to show that they share the same concern for the safety of outer space just as we do
25210,9,0,the author organizes this article with chronological information bits and bits of information leading into the main topic of the story
25211,9,1,first the author has a good hooker that makes the reader want to continue to read the article then he she tells what the problem is that needs to be fixed following that are details of what has happened as a result of the problem at hand finally he she states what can and will happen from all the 'junk' in space
25212,9,2,the author starts the article with a phrase that might be said by a normal person and grabs their attention by saying something not expected when they say its a tool bag this first paragraph states what this is the next paragraph then explains what the space junk is and how it came about the paragraph says this when it explains the great space invasion then the section crash course explains the crashing of orbiting satellites and other orbiting junk such as a tool bag the last section explains how the junk is a big deal when it says the debris from the space junk can cause holes in the space ships we design
25213,9,0,he puts them in order by how they affect us
25214,9,2,first the author uses unusual statements to grab the readers attetion there is no way that anyone would expect a tool bad to be in the sky then the author gives some facts about space exploration and explains what space junk is after that the author gives a specific anecdote about how an american and russian satellite crashed this crash caused much debris and poses a huge fdanger to any future space travel finally the author explains how even very small space debris can be very dangerous to carefully designed spacecrafts
25215,9,1,i think that the author organized this article very well the introduction was very attention grabing it was dramatic and made me want to read more of it as it went on then he posses a question which led to a sort of history leason the author then gives you information about each topic using very good examples to give the reader a good idea of how something so little can be so harmful when it is at a high rated speed
25216,9,1,the author organize the article by fist informing the reader with fact about the main subject informing the read on the importance of satellites giving important details before coming with the conflict the author gave detail to detail about the problem withe 'space junk' then ended with how the problem is sopposed to be fixed that is how the article was organized by the author
25217,9,2,the author first states and observation found in space and then he tells you what it is and explains space junk next he tells you what this space junk can cause then he tells you why these little things are big deals and what they harm in space
25218,9,1,the author uses small titles and organizes the article from that
25219,9,2,this article is organized by topics in the beginning its exciting to catch readers attention and then it goes on to a more serious mood it tells you what 'space junk' is then tells you why it is important and dangerous after that it tells you about satellites and why they are a problem after that it talks about the size of the trash and the dangers of the speeds
25220,9,0,the author organizes the article by dates
25221,9,2,the author of orbiting junk organizes the article by topics these topics include what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal organizing this article into these catagories makes it easier to read and comprehend for the readers i believe it is a sufficient way to stay interested in the article and to make it easier to read
25222,9,1,the author organizes the article in a way that gives the reader backround information about the pollution and hints at its possible danger but doesn't reveal it until the last section when the author spills all of this information about the pollution at the end it has a bigger impact on the audience the reader is more likely to remember something if all of the key points are in one spot rather than scattered throughout the text

25226,9,0,the author estory avobe the information and chose the most important
25227,9,1,the author starts out by grabbing your attention with a few random statements he she then proceeds to describe what space junk is and some of the different objects that are considered space junk the author then goes into how space objects can crash into other objects and therefore make a million other tiny objects the author then talks about how these pieces are very harmful in the conclusion the author talks about how space programs are trying to come up with a way to get rid of space junk
25228,9,1,the aurthur organizes it with a hooking sentence then hits you with some facts of space exploration then tells you what the explorations leave behind and how dangerous and serious space trash is
25229,9,0,the author sorganize the article by making a statement and then giving you information on the statemant like for example 4 in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite now the statement to support what the author just said' the united states followed suit and thus began the human race's great space invasion
25230,9,1,i think how the author organize the article is that the author want to give out information about orbiting junk in space and put into to sections to inform the reader
25231,9,2,the author organizes the article by first explaining what the problem we face is in 'what is space junk ' then the author states how space junk was created in 'crash course' and lastly the author explains why space junk is a big deal in 'little bits but a big deal'
25232,9,2,the article 'orbiting junk' is organized into four main sections the introduction uses shocking statements in order to grab the reader's attention and then begins to more seriously address the facts and basics of space junk in the second section 'what is space junk ' following that the article really begins to stress the serious nature of the space junk problem section three titled 'crash course' relates both a story of collision on a major scale as well as how mere human error can create a notable problem the final section 'little bits but a big deal' is both a description of what even the smallest bits of space junk can do as well as a summary and conclusion to the article
25233,9,2,the author organizes the article in an effective way he starts off telling the reader what 'space junk' is then he goes on to describe the dangers of the 'space junk' an finally he says why its such a big deal
25234,9,1,he pust each part of the artical in its own chapter starting off not so serious and working his way down to how it can impact the earth and how its hard to work on stuff in space
25235,9,1,the authur organizes the article by starting it off with shocking sayings and paintings of vivid images of tools and tool bags flying through the air then the tone becomes more serious and the authur states more realistic facts in an effort to draw our attention down the page then the authur leaves us with a bit of a cliff hanger by stating that the problem of flying space junk will not end soon in fact it is getting worse around the world space agencies and nations a like are working together in an effort to clean up the junk
25236,9,1,first the author explains to us what space junk exactly is therefore explaining the first paragraph and title then the author explains how space junk comes to be from colliding ships and satellites then the author explains how that debri affects us down on earth
25237,9,1,the author organizes this article by topic he puts a catchy introduction first then follows up with explaining the different parts of space exploration in great detail he gives background information on all of the topics
25238,9,1,they orginize it with titles and subtitles they also put all similer information in one group
25239,9,1,in the introduction the author catches your attention with the thoughts of someone then the author goes into the the facts about how things got into space in the first place the author then goes into why its bad to have things in space then the author tells you why its dangerous and what will happen in the future with space junk
25240,9,0,the author makes it seem like space travel is really harmfull but people do it all the time
25241,9,0,he talks about all of the problems with space junk and its effect on humans and other things
25242,9,2,the author organizes this article according to what you know and how you learn something such as the first section is to grab you attention so you want to read more the second is to identify and explain what the topic is the third is to go more into depth about the topic and the fourth is to explain why you should care and the dangers of the topic it's organized as an informal persuading article overall
25243,9,0,he organizes it by placing what is used by humans and facts about the satilites and what goes on in space
25244,9,1,in the article there are other articles that go with it they are broken up in catigories and have there own titles
25245,9,1,the author starts off by keeping it simple where everyone can follow along easily then he starts a new heading where he then begins to state facts that explain how space debree is dangerous and polluting space after the new heading he just uses paragraphs to finish off his article
25246,9,0,the autor organizes the article by starting with events that happened first such as saying ' in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satilite ' also stating ' two communication satilites one american and one russian both traveling at more than 20 000 miles per hour crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth '
25247,9,1,the author organizes the article by introuducing you to what the article is about then it tells you the problems about space
25248,9,2,he uses them in order on which questions would apear if someone doesn't know why a tool bag would be in space or wants to know what space junk is the auther tells them right off the bat the auther talks about how they collied and make smaller pieces which explains the crash course paragraph it then talks about the little pieces that break off which is the purpose for little bits but a big deal each paragraph has a purpose and they are all in order
25249,9,1,the author starts with an opening statment to get the readers attention then he moves on to the topic sentence in the introduction to say what the article is about the author uses headings to seperate the article into parts after that the author uses body paragraphs to explain what space junk is and explain the problems it could cause finally the author tells what is going to comtinue happening for the conclusion
25250,9,2,he orginizes the passage by first introducing what it is then moves each part into detail about a particular object for example it starts by asking what is space junk and telling us all about it then it goes into what causes it or as it is called crash course and last he tells how he feels about all the space junk in the last paragraphs called little bits but a big deal
25251,9,2,he organizes it into several sections each section being about its own topic one being about collisions and how space debris appears another being the potentioal problem that it could inflict then another about the hisory of space exploration
25252,9,2,he organizes the information by a description of what it is about the effects and how dangerous it can be the titles in the article are clever and that gives the reader an idea of what's to come
25253,9,2,the author organizes the article by giving a good start in the beggining starting off eith an retorical question and then following with a serious manner problem the author then explains what apce junk is and how dangerous it can be then it continues with the dangerourous crashes in space crashes then create harmfull debris then at the end explaining that little bits are big deal to the earth
25254,9,1,the author in this article is very good about how he or she wrote it the author started with an introduction that gave you a main idea about what your going to read then the author made sure you had the history down before you went any further and after that gave you the main problems with space research overall it is a very well put together article
25255,9,2,the author organizes the article by first talking about all of the space parts that are orbiting around the earth to help the reader better understand how many things are in space next the author describes how dangerous leaving 'high tech junk' in space can be the author gives an example of the emphasis put on the strength of this debris by saying ' instead of two disabled satellites there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space the author continues on by trying to keep the reader interested in how much of a problem the microsatellites can be in 'little bits but a big deal' the author finishes by saying the problem is still increasing instead of being fixed
25256,9,1,it starts off by stating what 'space junk' is then it gives some history like back in 1957 the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite then it talks about the risk of satellites running into eachother causing pieces of that to fly out into space space debris is a very serious problem they can be powerful enough to creat disastrous holes in an object moving through space
25257,9,2,the author organizes the article by first explaining what space junk is which he says are pieces of sattelites that get stuck in orbit he explains how the junk comes to be and what happens to it he also gives information on how space junk comes to be it is caused when sattelites break or run into eachother lastly he describes the bad effects space junk have he says all of the upcoming space exploration is increasing the amount of space junk which is cluttering the atomsphere he says the new amounts is making space travel more difficult and everyone needs to work together to limit the amounts
25258,9,2,the author of this article organized his work into sections he began with in introduction to help introduce the problem and catch the readers attention then he explained the basic history of what we have in our orbital in the section called 'what is space junk ' through 'crash course ' the author explained what the space junk does that makes it a problem to any space program finally he wraps up with his conclusion and explains how it effects us as a community and a planet
25259,9,0,the author organizes this article by the importance of each fact
25260,9,0,they narrow the artical to more specific points
25261,9,2,the author organizes in different subsections that he or she believes fit together i like this idea because sections like 'crash course' can easily be identified as the section where collisions are found
25262,9,2,the author organized this story into different sections the author first gets our attention with the introductions the author then gives us some background information on the history of space junk and how it can effect the earth next we find out how harmful this space junk really is it talks about the collisions of satellites and how they are harmful to earth finally the author tells us that once they have collided they are formed into little bits that are still a big deal it is hard for spacecrafts to steer clear of this tiny object
25263,9,2,the author organizes the article in little sections to highlight each thing you need to know about space junk like the first section what is space junk the author explains what space junk is and where it comes from the crash course section talked about two satellites colliding into each other the little bits but a big deal section talks about the hazards of microdebris floating through space and the increasing amount amount of space junk caused by commercial space travel
25264,9,0,i really dont understand the question you are aking me
25265,9,0,they talk about the history of satelites
25266,9,2,the author organizes the article in a very good way the introduction is first next we find out what 'space junk' actually is then it talks about how it is made when satellites collide and crash which causes it to form into smaller pices because everything breaks apart at very fast speeds
25267,9,1,the authour organize the article by folloowing from the beginning to where it talk about space junk secondly it goes from there to where it ends to crash of the course lastly it goes to big deals where it talkls about 'tiny fragments traveling at speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft'
25268,9,0,the autor put it in a order where the reader will know where to look to find information
25269,9,1,well he starts off as like in a excited tone but then goes into detail about how space junk jas came to be and made our solar system very very dangerous and how a lot of our satelites can be destroyed from these little pieces of debris moving at a high rate of speed
25270,9,2,the author organize the article by breaking each of the thing he want to tlak about into three little section like the first one is really just telling you about the junk the be in space and the second is talking about how you can crash why you in space if you dont have all control of your spaceship and the last one just talks about lilttle things that can fall from spcae and some people dont think that its a big deal but it is
25271,9,1,the author organizes the article by not just putting ideas in paragraphs but also puts them in groups with titles for that paragraph or group of paragraphs
25272,9,1,by using subheadings to organize what the following paragraph will be about the author categorizes information and puts them in paragraphs with a like topic
25273,9,1,the auther organizes this articale by starting this article with a shocking statement to make the reader want to read the article after the auther has the readers attention the auther uses facts to show the dangers of space junk and why it is a big deal
25274,9,1,he explains what it is what happens due to that space junk and then some facts about what has happened
25275,9,2,after the introduction the author defines what they are talking about the first section is 'what is space junk ' in this section the author talks about what space junk is and how it is formed the second second is called 'crash course' and it is about the dangers of the space junk and then the author transitions into a related topic tiny bits of space trash the author talks about the dangers of even a small bit of space debris the author concludes by talking about the current state of the problem of space junk and intiatives to try and solve the problem of space junk throughout the entire story it is a progression setting the story up defining terms and talking about how they are formed what role they play what damage they can do and finally ways to stop the problem
25276,9,2,the author starts with a catchy introduction that is an allusion to a common phrase from 'superman ' he she continues on with explaining in general what space junk is and how some of it got into space 'crash course ' the next section of the article explains in more detail of two incidents in space that created space debris a crash and a dropped tool box finally the last few paragraphs explain why the little peices of space debris have such an impact due to the high speeds at which they travel it also mentions why we should be concerened and how this problem if not solved quickly will become an even larger issue due to more and more space travel in the near future
25277,9,2,the author organizes the article by introducing the concept of space junk in a fun way but quickly gets serious as the articles pass he explains space junk by reviewing the space age then getting to the matter at hand he states that space junk is mostly created by satalite collisions in one article and also stating that microdebris from the space junk is very harmful to astronauts the author explains the problem very well through a series of paragraphs
25278,9,1,the author grabs the reader's attention with the opening paragraph the following sections are used to explain what exactly the author is relating to you the author provides headings to give you an idea of what you will be informed about next
25279,9,2,the author organizes the article by seperating it into sections of what happens and what they do to help the sections are the introduction what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal these sections tell us exactly how harmful space junk is and how it is caused
25280,9,1,he starts off the article with interesting statements that shock you into doing it once he realizes you are paying attention he then starts to tell you about the history of satellites the author tells you about some crashest that have happened to keep you interested and then goes back into important facts that you need to know such as how the smallest things can turn into the biggest problems
25281,9,1,the author goes by topics and provides facts and sometimes his own opinion in the paragraphs he starts out some of the paragraphs with quesitons and then he answers them he backs up all of his paragraphs with very well used information
25282,9,2,the author starts off by explaining what space junk is then explains how it can cause minor problems along with serious ones and why people should care the tool bag is one of the issues also the author gives information about a solution and how the problem is only getting worse
25283,9,0,because they tell all about the space stuff
25284,9,1,she puts subtitles to try to divid the importance of space
25285,9,2,the author organizes this article into catagories and paragraphs each section in the story has its own signifcance to the background knowledge and effects of space junk the section titled 'what is space junk ' refers to what it really is and how long its been in our orbit
25286,9,0,he starts with what it is about then tells some of the history about it then tells what is going to happen if were not careful
25287,9,0,farily decent
25288,9,2,the author begins with a catchy lead in then he dives into the real issue space junk he then gives us a brief over view of space junk history and nasa history he then explains how 'dead' satellites are a major issue and what they can do to one another he also explains other forms of debris then he finally comes to his point why its a big problem and how we are trying to fix it
25289,9,2,the author starts with a lucrative introduction and moves into the background information once the cause of the junk has been defined the author tells the major causes of debris such as satellite crashes and accidents by astronauts it then goes onto describe how and why we need to fix this very serious problem that we have caused by careless space exploration the author then comes to a conclusion that the problem will ensue despite efforts to contain it
25290,9,1,the author arganizes the article be having differernt titles in the one article the author does it by the importance of how it should be informed to others
25291,9,1,thos author organizes the article by introducing the problem the he or she provides background information on how this problem occurs the he or she goes into explaining the dangers and how to prevent them
25292,9,2,the author organizes the article by giving each different section a title like what is space junk or crash course to give you an idea of what the section is about
25293,9,2,the author starts off by stating what he sees in the sky is nothing but a simple tool bag then he shoots right into detail about space junk the author explains to us that space junk is more of a problem than we might see it as he goes on by telling us how dangerous it could be and how it could occur then states that engineers are seeking and adding improvements to spacecrafts and spacesuits so they can withstand this 'space junk '
25294,9,1,the author organizes the article by starting off with an attention getter in the introduction after the introduction the author startst to use a serious tone with the reader he starts to define how the problem started the author then goes through and starts to emphasize the things that you read in the article by the end of the article everything that you have read makes more sense because you everything has been defined previously in the article
25295,9,1,the author organizes the article in different sections to seperate the topics each topic has a heading telling what it is about
25296,9,2,the author organizes the article by first trying to get the reader's attention he proclaims things such as 'grab your telescope ' then the author begins to define how objects released in space will always orbit the planet even after they have malfunctioned this creates a 'great concern to government space agencies around the globe' the author then addresses the topic of how space debris is created for example when 'two communications satellites both traveling at more than 20 000 miles per hour' crashed they produced hundreds of pieces of debris next the author informs the reader of how these tiny pieces can be very harmful and dangerous in addition to the danger they pose 'the problem is certain to persist ' last the author includes facts on how this issue will worsen
25297,9,1,he orgonizes it in sections by doing this if a reeder wants to look back he can find a statement much easyer
25298,9,2,the author first grabs the reader's attention by using a line from a superman quote he she then turns into serious mode and talks about space explorations and how objects can be detached from an exploration then the author gives an example of a crash in space between two satelites that ran into eachother and made milions of tiny satelites the author concludes the article by talking about what scientists can do to prevent space junk in the future
25299,9,1,the author organizes the article by first describing what is space junk space junk is a variety of spacecraft including space capsules telescopes and satellites have been sent beyond earht's atmosphere then the author simply tells about all the things that are included in the sapce junk
25300,9,2,the author organizes the article into four sections the introduction which introduces the reader to space junk with an anecdotal occurence 'what is space junk ' which describes countless objects orbiting the earth 'crash course' which descibes the events of satellites and other orbiting objects crashing into eachother and 'little bits but a big deal' which explains how serious space junk is and what problems it can cause
25301,9,0,the author organizes the artical from least important to most important
25302,9,0,the author organizes the article with several different pieces of writing put into one it makes this article a good read
25303,9,2,the article is organized by certain topics each paragraph is about something specific for example the 'crash course' paragraph is mainly about collisons of the 'space junk ' 'little bits but a big deal' is about how smaller debris moving at a high speed can still cause a lot of damage
25304,9,0,the way he got everything organized is like he got everything label and know where exactly where too go
25305,9,2,the article follows cause and effect organizational pattern from the prelude in the introduction it moves onto a description of the history of space travel furthermore it descbribes how a celestial satellite becomes 'space junk ' in the last part of the article entitled 'little bits but a big deal ' it explains how the microscopic pieces of loose material up in space can become a dangerous problem to travelling satellites from the cause of space pollution to the effect of dangerous environments in space travel the organization helps to understand the nature of the problem at hand furthermore the article is divided into labeled sections describing the common themes for the compilations
25306,9,0,the author ordanizes the article by cause and effect he says that we send stuff into space but when we do some of the stuff becomes free flowing junk in space
25307,9,2,the author first tells us a statistic about space junk being very harmful he then tell us about the history of satellites and he tells us about how the term 'space junk' was first talked about the author now talks about satellites colliding with each other and creating all of this debris now he finally tells about how much of a big deal this matter is in our world
25308,9,1,the auther organize the article in different sections about what he is talking about and also each section has different information about the topic he talks about that is how he organizes it in the article
25309,9,2,the author organizes the article by first grabbing our attention to read the article then he she tells us mainly what the article is about concluding why the first title into the reading is 'what is space junk' after reading that information we now can be educated with negative effects of satellites finally in the conclusion we can relate the satellites to our environments today
25310,9,1,the author organizes it in the same way i think i would if i was writing a paper on this topic to start off the article the author uses a funny statement ot try and drag the reader in as seen in the first two lines then he trys to inform the readers of the history of space travel and how the junk gets into space in the first place as seen in the second paragraph next the author tries to inform his readers about some of the major accidents that created alot of space junk he does this when he explains the instance of the two satalites colliding lastly the author tries to explain to the reader that the space junk may be small but it is very dangerous as seen when the author says that the bits even though they are small present a very serios problem then he ends the article by telling the reader of the fact that the amount of space junk is actually increasing
25311,9,0,he gives great reasoning and citing in all paragraphs
25312,9,2,he orhanized this article in to different section to help the reader understand what they are going to talk about next an example of this is the title what is space junk the use this to show that this is waht you are going to read about
25313,9,2,the author organizes the article by having four different sections of information the purpose of the first section is to grab the readers attention the second section gives background information on what space junk is and where space junk is located the third section informs readers about the risk space junk has on us it also informs the readers how the crahses take place and at what speeds they take place at the last section talks about why space junk is hard to stear clear of
25314,9,2,the author uses an introduction to grab the readers attention the use some humorous dialogue to get the reader interested and to introduce the topic of the article the following section goes into detail about the focus of the article by explaining what space junk is and what it becomes crash course gives real examples to ellaborate the dangers of space junk such as when the two satellites collided with one another the final section discusses the current situation and overall impact that space junk has by giving the example of sand being blown by a breeze of blown out of a sandblaster this elaborates on the damage that small pieces of space junk can do
25315,9,2,he organizes it in small sections that protain to what he is talking about such as what is space junk and crash course
25316,9,0,he sets it up as if he is going to tell a story and read it to you and he starts telling you facts about space and how all the stuff works
25317,9,1,the author organizes it by putting a subject above the paragraphs to let you know what those paragraphs are about it's like a book with chapters but in an article
25318,9,2,the author organizes the article very well he had the introduction and then he puts the different paragraphs into catogroies he explains what is space junk he tells you about crash course how the satellites crash and how it is dangerous to have alot of satellites in space the author also puts in a section about little bits but a big deal he is telling you that all the little things smaller than a baseball is difficult for a spacecraft to steer clear
25319,9,2,the author starts with a light hearted introduction then the author continues by explaining seriously what space junk is and the effect it has on space missions etc the author includes facts and dates about space missions themselves and ends with the hope of coming up with a solution for space pollution
25320,9,0,the author organizes the article by history and then to revenlent points to the subject of the article based on the other titles
25321,9,0,the author organizes the article by the littlest problem to the buggest problem
25322,9,0,the author starts out with the things that are not exactly that important and ends with things that are extremely important
25323,9,0,he talks about space jumk ant the great space race
25324,9,2,he starts out getting the readers attention by asking questions and having humor then they get more serious and start to explain what space junk is they also give information about statlites and the dangers of the space junk and satalites being together
25325,9,2,the author organizes the article into three different sections plus an introduction the introduction introduces the idea of space junk to the reader and the section 'what is space junk ' explains what space junk is 'crash course' describes how space junk is created and 'little bits but a big deal' focuses on small space debris
25326,9,2,by having subtitles in the article such as what is space junk crash course little bits and but a big deal
25327,9,0,throughout this article the author list various facts about space the author starts it like a conversation and then turns it into a factual article about space very entertaining i very much enjoyed it
25328,9,0,the author organizes the article by telling the reader about satellites first then going deeper into detail about all the junk that flys around in outter space the author explained this very well i thought
25329,9,0,the author organizes the article in a very eye grabbing way he strts out with some very enthusiastic comments to grab your attention once he grabs your attention he brings up the issuse of space junk he keeps it intresting though he also has facts to back everything up
25330,9,2,he starts out by just ecplaining what space junk is then he goes into detail about what it is and why it is harmful and why we dont need it up there
25331,9,1,the author orginize the article by adding facts of stuff that had happened in space it tells you how space junk got into the space and is now a big problem for satellites and space ships
25332,9,0,the author organizes the article by time he has it from one thing happening to the next in the order they happened
25333,9,2,the author oranizes the article first to catch our attention he then goes into information about space junk and how it is harmful after he talks about how dangerous crash courses are then he pursues to talk about how these things are little but a huge deal the author is a very intelligant an organized man the article was fantastic
25334,9,1,the author gives us detailed information about how satellites began and what happens to them if the would crash into another satellite that the space trash form that crash would fall to earth or it go destory another satellite like a sandblaser blasting paint off concret the tiny fragments would perice throught that object and possobly bring it down
25335,9,1,it talks about space and how the space junk is everywhere it also talks about it increasing becasue commercial space travel is the rise an more nations have undertaken space exploration
25336,9,1,the auther tell us every thing we put in space will come back and hurt us one of these days he thells us every thing that can go wrong i tink we should stop puting our crap in space
25337,9,1,he creates a organized paper of all the catagories he wanted to talk about it wasnt all cluttered together under one title he spaced it out
25338,9,2,he first starts off with an intriguing introduction thats main purpose is to grab the reader's attention he then goes in to a brief history of space exploration and then how space debris is made he then proceeds to give the reader multiple explanations on how space debris is harmful
25339,9,1,he caught my attention in the introduction then he slowly filled my head with interesting facts about space junk in in the fourth and fifth paragraph of this passage then in the last two paragraphs he talked about the seriousness about the junk in space
25340,9,0,he starts out getting the reader attention and the gradually gets into more detail explaining how harmul space junk can be
25341,9,2,the author begins with an exciting introduction to grasp the reader's attention and keep them reading then after the excitement is over he addresses the topic seriously and describes the dangerous of 'space junk' while explaining this the author divides different portions of the article by using sub headings such as 'what is space junk ' or 'little bits but a big deal ' these sub headings clarify the mainpoints for the reader and make the article easier to understand
25342,9,1,it grabs your attetion in the introduction it tells you a little bit of information about space exploration it tells about the risks of objects running into each other also tells how the really small particles of space garbage pose a big problem
25343,9,0,people always think that satellites are all controled in control however some of them are not and there are a great possible that the will ran in to each other
25344,9,0,the author organized this in a way that everyone can at least try to understand its not just a bunch of space talk or big words that someone would have to look up just to know what they are reading
25345,9,2,the author organizes the article by breaking it down into different sections the introduction tells what the rest of the article will be about then the author uses the titles what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal to talk about different topics under each topic the author explains the title
25346,9,2,the author starts each paragraph with a different topic relating to space and the specific problems involving space like the second paragraph which is called 'what is space junk' this paragraph is telling you what has been put into our space and what is making it crowded
25347,9,1,the author organized this article in a very specific yet unique style instead of combining the article into one the author put everything into a category one category can simplify the understanding of the text as the reader reading one category at a time helps with reading comprehension perhaps the author had no clue as to how to combine everything into one or had too much information to combine it all into one the first 'category' acts as an introduction while the second 'category' acts as the main story yes the author could have organized the article in a different way but he stood out and made the text easier to understand i strongly believe that the author did this to get the reader drawn into the story
25348,9,1,the author is talking about different facts in the article so there're different headlines for ever subject
27589,10,1,black this color could possibly make the dog house warmer
27590,10,0,white it will affect the doghouse by making it nice and fresh inside the doghouse
27591,10,1,white brandi and jerry would have to paint the dogh ouse white because the sun doesnt make alot of wite things hot cause on the data table it shows that the color white doesnt effect the sun alot since its a lighter color
27592,10,2,white white does not absord as much light as a dark er color making the inside of the doghouse not as warm as it could be in the experiment the lowest temperature average was white with 42 deg the next temperature was light gray with 45 deg after that it just goe s up higher
27593,10,2,black i would pick black this color will effect the dog house by keeping the dog house warm my support is that in the data t able it shows that the average temperature for the color black inside a g lass jar was 53 deg c and the lowest temperature was white and whites av rage data was42 deg c dark grey and light grey had a median of 48 deg c for dark grey and 45 deg c for light grey this shows that the black co lor would keep the dog the most warmest
27594,10,1,dark gray using dark gray would make the dog house an average of 48 deg c if you used black it would be too hot in the summer but if you used white it would be too cold in the winter and the reason why i didn't choose light gray is because the dog would most likely be in the dog house at night when it's colder and not so much during the day especially in the summer
27595,10,1,light gray by using this color for the doghouse it will have the perfect temperature inside the doghouse because it will be abou t 45 deg inside which isn't too cold or too hot and that might make th e dog happy
27596,10,2,white if the color of the dog house was white then the air temperature inside of it would be cooler than if the color was black the averge temp for the color black was 53 deg c and the average temp for the color white was 42 deg c the difference between them is 11 deg
27597,10,2,white white paint would keep the doghouse cool you know this because white had the lowest average air temperature after ten minutes under the lamp
27598,10,1,white it dose not absorb the light as much
27599,10,1,black i say it should be black first of all because lesser air will go inside the doghouse since its ah more darker color a nd pluz it has an average of 54 deg in average of heat inside a glass j ar
27600,10,1,dark gray the dog house will be hot due to the absorbst ion of heat from the color of the house this will help the dog stay warme r during cold nights and the winters
27601,10,1,white it will keep the heat out of the doghouse bec ause white reflects heat and will keep the doghouse cool i know th is because of how the white jar heated up the slowest in the experiment
27602,10,2,black black could affect the inside of the dog hous e because it will keep the dog house very warm so the dog won't get cold i think this is true because according to the data the average temperatu re of a black color was 53 deg c which was the high data and the average temperature for the white col or was only 42 deg c which is the low data and the black temperature w as 11 deg warmer then the white temperature so that means the black co lor will keep the dog warm
27603,10,2,black if they paint the doghouse black then the dog could sleep in it overnight because of the warmth the average tem perature of the black jar was 53 degrees while the white jar was on ly 42 degrees
27604,10,1,white dogs have a lot of fur to keep them warm so o n a summer day they want to cool down black is not a good chose because it asbordes a lot heat white does not the color white will affect the do g house by being less hot then a black dog house will be
27605,10,1,dark gray its would be about an average temperature it s not 2 hot or 2 cold
27606,10,1,dark gray dark gray might affect the doghouse because i t would warm up the dog without the dog getting to hot
27607,10,1,light gray this cler would keep the dog house cool and k eep a little warmpth in side
27608,10,2,black this color will keep the dog house warmer bec ause it has a lower albedo also in the experiment it had the highest of the average tempertures with 53 deg
27609,10,0,dark gray tgfyfgfgccghjhjhgcgtchfhjfgfcc
27610,10,1,white from the results i would pick white because i t was the coolest as in temperature that way the dog would be able to s tay in a place thats not to hot and it provide protection from the sun th e lighter colors absorb less heat other than the darker colors so it shou ldent be that hot so they should paint the dog house white or any other l ighter color but not the darker colors
27611,10,0,black it wont
27612,10,0,white the white color will be the best because it i s not as dark as black and white absorbs less heat than black the dog house will be about the same temperature as the outside with the white paint the showing results of white is that it collects less heat energy than the other darker colors
27613,10,2,black having a black doghouse would make the doghou se warmer on the inside in brandi and jerry's experiment using a black lid had an average of 53 deg c while the othere lighter colors had ave rages of 48 45 and 42 deg c therefore using black would be the best choice for a doghouse color
27614,10,0,light gray if the doghouse was black or dark gray it mig ht get to hot for the dog if it was white it might be to cold for the do g so i decided that ligh gay was a good color
27615,10,2,white the color white might effect the doghouse by causing the air temperature to be low in the summer since lighter colors obsorb less energy this is proven because a black lid averaged 53 deg c and the white lid averaged a 42 deg c wich is in fact much cooler than the black lid temperature
27616,10,1,white i choose white for the colopr of the dog hous e because that way it wont be so hot for the dog in the experiment brandi and jerry found the lighter the color the less sun it atracts
27617,10,1,light gray i would use light gray becuase its more on th e cooler side for tempature and it wont over heat it when the suns if we would to be laying in his dog house
27618,10,1,white it will keep the inside of the doghouse from getting to warm during the summer
27619,10,0,light gray it might fit because black wouldnt go eit the dog if the dog is a light color then a light gray if the dog is a drak c olor then drak gray would match him but the draker color the more they di e it would be better if the doghouse was light gray because the lighter c olors dont make you sweat more
27620,10,0,black the dog house will not affect the dog house t he black paint for the doghouse will keep it cool
27621,10,2,white white would be a good color beacause it would make the dog house be fresh inside not so hot acording to the data tabl e white got the lowest average air tempature for how hot it gets bu t black got the most highest
27622,10,2,white brandi and jerry should paint the dog house w hite because the jar with the white lid had the lowest temperature inside the jar and its average was 42 deg c this way the inside of the dog house will stay cool and not get to hot
27623,10,1,white i think that if they were building a dog hous e they should use a white paint color because then the doghouse will be cool instead of hot because the paint is lighter
27624,10,2,white the wite paint will keep the dog house cooler because in the experiment the white paint had the lowest tempurature a fter ten minuutes being 11 degrees cooler than the black paint with a t emp of 54 degrees
27625,10,1,dark gray dark gray was the most consistant energy absorber with an average of 48 deg c the dog house will not be too cold or hot and is capeable of maintaing an consistent temperature all year long
27626,10,1,white i choose the color white because if it is a s unny day outside and the dog wants some shade he will go in the dog house because the white does not attracted energy as much as black the dog ho use will be nice and cool for the dog
27627,10,1,white it would stay cooler than a darker one would because it doesn't absorb energy like a darker one would
27628,10,1,light gray using the light gray paint would be good beca use its still dark to the point where it will collect energy but not a wh ole lot to the point where the dog is dieing from the heat but not light enough to the point where the dog isn't getting any energy from the sun
27629,10,2,white the color of the dog house could affect the t emperature makeing the dog house cooler this is true because in the expe riment the white colored jar was the coldest with and average of 42 deg c
27630,10,1,light gray the color light gray will make the doghouse cool in the summer and still keep it a little warm in the summer
27631,10,2,white white will make it cooler in there so when its sunny out the dog can go in there and won't burn up after 10 minutes the white lid averaged 42 degrees so that means its cooler then the black lid which after 10 minutes averaged 53 degrees
27632,10,0,black the color might affect the outside of the dog house because in the summer it might get lighter and the winter it might get darker
27633,10,2,white white would be the best color because white will keep the inside of the dog house at the coolest temperature in the experement the black lid caused the inside of the jar to be at an a verage of 53 deg c and the white lid caused it to be an average of 42 deg c if the outside was black the dog house would be too hot and if it is white the house will be cool enough for the dog to live in
27634,10,2,white the inside of the dog house after being painted white might make the doghouse be colder in the data it says trial 1 and next to white it says 42 deg c in trial 3 it had 41 deg c the average temperature of white was 42 deg c the lowest average out of every color
27635,10,2,white the best paint color for the doghouse is whit e because the temperature is not too hot when put under light black woul d not be a suitable color for the doghouse because its average temperatur e under a lamp for ten minutes is 53 deg c which is too hot white pai nt however has an average of 42 deg c when put under a lamp for ten minu tes this means that with a white doghouse the dog wouldn't over heat
27636,10,1,dark gray the color gray would absorb only some of the lights enery for heat not as much as black and since dogs have thick coa ts you dont want it to be too hot inside the doghouse also it gets cold in the winter and brandi and jerry's dog their building a house for might not have a really thick fur and it would be neccesary to be at 0least so mewhat warm in the doghouse thats why gray would be the best color
27637,10,2,white because in the summer the white color will d eflect the sun's heat keeping the doghouse 10 deg cooler than if you w ould paint it black because in the experiment the air temperature insid e of the jar with the white lid stayed in the low 40's while the jar wit h the black lid stayed in the low mid 50's proving the white deflects he at while black asorbs it
27638,10,1,white the doghouse will stay cooler on the inside
27639,10,1,white the color white would effect the doghouse's i nside in a way were it would absorb less heat therore it would be cooler in the inside of the dog house
27640,10,1,black the darker color will keep most of the heat i n the dog house than the color white would the increase of the heat is b ecause of the darker color in the dog house
27641,10,1,white the paint color that i choose is white i chos se this color because it will not make the inside of the dog house as hot the color might affect the inside of the dog house because white does n ot absorb as much heat as a darker color would in the summer in stead of it getting up to 53 deg c with black paint it will be a cooler 42 deg c with the white paint
27642,10,2,black the black paint will keep the dog warm inside the doghouse during winter just like how the black jare lid heated the air in the jar 11 deg c higher than the jarwith a white lid
27643,10,2,light gray the doghouse wouldnt be too cold or too hot i got this data from the table they made of all the adverages
27644,10,2,light gray the light gray is a good color to choose beca use it won't be too hot in the summer and won't be too cold in the winter the light gray was the 2nd coldest jar
27645,10,2,white the color will keep the dog cooler and will n ot get the dog really hot in the expirement it says that it got down to 4 1 deg c and the lowest for others was 44 deg c
27646,10,1,white the temperatur would be lower because in the experiment the white lid had a temperature 11 deg below that of the bl ack lid
27647,10,1,white i think white becaause white reflects the sun so its not as hot inside the dog house
27648,10,0,white to keep the dog house cooler a black dog hous e
27649,10,1,white because black attracts more heat than white
27650,10,0,dark gray because the results of their experiment showe d that a dark color attracts more sunlight it would be best to have a da rk gray paint although dark colors would be a very bad idea for hot sun ny days because it would become extremely hot inside of the doghouse and the dog would begin to dehydrate and would have to have it's waterdish re filled two times a day but with a light gray paint on the doghouse the dog would be able to stay cool during summertime
27651,10,2,white the color white is the best choice because it will keep the doghouse colder a white jar kept the jar cooler by 11 deg rees
27652,10,2,white this color will affect the dog by keeping the dog cool in the summer becaus the darker the lid color the greater the i ncrease in air tempeture
27653,10,1,light gray this color would effect the dog house by keep ing the air warm and cold so it would be the right temerature
27654,10,1,white i would make it much cooler for the dog in hi s new dog house
27655,10,1,white th white paint will keep the dog house cool w hen it gets hot outside
27656,10,2,white the color white might affect the inside of th e dog house to be cooler the average of the three trials for white was l ower than the average of the other colors white was 3 deg c cooler than light gray and as much as 11 deg c cooler than the black
27657,10,0,white because white draws the least amount of energ y
27658,10,1,dark gray the best color to paint the doghouse would be dark gray because dog houses are usually meant to keep dogs warm dark gray would absorb enough sunlight to make the inside warm but not hot therefore the dog would be most comfortable with the color dark gray
27659,10,2,white if the doghouse was painted white the inside of the doghouse wouldn't get to hot for the dog this is because i n the data table the average temerature for the light gray lid color was 42 deg c also if the doghouse was painted black or any of the other c olors the dog would possibly get to hot because they are darker colors t hat absorbs more energy
27660,10,1,dark gray it will warm the doghouse and help the dogho use contain a consistant tempeture at 54 deg c
27661,10,1,white white will keep the dog house cooler because in the expirament white had the lowest average temperature when it was pu t under the light for 10 minutes
27662,10,2,white i think the best paint color for the doghouse is white i believe that since white is the lighest color of paint they have it will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler the lighter the col or the less heat it will asorb in the data the average temperature of the air inside the glass jar when the lid was white was 42 deg c for bl ack the darkest color lid they had the average temperature of the air w as 53 deg c that's a total difference of 11 deg c
27663,10,1,black the color black would keep the dog house warm er
27664,10,1,black black is a good color to use because it absorbs heat it would make the inside of the dog house warm much like the hot lamp experiment in the lab the lamp became hot because the black lid absorbed heat from the lamp i think the black paint will absorb heat from the sun and make the dog house warm inside
27665,10,1,white this color would be best because it would not get as hot as a darker color such as black making it better suited for the dog
27666,10,1,black it will make the dog house warmer
27667,10,1,light gray they should paint it light gray because tha t color attracts heat but not so much that it would get so hot in there i n the summer and not too cold in the winter
27668,10,1,dark gray this color might affect the doghouse by absor bing energy from the sun but you dont want black because you dont want it to hot for the dog
27669,10,0,light gray it might make it look not as good but it will also be cooler because black lets the heat in not out it will also be lighter inside at night
27670,10,2,black i would choose black for the paint color beca use the black paint would absorb the heat energy from the sun and heat up the inside of the doghouse the black lid had an average tempurature of 53 deg c which was the highest average tempurature out of all the lids and the white had a tempurature of 42 deg c which was the lowest they had a difference of 11 deg c meaning that the black paint would keep t he doghouse warmer
27671,10,1,white i say white because is attracs less hot
27672,10,1,white the color white might affect the doghouse because inside the doghouse the temperature will be lower than if using the paint color to be black
27673,10,1,white white does not absorb as much energy as the o ther colors so the doghouse would be colder inside
27674,10,1,black i chosed black because it will keep the house warm because on the table it clearly states that black absorbs more ener gy
27675,10,0,light gray when the dog house gets dirty it wont show th e parts that are dirty because its the color black
27676,10,2,light gray the light gray paint color would be the best because of the fact that if the dog was in the dog house it would not be too hot nor too cold the data shows that the average tempreaure of the p ain is as follows black 53 deg c dark grey 48 deg c light grey 45 deg c white 42 deg c so you see that with the ligth grey it still will absorbe some light so it wont be to hot or to cold in there the light grey is a perfect inbewteen temprature for the dog house because to much heat for an animal is not good and so it to little heat
27677,10,0,dark gray dark gray was the only color that didn't eith er decrease or increase in temperature during the hot lamp experiment if the built a dog house dark gray the inside of the dog house wouldn't ove r heat
27678,10,1,white they should use white as a color because it w ill not be as hot in the dog house than with a black dog house darker col ors asborb energy and lighter color dont so white would be a good choice
27679,10,1,white the color white would affect the doghouse bet ter because the doghouse will stay cooler
27680,10,2,white it will keep it the coolest out of all the co lors the temp for white was 41 to 43 while the other colrs were rangeing to 44 to 54 deg
27681,10,1,light gray i think that light gray would be best because it attrack some heat so during the winter it will be warm then later d uring the summer it will take in some heat but it won't take in enough to heat the dog up alot so he will stay at a pretty well kept temperature
27682,10,1,white it will keep it cooler
27683,10,2,white white would be the best color for the doghous e because white absorbs less energy which would make the doghouse cooler for the dog according to the experiment the white colored lid had an ave rage air temperature of 42 deg c while the black lid had an average air temperature of 53 deg c
27684,10,2,white brandi and jerry should paint thier doghouse white because the inside of the doghouse will stay cool even during the s ummer the data shows that the white lids average heat temperture was abo ut 42 c and the black was about 53 c white was 11 degrees cooler
27685,10,2,black with black paint the dog would have a warmer dog hose because black absorbs heat in the experiment the temperature fo r the black lid was always the highest
27686,10,2,black that color would provide the warmest environm ent for the dog in the doghouse because the black paint would create the warmest air temperature in the experiment the jar with the black lid r eached an average of 53 deg which was 5 deg more than the next highe st temperature 48 deg
27687,10,1,black it would effect in the heat because it would be warmer
27688,10,1,white the white house wouldbe better becauseit refl ects light way better than black because it absorbs the light causing it to get hotter
27689,10,1,white white would keep it cooler in the doghouse lo nger
27690,10,1,white it will let the dog cool down on a hot day faster
27691,10,2,white the average temperature from the glass jar experiment for the color white was 42 degrees this is the lowest temperature out of the four colors black dark gray light gray and whit e using the color white would reflect the suns heat causing the doghouse to be cool and not overheat therefore creating a safe doghouse habitat
27692,10,0,black fdddfddf
27693,10,2,white the color will effect the dog house by keeping it cooler than the other colors because in the expiriment the white lid always had the lowest temperature
27694,10,1,dark gray i believe that the dark gray would be a good paint color for the dog house because depending on where they live that dog house woudn't be too hot nor cold
27695,10,1,light gray the color will effect by having black and whi te mix because black brings heat and white is cooling color and mix them the dog house would be warm
27696,10,0,black after a while the doghouse color might fade o ut
27697,10,1,dark gray the color i chose till make the dog house war m but not to hot and dark gray stayed the same temperature at 48 for all 4 trials
27698,10,0,dark gray when the heat stays the same outside it will stay the same inside too
27699,10,1,black using black paint color on the dog house will increase the temperature inside the dog by a few degrees making it more comfortable for the dog
27700,10,1,light gray the light gray might affect the doghouse but not too much because the light gray is almost at about room temperature if you put black in there it will be too hot if you put white in there it might be too cold
27701,10,2,white by making the doghouse white the air inside the doghouse would be cooler than with any other color in the experiment lid color vs air temperature inside glass jar the jar with the white lid was only an average of 42 deg c after 10 minutes of heating the jar with the black lid however was an average of 53 deg c after 10 minut es of heating the jar with the white lid was an average of 11 deg c cooler than the jar with the black lid therefor the color white will make the doghouse cooler inside and is the best color for the doghouse
27702,10,1,black it will make it hot in the dog hopuse
27703,10,2,white the color white would make the dog house absorb less heat and make it cooler acording to the experiment black got 53 deg c and white got 42 deg c so it should do the same with the dog house
27704,10,1,black i think balck so it willl keep it insolated a nd warm for the dog
27705,10,2,white i would choose black because in the lid color vs air temperature inside glass jar table it showed that wh ite was colder than black and the rest of the darker colors for example the average for white was 42 deg c and the average for black was 5 3 deg c
27706,10,1,white i would pick a white dog house because the white jar lid had the least amout of tempature increase it only had about a an 18 deg c increese while the black jar lid had a 29 deg c increase
27707,10,1,white white will reflect the heat so the dog house will be cool
27708,10,1,white the white panit because if you panit it a dak er color the results would be a hoter dog house and the resluts for a whi te dog house would be a cooler house
27709,10,1,black how it can affect is that when is reallly hot outside the dogshouse can get really warm or like hot cause the sun is absorbing more energy
27710,10,2,dark gray i think that brandi and jerry should use the color dark gray because if its summer and its really hot then it wont be to hot for the dog and wen its winter the dog can still be worm inough be cause the air inside in a jar like it shows in lid color vs air temperat ure inside a glass jar the medium colors that are not to hot or to warm i s dark gray and light gray so eather of them is fine because u wouldnt wa nt the dog to freez to death and u wouldnt want it to hot
27711,10,2,white it will keep the doghouse cool and not hot w hen brandi and jerry put the white lid on the average temperature inside the jar was 42 deg c when they put the black jar on the average temp erature was 53 deg c
27712,10,1,black black because the color black atracs the heat and it gets realy hot
27713,10,1,white if the doghouse was white the temperature in the doghouse would be so much cooler than if the doghouse was black white would be best for the doghouse because you would not want it to be too warm white would fit the best
27714,10,0,white white color will deflec more sunlight
27715,10,1,white white will not affect the doghouse because in the results in the experiment it shows that white was the lowest temper ature than all the temperatures of different lid colors
27716,10,1,black it will be warmer for the dog
27717,10,2,white white would be the best choise because it att racts less heat as shown in the experiment the jar with the white lid onl y got up to 43 deg c at the highest and the black lid got up to 54 deg c at the highest and the dark grey and light grey were inbetween
27718,10,2,white painting the doghouse white would make it cooler inside the doghouse i know this because the average temperature for the white lidded jar was 42 deg c and the average temperatures for the other colored jars were all equal to or above 45 deg c
27719,10,0,white because it has the least amount of air pressu re
27720,10,2,black painting your dog house this color will affec t the inside by making it hotter is what i get from the chart and the res ults the kids who did this project 0
27721,10,1,light gray light gray doesn't asorb as much heat as blac k or dark gray which would help keep the doghouse cool in the summer tim e it also asorbs some heat at least more than white which would help k eep the doghouse from getting too cold in the winter this makes it the o ptimal paint to use when designing a doghouse
27722,10,1,white it will keep the doghouse cool
27723,10,2,light gray if they use light grey then the doghouse will stay cooler because if the color of the paint is dark then it will absor b more heat as it did in the lamp experiment
27724,10,0,white i think white because in the summer time the dog house is not to hot for the dog house and warm air can come inside the dog house door to make the inside a little wwarmer
27725,10,1,white the color white would reflect the light on th e house instead of absorbing it like the black would keeping the house cool inside
27726,10,0,white the white one will reflect more heat than the other colors
27727,10,2,black i would chose a black for the doghouse beacus e the air temperature would be hotter therefore keeping the dog warmer i n the winter time i know this because in brandi and jerry's experiment when the lid was black the average air temperature was 53 deg celsius and when the lid was white the average air temperature was 42 deg celcius
27728,10,1,black they should use black paint for their doghous e in the experiment the iar inside the jar was 5 deg c warmer than the second warmest color the jar with the black lid was 53 deg c
27729,10,2,white it would keep the doghouse cool in the summer after ten minutes the jar with the white lid was on average only 42 deg c the jar with the black lid however had an aver age of 53 deg c after ten m inutes this would be much too hot for the dog
27730,10,1,black using black paint it will increase the tempat ure in the house so that their dog will stay warm
27731,10,1,white the color white does not absorbed energy from the sun the color will make the dog house cooler instead of if you make the top black it will be as hot as an oven inside the dog house
27732,10,0,dark gray my color is dark gray it might effect the inside because its gonna make it look scary in there
27733,10,2,black it would increase the temperature of the dogh ouse especially when close to light because darker colors make more hea t for ecample when brandi and jerry were doing the experiment on the lid colo rs black had the highest amount of heat this is mostly because its an energy transfer when light hits darker colors it turns in to th ermal and or heat energy
27734,10,2,light gray light gray could effect the tempature of the doghouse because draker colors absorb more heat than light colors do if brandi and jerry were to paint the dog house black the house would absor b too much heat since in the data the average was 53 deg c if you cho se dark gray the average tempatrure was 48 deg c which could still be too warm if you chose light gray its average was 45 deg c which is r ight in the middle of being warm and cold and if you were to use white t he average was 42 deg c which could be too cold in the winter time th erefore using the light gray could help keep the doghouse warm and cool and the same time
27735,10,0,light gray in the winter the dog might get cold so you m ake it a sort of light color so it can stay warmer in the summer it will be hot and the dog will want to be cooler so you pick a sort of light co lor
27736,10,0,dark gray drak gray will not over heat the dog or chang e its temperature
27737,10,2,light gray light gray would atract more energy than whit e which would keep it warmer but it would also stay cooler than black or dark gray
27738,10,1,light gray i think that the best color for a dog house w ould probably be light grey that way inside the dog house wouldn't be to o hot or too cold if the dog house was white inside the dog house would probably be too cold since white doesn't absorb as much energy i wouldn 't paint the dog house black though because it might get too hot same wi th dark grey so light grey would be the best color for a dog house
27739,10,1,white since the color white's average was 42 deg c the coolest temperature it would be the best choice since white doesn't get as much heat the dog in the doghouse would be cooler than in a darker colored doghouse
27740,10,1,white choose white because it won't absorb much heat like black does 54 deg will make the dog house too hot white is g ood because its a nice 41 deg
27741,10,1,white becuase white gathers less energy which will make it cooler inside than any of the other colors
27742,10,2,black using black paint to paint a doghouse would a bsorb more heat as the data from the experiment shows in the experiment the jar with the black lid heated up to 53 deg on average while whit e only heated up to 42 deg on average
27743,10,2,white white is the best choice of color because the average temputre was 42 so comparing that to the black which is 53 the d og house would be cooler with white pant
27744,10,1,white on the graph white is the one that had the c oolest tempature because the light went right through the color so it d idn't get really hot as shown on the graph
27745,10,1,white using a white color on the dog house will dec rese the amound of heat coming into the dog hous ther for it will k eep the dog house more cooler then those darker color's this is becouse w hite absorbs no color but its self
27746,10,2,black if you choose black then inside the dog house will be very hot because in the experiment the darker the color the mo re hot it got inside the jar because dark colors absorb energy
27747,10,1,black cuz will keep dog warm
27748,10,0,white it is to lite so it wouldent let of as much l ite
27749,10,1,black black atracts heat
27750,10,1,white keep it cool
27751,10,2,white white is the best choice since the highest te mperaure was in the black jar at 54 deg and the lowest was in the whit e jar at 43 deg showing an 11 deg difference keeping the dog less ho t in his house
27752,10,0,dark gray because it can capture some sunlight
27753,10,2,white i think that the doghouse should be painted white because the lighter colors reflect more light energy than the dark the average temperature of black lided jars was 53 deg the average of the white jars was 42 deg the dogs should live in a house that wont absorb too much energy so they wont overheat
27754,10,1,white it wont be so hot
27755,10,2,white they should paint the doghouse white because in the data it showed that white was always the coldest in every trial an d if they did black the dog would always be hot
27756,10,1,light gray inside the doghouse in the summer it will kee p it somewat cool and in the winter it will keep it somewat warm also it was in my opinion the central temperature of them all being 45 deg c
27757,10,1,white if they made a white doghouse the air tempatu re would not be as hot is if they made the dog house black because lighte r colors absorb less light
27758,10,1,dark gray it would keep it warm in the wonter and cold in the summer so the dog wouldn't be to hot or to cold
27759,10,1,light gray this color would keep the dog house cool in t he summer and in the winter would still help heat the house the house wou ld be warmer if thw color was black
27760,10,0,black the color might affect the inside tempature of the doghouse because the darkness provdes a type of covering that is like a insulation
27761,10,1,white white would absorb less energy in the doghous e making it cooler inside the doghouse
27762,10,1,light gray it will make it so it's nice and warm at nigh t but still has enough heat retaned at night to keep him her warm
27763,10,0,black if the coloris darker it will absorb energy
27764,10,2,black if you were to chose black as your paint colo r it woul warmer than the dark gray light gray and white in this expe riment black got about 53 deg c and the white got 42 deg c
27765,10,1,light gray well if u have a darker color like black for an exampl it could be way too hot in the mid day but if u have a light color like white for an example it would probably be way to cold at night so a light gray color would be the just right tempature
27766,10,1,white painting the doghouse white would allow the d oghouse to stay cooler in the summer so that the dogs do not get too hot inside
27767,10,0,light gray i chose light gray because dog's eyesight onl y contains black and white sight they dont see color like humans do so a light gray dog house will catch dogs attention
27768,10,1,light gray this color will make the doghouse stay cooler when it is warm and sunny but it will also create heat when it is cold
27769,10,1,light gray this color can effect the doghouse by keeping it cool but to to cold and not to hot becuase dark gray or black will o ver heat the dog because of there fur
27770,10,1,dark gray because it wasint the hotest or coldest tempi ture so it wouldent be to hot or cold in the dog house it had steady resu lts
27771,10,2,white the white color would let the inside of the doghouse be cooler than the other types of paint because the white lid's average temp was 42 deg c and the black lid's average temp was 53 deg c that is an 11 deg differance for the dog to feel
27772,10,0,white because if you have a dark color the light wi ll make it hot for he dog
27773,10,2,white the white paint color will reflect off heat a nd not absorb as much energy as the black paint which is a good paint col or for the summer the white paint color average for the temperature is 4 2 deg c while the black paint color average for the temperatue is 53 deg c
27774,10,0,black might affect the doghouse look nice for the d og
27775,10,1,white it wouldn't heat up so fast
27776,10,2,black i chose the color black for the doghouse beca use from the data collected black was warmer than any other color with a n average temperature of 53 deg c compared to the lowest temperature of 42 deg c for the color white the dog in the house will stay warmer beca use black is the warmest color which i know by looking at the data brandi and jerry collected
27777,10,1,dark gray i think that dark gray could be the color bec ause it woulld not be to cold or to hot so in the summer the dog house c ould stay cool and in the winter it could stay warm
27778,10,2,light gray i chose light gray because it will keep the i nside of the doghouse from being 2 warm if they live in an extremel y hot place the average temperature of the jar in the light gray jar was 45 deg c so it is enough to keep the dog warm but not enough to make it uncomfortable
27779,10,2,white white reflects energy instead of absorbing it like other colors it also had the lowest air temperature inside in the jar of all three lids this would make the doghouse cooler inside and more comfortable for the dogs inside
27780,10,1,white white because after 10 minutes of heat it get s to about 42 deg c and dogs should have cooling temperature not hot
27781,10,1,dark gray because it will keep the dog house warm
27782,10,1,light gray the dog house can eather be hot or cold so th ere isn't much of a difference in the heat amount in the dog house
27783,10,2,light gray the light gray color i think would be the bes t color to paint the dog house because the light gray color would absorb some heat enery to keep the dog warm but would also keep the dog cooler t han black or dark gray and warmer than the white from the experiment the light gray lid had an average temperature of 45 deg c while the blac k lid had an average temperature of 53 deg c and the dark gray lid had a n average temperature of 48 deg c the white lid had an average temperat ure of 42 deg c the white color would keep the dog cool but the white c olor would reflect most of the heat energy which would in turn no make th e doghouse warm when needed
27784,10,1,light gray the light grey soaks up heat but not too much
27785,10,1,white this color might affect the dog house by not getting that much air inside white has the lowest average tempeture whic h is 42 deg c
27786,10,2,white i chose white because it would make it for a cooler house for the dog acording to the data table shown it says that the white lid will produce less heat than the other colors
27787,10,2,white i belive white will work the best because it doesnt conduct as much heat as the orther one s did for exsample b lack drak grey light gray all got imbetween 44 and 54 well while the whi te paint only got 42 41 and 42 as an aveage
27788,10,2,black if brandi and jerry pick the black roof then the inside of the doghouse is going to be hotter than if they were to pic k the dark grey light grey or white roof in the expirement when brandi and jerry used the black lid the temperature got up to 54 deg c and wi th the dark grey lid it only got up to 48 deg c with the light grey l id the tempertature got up to 46 deg c and with the white lid the tem perature only got up to 43 deg c so most likely the black roof would ma ke the inside of the dog house hot
27789,10,2,black a black roof will keep the doghouse warm the average temperature of the black lid was 53 deg c but the average for t he next highest color was 48 deg c therefore a black roof will keep th e dog at least 5 deg c warmer than any other color
27790,10,1,dark gray dark grey would keep it to a cool temperature but not too cold and not too warm which is good for a dog
27791,10,2,white i chose white becuase it's the coolest and dogs have a lot of fur so then they can escape the sun in a shady cool dog house there was quite a big difference between black which got up to 54 degrees c and white whos highest was 43 in the winter they will have a big fur coat so they won't need it warm inside their dog house plus there isn't as much sun if its too cold they can go inside the house
27792,10,0,black because it increases the engery
27793,10,0,white this color might affect the doghouse by makin g it more ditry and reflecting off of the walls and see light coming from every where
27794,10,0,white so you can see the dog in its house
27795,10,2,light gray i think light gray would be the best paint co lor because it's not going to make the dog house that hot but you also do n't want it to be to cold so it's a comfortable temperature light g ray averaged about 45 deg c while white averaged 42 deg c dark gray a t 48 deg c and black at 53 deg c
27796,10,2,light gray it will keep the dog warm but not as hot as u sing black or dark grey paint the average temp for black is 53 deg and the average for the light grey paint is 45 deg an 8 deg difference
27797,10,1,white they dog house would be cooler and not has ho t as a black or darker color dog house would be making it better to be in on a hot day
27798,10,1,black black is the best color to choose because in the experiment it said that the black lid attracted the most heat so the y should use black paint to trap heat in the doghouse for the dog
27799,10,1,black it would make the doghouse's temperature rise
27800,10,2,white white paint would effect the dog house becaus e the lighter the colour the less heat is absorbed according to the data the difference in temperature would be around 11 degreees centigrade th en the black colour so the white colour would absorb less heat resulting in a less hot doghouse
27801,10,2,dark gray dark gray is the best choice because its not to hot and its not to cold the average tempture is 48 deg c and the oth er are 53 45 and 42
27802,10,1,black black would ceep the house warm wene the uv r ays hit it they colect all the energy wich is in other words heat
27803,10,1,white white would work good cause that way the dogh ouse wont get to hot and it would be more comfortable
27804,10,2,white the best color to paint a dog house would be white becuase white reflects heat from the sun which causes the dog house to become cooler in temperature my support to my statement is in trial 1 the white white lid jar was the least in temperature becuase the white lidded jar was 42 deg c and the light gray lidded jar was 44 deg c and the dark gray lidded jar was 48 deg c and the black lidded jar was 54 deg c also in all the other trials the wjite lidded jar was cooler i n temperature then the diffrent color lidded jars so brandi and jerry sh ould pick white to color there dog house if they want the dog house to be cooler in temperature so there dog wouldn't get too hot and die
27805,10,2,white the white color will be much cooler then the other colors because in the experiment the darker colors made the inside of the jar hotter but the white color hade the lowest temperture which would be the ideal color for a dog house
27806,10,1,dark gray the best paint color for the doghouse would b e dark gray this color may affect the inside of the doghouse because it would either keep it warmer or cooler depending on the weather the resu lts from the experiment say that the dark gray lid made the jar 48 deg c in ten minutes so it would keep the doghouse warm it really just dep ends on the climate of where the dog live
27807,10,1,light gray i picked light gray because i think the black and dark gray doghouse would absorb too much energy and make it too hot for a dog to be in whereas the light gray doghouse won't be too hot or t oo cold
27808,10,1,white white would be the best color because when it is summer and it gets hot the inside will be cool because black absorbs sun while white reflexs sun
27809,10,0,dark gray if there is dirt in the dog house it would be hard to see it
27810,10,2,white by choosing a white color for the dog house i t will keep the dog cooler i know this because in the experiment t he average temperature in the jar with a black lid was 53 but the averag e temperature in the jar with a white lid was 42 therefore the darker th e paint color the warmer the dog house
27811,10,2,white the best color for the doghouse would be whit e because it absorbs less energy than a black color and the black lid a verage was 53 deg c and the white lid was 42 deg c
27812,10,1,white the color white will effect the dog house bec ause the white paint will reflect more white then black paint would so t he white doghouse will be cooler in temerature
27813,10,1,white it would be much cooler than if it was black
27814,10,0,white white color doesn't absorb as much light as b lack black color get hotter by direct sunlight because it is abosorbing it while white color simply reflects the light so it stays at about the s ame temperature
27815,10,1,light gray the light gray color might prevent it from be ing either too cold or to hot also in the results the color gray was the s econd to least heated of them all
27816,10,1,white it will make the dog house cooler than if you used black paint because white paint doesnt absorb that much energy
27817,10,2,white the dog house will be cooler if painted white and more comfortable for a dog in the experiment the temperatures for the jars in deg c with the black lid were 53 dark gey 48 light grey 45 and white 42 the white was 11 deg c less than the hottest jar black
27818,10,1,white white because it doesnt absorb as much heat a s black
27819,10,2,light gray the color of the paint on the doghouse will a ffect it in many ways to begin with it will change the temperature of t he doghouse if the doghouse were black then it would absorb alot of the energy radiating from the sun because darker colors hold heat more the white would reflect alot of the heat of of the doghouse making the temp erature cooler then if it were painted darker the dark grey is going to keep it warm but not as hot as the black paint would and the light grey would keep it cooler but not as cool as the white would so it would al l depend on were you lived and what temperature best suited your pet th e darker colors are going to absorb more of the heat and the lighter col ors are going to reflect more of it off i would choose light grey for my doghouse though because it would keep more of the heat off but it would also keep it warmer then just having it be white
27820,10,2,dark gray if i were to paint a dog house the color i wo uld choose would be dark grey because black would absorb to much heat dur ing the hot days and white would absorb no heat so during cold night the dog house would be very cold and dark grey is just in the middle so it do es not get to hot or to cold
27821,10,0,dark gray dark gray is the best color to paint a doghou se with for many reasons one reason is that in the results of their expe riment drak gray had the same temperature all 3 trial times and same aver age of 48 deg c this ment that dark gray is a good color for a doghouse because it will absorb the right amount of energy in order for the doghou se to maintain at the right temperature dark grayis not a too dark color but not a too light color either
27822,10,2,black the color black will make the doghouse warmer this is becuase in the experiment the average temperature for the black lid was 53 deg c compared to the white lid at the average of 42 deg c this shows that the darker the color the warmer the object doghouse wi ll be because it obsorbs more heat
27823,10,1,light gray i chose light gray because it is the perfect temperature it's average temperature 45 deg c is a very good tempera ture not too hot and not too cold if you paint the doghouse taht clour it will be warm but only slightly it would protect the dog from swelte ring heat but keep it from freezing
27824,10,2,light gray if the doghouse were to be light gray the air temperature wouldn't be too low but not too high the average temperature of light gray compared to the average of black is 8 deg while the difference between light gray and white is 3 deg this way light gray would be perfect as an in between
27825,10,0,white the dog well be more comfitable in the dog ho use
27826,10,2,light gray i chose light gray because it doesn't attract a whole lot of heat like if you were to us black but attracts more heat then white does inside the doghouse in the winter would be nice because it would attract some heat to be warm in the winter in the summer it wou ld be warmer then winter because there would be more sun and attract heat but not as much as if the color of the doghouse was black another reaso n why i chose light was it had an average temp of 45 deg c warmer than w hites average temp of 42 deg c
27827,10,2,white i think that white would be the best color be cause in the data they had the lowest temputure so it would be the coldes t for the dog
27828,10,1,white white is the best color to choose because it reflects the sun's rays better than any other color and it wont make the inside get to hot
27829,10,1,white white will not attract the light as much as a ny of the othe colors therefore allowing the dog to stay cool
27830,10,0,light gray coloring the doghouse light gray could keep t he temperature inside the doghouse at a cool average of 45 deg c which is the average temperature inside the glass jar for the lid color vs air temperature inside glass jar experiment
27831,10,2,white the best color would be white because the ins ide of the doghouse would be cooler because the color white atracts less heat energy then the other colors because the results show that white had lower temperatures than the other colors
27832,10,0,dark gray brandi and jerry should use dark gray because it would be a comfertable temperature for the dog at 48 deg c wich the data says is it's average
27833,10,1,light gray it wold keep it warmer in the winter and cool er in the summer the medium shade color is a fantastic way to keep a pet warm
27834,10,1,white because it will stay the coolest and the dog wont like it in there if its cold
27835,10,1,white so the dog house doesent heat up as fast in t he summer so the dog can stay in his house longer
27836,10,2,light gray the color would affect the doghouse because d arker colors absorb more light energy so light grey would absorb some bu t not alot keeping the inside of the doghouse cool and not really hot 45 deg
27837,10,0,light gray it will be the right temp for a dog
27838,10,2,dark gray i would choose dark gray because it will not absorb as much light as black would but it still is a dark color to abso rb some light this would affect the inside temperature of the doghouse b ecause it won't be to cold nor to hot in the doghouse comparing my choic e to the expirement when they used black as the lid color it gave the hot est inside air temperature dark gray was in 2cnd place with a temperatur e of 48 deg c but i thought 45 deg c for the light gray would be to c old
27839,10,2,white painting the doghouse white would affect it b ecause in the summer the doghouse would be cooler in the experiment th e white lid had the lowest temperature of 42 deg c while the pthers were much higher
27840,10,2,white i chose to paint the doghouse the color white based off of brandi and jerry's experiment results in the experiment w hen they tested the lid color black the average temperature inside the j ar was 53 deg c this was the highest temperature out of the colors and the temperature raised by 29 deg meanwhile the white lid had an avera ge temperature of 42 deg c therefore having the lowest temperature aver age this time the temperature raised only 18 deg after ten minutes c ompared to the black lid the white lid raised to a temperature and had a change from the original temperature of 11 deg less ultimately i cho se to paint the doghouse white to keep the temperature the coolest white had the lowest average temperature of 42 deg c and would keep any dog n ice and cool
27841,10,1,dark gray i say dark gray because it keeps the doghouse warm enough so that if it's cold outside and it doesn't get it too hot for a sunny day outside it's a 50 50 type thing warm enough and not too cold
27842,10,2,white black average temperature was 53 deg dark gray average temperature was 48 deg light gray average temperature was 45 deg white average temperature was 42 deg because of the cool temperatures i would ch oose white as the doghouse color with black the doghouse would be prett y hot and uncomfortable for the dog
27843,10,2,white white would be the best color to have for a d og house because it's temperature would keep the dog house the coolest i n the experiment the white colored jar had an average of 42 deg c so th at was the best choice and the worst choice was black the black colored jar had an average of 53 deg c so that was the worst choice becau se it could be to hot for the dog
27844,10,1,white it will keep it from being to hot in the summ er
27845,10,1,light gray it may affect the dog house because if its to o hot then the dog will get too hot and if its too cold the dog would fre eze so if its not too hot and not too cold the dog house will be good for the dog year around
27846,10,0,dark gray this color will make the doghouse one tempera ture and not many different temperatures in the experiment the dark gray lid stayed at 48 deg c
27847,10,1,black if you would paint a doghouse you would want your dog to be warm so painting the doghouse black would keep him or her warm
27848,10,2,white the color might affect the doghouse because t he darker the color is the hotter it is inside and the lighter the color the cooler it is inside for example when tested the blakc got 53 deg c the dark gray got 48 deg c the light gray got 45 deg c and the white got 42 deg c you see as the color increases from darkto light the temp ature decreases
27849,10,2,white i would choose the color white for the color of the doghouse because it will make the inside of the dog house cooler for the dog so that during hot summer days the dog can stay cool and not super hot the reason why this would work is shown on the trial board wh ile there was a black lid on a jar the average temperature of inside of j ar after 10 minutes was 53 deg c when there was a white lid on the jar the average temperature of the jar was 42 deg c that is a 11 deg difference between the two lids so if you want the doghouse to be colde r for the dog you'd want to get a white doghouse
27850,10,2,black black because if black had the most heating average maybe it might have the most heating average for ther dog house
27851,10,1,white it cant be black because black obsorbs light which would increase the temp and white reflects light so that is why w hite kept the doghouse cooler at an average
27852,10,2,black if they were to use a black paint it would de finetely increase the dog houses air tempature accordinq to the data the color black had an average of 52 deg c after ten minutes of the experi ment unlike the other lighter colors which had lower average tempatures
27853,10,2,white the data table shows that the white lid jar t ook in the least heat the black lid jar took in an average of 53 deg c after 10 minutes under the lamp the white lid jar only took in an averag e of 42 deg c this is why the doghouse should be painted white to keep most of the heat out
27854,10,2,dark gray if the doghouse were dark gray it might affe ct the inside temperature of the doghouse heat is attracted to darker ob jects so it would be warmer but not as warm as it would be black the d ata from the experiment shows that the black lid on average was 53 deg c the dark gray lid was 48 deg c the light gray was 45 deg c and the white was 42 deg c
27855,10,0,black the color black could affect the temperature in the dog house because the color black can attract light and heat since the color black is an absence of light
27856,10,2,white brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white because then the inside of the doghouse would stay cool and comfortable for the dog to be inside it when it's sunny outside i know this because in the investigation when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a black lid the air temperature inside the jar was an average of 53 deg c after 10 minutes but when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a white lid the air temperature inside the jar was an average of 42 deg c after 10 minutes so if the doghouse was painted white the temperature would be cooler
27857,10,0,light gray it will affect the doghouse by it being coole r then heat temperature getting attracted to it
27858,10,2,white white would keep the doghouse cooler in the s ummer because it reflects more light waves than it absorbs in their test brandi and jerry found that white kept the jar the coolest
27859,10,2,white the white color paint will protect the doghou se from heat because it isn't as dark from the experiment it shows that a darker object stores more energy causing it to heat up in air temperatu re
27860,10,1,white because the darker the lid color the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar because darker colors absorb more energy
27861,10,1,dark gray it will keep the dog house inside warm in col d weather yet cool in hot weather
27862,10,2,white having white would make the inside temp cooler because in the experiment the jar with the white lid had the coolest average temperature of 42 deg c
27863,10,1,light gray light gray because when it is warm the dog will want to stay cool and when the weather is cold the dog will want to stay warm the results got higher and lower for example the first trial was 44 it increased by hte second trial
27864,10,0,black black is a darker coler if you were to were a white shirt apposed to a black one on a hot day you will be warmer in t he black shirt because it absorbs more energy
27865,10,0,white the color white because it wont attract as much energy or haet if it were darcker
27866,10,1,light gray this color might affect the dog house by maki ng it kind of cool and not so hot for the dog because it is not as dark a s black so it won't absorb a lot of energy but also it is not as light as white so it won't be too cold
27867,10,2,white it would affect the doghoused because white i s cooler than the dark colors the average for white was 42 while the average for black was 53
27868,10,1,white if the doghouse is somewhere warm it should be white to keep it as cool as possible inside the doghouse
27869,10,2,black the black paint would insulate the inside of the dog house and keep it warm the color black reflects heat in the exp eriment black had the highest average temperture of 53 deg over all the other tested colors
27870,10,1,light gray t way this color might affect the inside of t he doghouse by not being to hot because the darker the lid color the grea ter the increase in the air temperature amd because light gray is only 45 deg c
27871,10,1,white i would use white because it is the coolest color and it wont over heat the dog as bad unlike the other colors
27872,10,1,black if brandi and jerry chose black it would kee p the dog house the warmest out of the four colors
27873,10,1,white it would keep the dog dog house the coolest on the inside so it wouldnt get too hot where if you painted it black i t would get much warmer in there
27874,10,2,white i would use white to paint my dog house because it would make it colder inside for the dog in the experiment the white lens tested to stay the coldest inside the jar so the white paint on the dog house would make it so the dog house was colder for the dog
27875,10,1,dark gray they might want to choose dark gray because i t will make the doghouse not too hot as black and not too cold as white f or it will still obsorb heat and make the doghouse warm like the jar temp eratures stayed the same at 48 deg c after heated so the dog would stay more and obtain the same amount of temperature the whole time when heate d most likely and not have to change around to different temperatures
27876,10,2,white it will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler in it it showed it was 42 deg and thats cooler than a ll the other colors
27877,10,0,white the dog needs warmth
27878,10,0,black it will effect the dog house is by the color of the paint and the temperoture also it will effect it is because how dark is the paint
27879,10,1,black if it were to be cold outside the black on t he doghouse should make it warmer
27880,10,1,black the black would absorbe the most thermal energy causing the dog house to have a higher air tempature get warmer
27881,10,1,white white will make it so that the dog house will be cooler for the dog
27882,10,0,white the white color attracks less heat so that wa y the dog isn't to hot or to cold
27883,10,2,black the color black will affect the inside of the doghouse because the darker the color the greater the increase in air t emperature in the results of the hot lamp experiment the blacks air tem perature got the highest average with 53 deg c this is because dark co lors absorb more energy
27884,10,1,light gray light gray so the doghouse wont be so hot
27885,10,1,black well in cold temperatures like in the experiment you would want your dog to have a warm sleeping area so you would choose black in the winter because that color absorbs the most heat keeping the doghouse warm if it was the summer time you might want to used white or light gray to keep the house cool
27886,10,1,dark gray i would use dark grey because based of were i live its colder most of the year but its hot during summer so that way when the dog is inside during winter its warm and during summer its not too hot
27887,10,2,white white will keep the dog house cooler inside b ecause its the lightest brightest color up there and in the experiment it shows that the over all average of the black darkest color was 53 de grees c and the average color for the white lid was 42 degrees c therfor e making white the coldest color possible for the dog house
27888,10,2,black by painting the doghouse black brandi and jerry will be allowing more heat to be attracted to the doghouse the data table from the experiment proves this point because it shows that the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes while using the black lid was 53 deg c which is the highest average temperature of the four lid colors that were used in the experiment
27889,10,1,black black might effect the dog house by keeping i t warmer because black attacts heat it asorbs the heat
27890,10,2,light gray this way the inside of the doghouse won't be too hot or too cold the average temperature was 45 deg white would be too cold because the average temperature was 42 deg black would be to o hot because the average temperature was 53 deg
27891,10,1,white it will make it not as warm
27892,10,1,white beacuse white reflects the sun so it would st ay cooler
27893,10,1,white i chose white because its a very bright chee rful and an elegant color and the dog won't get really hot like he would in black or dark gray
27894,10,2,white i think that the best paint color for the dog house is white i picked this color because white doesnt affect the insid e of the house with a lot of heat so it would stay cool during the summe r time for a dog because if you paint it balck sense black attracts the sun it would attract more energy and have more of the hott sun going in the dog house
27895,10,2,light gray i chose light gray because if you put black i t might be too hot because the trials where the avergae was 53 deg c f or dark gray it may also get to hot hot because the average was 48 deg c light gray was 45 deg c and that just perfect it wont be to cold or to hot white may be to cold at 42 deg c
27896,10,2,white white's color of paint affect on the doghou se will be that the doghouse will take longer to heat up so in the summe r the dog will be able to stay cooler longer i know this because in th e experiment the white jar lid heated up the least of the four colors by atleast 2 deg c each trial
27897,10,2,black i chose black becuase that means the dog hous e would be warmer on the inside i know that because the average temperat ure of black after ten minutes is 53 degrees while the average temperatur e of white after ten minutes is 42 degrees
27898,10,2,white having a white doghouse would keep the inside mof the doghouse cooler the average tempature for the inside of the jar with the white lid was 42 deg while the inside of the jar with the bl ack lid was an average of 53 deg the dog house would be on average 11 deg cooler
27899,10,1,light gray since the darker colors were to hot and the l ighter colors were to cold the light gray was kind of the middle so the d og wont be to cold or to hot
27900,10,1,white you would choose white because instead of abs orbing the sun light like black paint the white paint reflects it which w ould make the dog house more cool
27901,10,2,white the color that would be best for the doghouse in the summer would be white in the experiment with the effects of colo r on temperature the black lid caused the greatest increase in temperatu re rising from 24 deg c to an average of 53 deg c but the white lid caused the least increase in temperature rising from 24 deg c to only 42 deg c so if brandi and jerry want to keep the inside of the doghou se cool in the summer they should choose to paint the outside of the dog house white as it provides the least increase in temperature
27902,10,2,white a white dog house would make it cooler inside from the data the average temperature for white was 42 deg c which was cooler then the other colors
27903,10,2,white it will effect the dog house by absorbing les s heat energy keeping the dog house cool evidence frome the table states the average temp for white is 42 celsius
27904,10,1,white i think they should paint the dog house white because when there is a dark color such as black it will absorbe the he at so its best to use white so it wont be as hot in the dog house
27905,10,2,white the color white will reflect more of the sunl ight wich will make the house a colder temperature white was the coldest temperature in the expirement its average was 42 deg wich was the lowe st temperature and black had the highest temperature wich was 53 deg as an average
27906,10,1,white well if they were trying to make the doghou se nice and cool they should use white the color white reflects everythin g off of it making it a perfect doghouse to stay cool in it blocks about 30 more heat than a black dog house
27907,10,0,white the white light will make the dog house have light in it
27908,10,0,black i think black becuase it was the highest numb er on the average it was 53
27909,10,2,light gray brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse li ght gray light gray will keep the doghouse not too warm but not too cold in the experiment the light gray lid let in an average of 45 deg c th e black lid let in an average of 53 deg c the least heat let in was the white lid with an average of 42 deg c if i chose the white lid the do g might be too cold inside his house with black paint the dog could be too hot inside his house
27910,10,2,light gray the best color for a doghouse might be light gray because it wouldnt be to cold and it wouldn't be to hot in the data it shows that the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45 deg c and the others were 53 48 and 42 deg c
27911,10,0,light gray i like that color so i chose that color
27912,10,1,dark gray dark grey because black is probably to hot an d white is probably to cold but dark grey is right in the middle it wil l keep the dog warm
27913,10,2,light gray this color was the in between color or middl e color it was not the hottest nor coldest it had a pretty good balance so for trial 1 it was 44 deg c for trial 2 it was 45 deg c for 3 it w as 46 deg c and for trial 4 it was back to 45 deg c this is the best c olor since it will keep the dog warm but not too warm and not to cold e ither
27914,10,1,dark gray i think the bes color would be dark gray because its not the darkest and the darkest color absorbes more heat its not the lightest so it wont be very cold
27915,10,1,white this color might affect the inside of the dog house because in jerry and brandi's experiment white was proved to be t he coolest in degrees color versus black because the black lid attract ed more light
27916,10,0,white reduced tempertures
27917,10,1,light gray i chose the color light grey because with sun the temperature inside the dog house will be around 45 deg and t hat is not to hot and not to cold for the dog
27918,10,2,white white is the best color for the dog house bec ause dark colors absorb more energy than light colors with white paint i nside the dog house it's going to be cool and cold rather than with dark color paint inside the dog house it's going to be hot in the experiment dark color lids attraked more heat and the air was hotter than with the light color lids thats why white color paint will be a better color for t he dog house so it stays cooler
27919,10,1,white it willbe cooler then the other colors for th e dog house
27920,10,1,light gray light gray might keep the dog house warm in t he winter yet cool in the summer because in the expiriment light gray att rects heat but not alot of heat
27921,10,1,white well since the color is light gray instead of dark gray or black it wont absorb as much heat making a cool place to stay on a hot summer day if it was light gray it wouldent be so ba d etheir but white sounded like the best option thses facts are true because the experiment s hows that a black lid did absorb more heat while the others not so much
27922,10,1,dark gray a dark gray might make the inside of th e dog house hot because darker colors absorb more heat energy that woul d keep the dog house warmer at night so thats why i picked dark gray i a lso pick it because it will not absorb to much energy
27923,10,1,white white doghouse would be nice and cool in it
27924,10,1,white because the color white reflects thelight and heat better in order to keep the doghouse cool it should be painted whi te this will make the doghouse cooler inside especially during the summ er
27925,10,1,light gray brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse li ght grey because then the lightness of the doghouse would keep the temp erature down and then tint of darkness would keep it mildly warm
27926,10,1,white it would reflect the heat and keep the inside cool
27927,10,1,white the white color will make the doghouse cooler in the summer by reflecting the light
27928,10,0,dark gray i think that brandi and jerry should use the dark gray paint because that way the inside of the dog house is cool for the dog when its hot outside unlike the three other paint colors that will attract the sun and make it hot inside the dog house and also the dog wont have troubles sleeping because the light wont really reflect into the dog house to bother the dog while trying to sleep
27929,10,1,white white is the lightest color there fore it wil l attract the least amount of heat
27930,10,1,white white has more energy its cooler and black and all the other colors are darker then white the darker colors are closer together so they do not let as much light in
27931,10,1,light gray the color ''light gray'' would be good for th e dog house because when it is hot the doghouse wont be that hot inside other than blak nd drack gray
27932,10,1,white if it is white then the dog house will stay c ooler and the dog wont over heat
27933,10,1,light gray because they probably dont want it to be to hot or to cold so if they use dark gray then it would be perfect not to cold not to hot for the dog the temp would have an average temp of 45 deg not to hot not to cold
27934,10,1,dark gray if brandi and jerry choose dark gray for thei r dog house then the dog house would be a little bit cooler than a black dog house but won't be cold like a white dog house therefore the dog wou ld be comfortable being in a cool but at the same time warm doghouse
27935,10,0,white dog houses are to protect and shade the dog a nd white does not attract heat
27936,10,2,white a white painted doghouse would make the inter nal temperture cooler because as the experiment has shown the average in ternal air temperture of the jar with a white lid was 42 deg while the other lids caused average tempertures ranging from 45 deg 53 deg
27937,10,2,black painting a doghouse black would help heat the house from the experiment black made the air temperature rise th e most
27938,10,1,white the color white might affect the doghouse bec uase during summer months it will not absorb as much ehat energy as a bla ck doghouse would although in the winter months you will want more of th at energy abosrb so it is suggested to repaint the doghouse during the wi nter months
27939,10,0,white because white doesnt absorb heat because its not an dark color
27940,10,1,light gray light grey paint would keep the doghouse a mu tual temprature with a light grey colored paint on the doghouse the hou se wouldnt be to hot on a sunny day like a darker color would make it an d on a cold day the dog house wouldnt be to cold with a light grey paint
27941,10,2,white this color will make the doghouse cooler so t he dog will be more comfortable in the hot sun according to the experime nt the white colored lid had the coolest of temperatures out of all the 4 lids it was 42 deg in the white lid for trial one and 54 deg for th e black lid on trial one
27942,10,1,black choosing the color black will affect the dogh ouse because dark colors absorb more energy
27943,10,1,dark gray i would paint the dog house dark gray this w ay the dog house is warm in the winter but not to hot in the summer
27944,10,1,dark gray the color dark gray would affect the tempature of the doghouse because as the data shows a darker color results in hotter tempatures the data shows that the average temature was 53 deg c for black which would be to hot for a dog house the dark gray however had a lower tempature of 48 deg c which would be the correct tempature to keep a dog warm but not hot
27945,10,1,dark gray if it's a hot day the dog house won't get too hot and if it's a cold day the dog house wont get too cold the average tempature for the jar with the dark gray lid under the lamp is 45 deg c
27946,10,2,white this color wouldnt make it as hot inside the dog house as painting it black because as it shows in this experiment darker colors get hot faster the black heated up to 53 deg and the white only heated up to 42 deg
27947,10,2,light gray the color light gray might affect the doghous e by balancing out the temperature of the air outside or around the dogho use this also might be the most comforatable temp for the dog since in brandi amp jerri's investigation after being placed under a lamp for 1 0 minutes the air temperature inside of the light gray lid jar was 45 deg rees celcius while the other colored lid jars temperatures in degrees ce lsius were white 42 dark gray 48 amp black 53 so a light gray dogho use would be 8 degrees celsius cooler then a black doghouse in which i wo uld assume to be a more comforatable temperature
27948,10,2,light gray i think that light grey would be a good color for a doghouse because this color would make the doghouse not too hot an d not too cold according to the lid experiment light grey had averaging tempertures of 44 46 compared to the black average of 52 54 and the white average of 41 43 the averages for the light grey lid are moderately coo l which would be a good choice for a dog so they don't overheat or freeze
27949,10,1,white white would be the less warm when the sun or heat is shining directly at it than any other choice
27950,10,2,black brandi and jerry should paint the dog house b lack because the dog house will be warmer the the other colors cause blac k will absorb the sun most accordding to the data if you paint the doghouse black it will be warmer then if you paint it white because blac k got an average of 53 deg and white got an average of 42 deg so the re for black will be best color if you want it to be warm inside
27951,10,1,white the lighter the color the less heat that col or will attract absorb
27952,10,2,white white will keep the inside of the dog house c ooler the average temperature for white was 42 deg c after 10 min utes which is 3 less degrees than the second coolest color grey at 45 deg c
27953,10,0,white because the others takes in the light more th an the white paint
27954,10,1,white white would have a lower temperature inside t he doghouse making it nice and cool for the dog
27955,10,2,white if you chose to paint the doghouse white than it would be cool inside for your dog to rest in cool off on hot summer d ays white would decrease the temperature of the dog house because in the air temperature experiment the color black the darkest lid had the h ighest avg temperature inside of the glass jar which was 53 c the lightest color of lid white had t he lowest avg temperature inside of the glass jar and it was 42 c the difference between the dark lid black and the light lid white wa s 11 c so therefore the lighter the color in this case white will attra ct the least amount of sun resulting in a low temperature
27956,10,1,white if brandi and jerry painted the doghouse whit e then the light would reflect off he dog house if they ppainted it bla ck then the light would be absorbed and it would get very hot inside and if temperature gets hot enough possibly even burn or catch on fire
27957,10,2,light gray the white may be best because it is the colle st color tempurature as shown in the chart and will make sure the dog does not get overheated while in the house
27958,10,1,light gray light gray willl be the best color because it wil absorb some heat but also keep the dog from getting to hot in the su mmer the temperture where around 45 deg c which is good for a dog
27959,10,1,white that color will absorb the least amount of li ght keeping the dog house cooler
27960,10,2,white white will keep your dog house cooler on the inside rather than using a dark color like black because that will attrac t more heat
27961,10,2,dark gray the color dark grey would be the best color to paint the dog house the color dark grey will affect the inside of the dog house by making it warmer but not as hot as the black i know this because the average of the black in the experiment is 53 deg c and the average temperature for dark grey is 48 deg c
27962,10,2,black black might effect the dog house because in t he chart black has the highest temperature of all colors
27963,10,2,white using white paint for the doghouse will keep it cooler in the experiment the jar with the black lid had an average t emperature of 53 deg c and the jar with the white lid had an average tem perature of 42 deg c the jar with the white lid was an average of 11 deg c cooler than the jar with the black lid
27964,10,1,light gray light grey would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer but will also will absorb more light than white so it will b e warmer in the winter
27965,10,1,white white would be a good color to paint the dog house because in the trials white had the cooler temperature
27966,10,1,dark gray i would choose light gray because it would keep the dog nice and cool during day and warm at night also depends on where they live
27967,10,1,black black would make the inside of the doghouse w arm because the darker colors abosorbs the heat from the sunlight so if brandi and jerry used the color black for the lid of the glass jar then t he lid would absorb more of the heat from the bulb if brandi and jerry u sed the color white for the lid then the lid wouldn't absorb much of the heat from the bulb
27968,10,2,black it will keep the house warmer in the winter the balck lid had a average temperature of 53 deg c and the dark gray ha d the average of 48 deg c the light gray had an average of 45 deg c an d the white had an average of 42 deg c therefor the black colored roof is the best
27969,10,2,black black being the color of the doghouse might affect it by making it warmer higher temperature because it absorbs more light energy in the results the temperature was 53 deg c while with the white lid was only 42 deg c showing that black resulted in the highest temperature was the warmest
27970,10,1,light gray it would make it so it's not too hot but not too cold either
27971,10,0,dark gray the best paint for it will be the dark gray b ecause darker colors absorb more energy
27972,10,1,white white would change the temperature inside the doghouse because the lighter the color or the darker the color the coole r or hotter the air will be inside the doghouse so if the doghouse was w hite the air temperature will be cooler than the black air temperature do ghouse i know that dogs like cooler air better than hotter air
27973,10,1,light gray if it is black then it will get hotter insine un like gray it wont
27974,10,2,white if brandi and jerry were to paint the dog hou se white it would keep it cooler when they did the lid experment the a verage for the darker lid was highest 53 deg c if they were to paint the dog house a darker color it would become hotter quicker the average for the white paint was 42 deg c so it proves that painting the dog hou se a lighter color will keep it cooler
27975,10,1,dark gray i think dark gray is the best coler because i n the winter it will not be so cold because it will get some of the sun a nd heat up and also in the summer it would not be so hot from the sun s o the dog could always be in his her dog house any time of year
27976,10,2,black the black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors of paint the average temperature o f the glass jar with the black lid was 53 deg c the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid was 42 deg c the jar with the blac k paint was 11 deg c warmer than the jar with the white lid
27977,10,0,black if they were to choose black for their paint color they would find that the dog house would attract more heat because thats what darker colors do attract heat
27978,10,2,white they should use the color white because the c olor white doesnt attract heat very well so therefore it would keep it co oler inside of the dog house the results show that in all the trials whi te was in the low 40's and all the other colors like light grey an d black were in the high 40's and low 50's therefore the dog house would be cooler with white paint
27979,10,1,black using black with attract more sun and it woul d be hotter inside the doghouse and hot to touch so unless you like it wa rm i would light gray
27980,10,2,white i think white because the inside will be cool er as shown in the experiment the white lid's highest temperature in the experiment was 43 deg where as the blacks highest temperature was 54 deg which proves the white is cooler
27981,10,2,white i choose white this mite affect the dog hous e by making cooler in hot weather i choose this because in the experimen t white had the coolest temperature
27982,10,2,white if brandi and jerry pianted the dog house whi te then in the sun light the dog house will stay to an average of about 40 45 deg c because the color white deflects the sun light away off of t he dog house
27983,10,1,white it will stay cool and if it was black it woul d be to hot for the dog
27984,10,2,black the darker the color the warmer the dog house is going to be beacuse dark colors obsorbe more light then other colors
27985,10,2,white this color would be good for a dog because if the dog needs to cool off the white color attracks less heat i know thi s because the average temperature for black was 53 deg for dark gray i t was 48 deg for light gray it was 45 deg and for white it was 42 deg therefore white attracks less heat
27986,10,1,dark gray i would chose dark gray because in the summer it would be nice and cool and in the winter it wouldnt freez the avrege temp is 48 deg though out all the trials
27987,10,0,white because not absorb much energy this color
27988,10,2,white brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse white because the affect on the doghouse is that the color white will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler then if brandi and jerry painted the doghouse black this is because black absorbs more energy causing the inside of the doghouse to be warmer and white reflects energy light so it'l l keep the inside of the doghouse cooler from the experiment when a black lid was used the tempature inside the glass jar was 48 deg c but wh en a white lid was used the tempature inside the glass jar was 42 deg c so as you can see the lighter the color of the lid the cooler the tempature inside the glass jar will be and the darker the color of the lid the warmer the tempature inside the glass jar will be
27989,10,0,light gray because it had 5 more then dark gray
27990,10,1,light gray i chose light gray because the inside of the doghouse will not be too hot or too cold if light gray was chosen i learned in brandi and jerry's expirament that the darker the color of the lid was the warmer the air temperature inside the jar was after 10 minutes if the dog house was light gray the dog will be comfortably warm
27991,10,0,white it wil keep the sun from hitting him
27992,10,1,white thay should choose white becuse it attracts l ess heat so the dog can stay cooler
27993,10,1,black it will absorb heat because blackabsorbs heat
27994,10,2,white they should choose white because according to the data the white had the lowest temperature average of 42 deg c and i t was the lighest color if they chose black the dog house would be too h ot i know this because black has the highest temerature average 53 deg c
27995,10,2,white because hot and the black made the jar 53 25 deg on average while the white only made it 42 deg on average making white th e better choice
27996,10,1,white it would absorbe less heat so the dog would b e cooler than with black paint
27997,10,1,black the averagre air temp in the jar was 53 deg
27998,10,2,white the color white is the best paint color for t he doghouse because it will keep the inside of the doghouse cool white a veraged at 42 deg c after 10minutes while black was 53 deg c proving t hat the white color paint will keep the doghouse cooler
27999,10,2,black black would be the best color if brandi and jerry lived in a cold area because black obsorbs heat more than any other color according to thier experiment the black lid had the highest temperature
28000,10,2,black black paint would keep the inside of the dogh ouse warm black was 11 deg 8 deg and 5 deg more than the white lig ht gray and dark gray paints
28001,10,0,black the color black attrackeds more thermal energ y than the other colors
28002,10,1,light gray i chose light gray because the doghouse would be a little warm and a little fresh therefore the dog wouldnt be as hot on a sunny day or as cold on a rainy day
28003,10,1,white this color will affect the dog house because it will keep it cool when it's hot outside instead of being really hot in side of the dog's house because it stays the coolest
28004,10,1,light gray so it wont be too cool or too hot
28005,10,1,light gray if you are gonna paint a doghouse paint it light gray because the results of the experement show that the darker the color the higher the tempature and you dont want it to hot but you want it a little warm so you would paint it light gray
28006,10,1,white white will keep the doghouse cooler and your dog get overheated and sick
28007,10,1,light gray the dog house would be cold but for the dog w hich would have fur it would be warm and refreshingly cold so it would no t freeze and it would not over heat
28008,10,1,white black will make the doghouse warmer because b lack attracts the light
28009,10,1,black it would make the doghouse much warmer as see n in the jar experiment
28010,10,1,white it whould be cooler inside the doghouse
28011,10,1,dark gray the dark grey paint would keep the doghouse w arm when it's cold out but not as hot as the black paint when it's warm out the dark grey paint got the inside of a glass jar to 48 deg i n direct light in just ten minutes so it should keep the doghouse at a reasonable temperature
28012,10,0,white white reflects the suns rays
28013,10,2,white since dogs have fur they dont need to be any warmer so they should paint the dog house a lighter color the black color was 53 deg c and the white was 42 deg c making the white coloe le ss likely to become hot
28014,10,2,black in the data table it shows the black paint wi ll keep the doghouse the warmest because black obsorbs more sunlight than dark gray light gray or white paint
28015,10,1,black the color black will effect the dog house mor e because of the more energy it observes the tempeture goes higher
28016,10,1,white the doghouse would be build to cool off the dog so if you paint the doghouse white then the doghouse would absorb less heat therefore keeping the dog cooled off
28017,10,2,white white would be a good color for the dog house because a dog can get very hot during the summer so the inside of the do ghouse will stay cool in the experiment the white colored lid had an ave rage temperature of 42 deg c when the black lid had an average temperatu re of 53 deg c also out of the 4 colores the air in the glass jar with the white lid was the coolest
28018,10,2,black black would obsorb the heat and keep the dog house warm in the experiment in trial one the temperature was 54 deg c c ompared to the color white wich was 42 deg c the temperature was a big j ump from black and white
28019,10,2,white it will keep the dog cooler because it was th e least warmest in the jar
28020,10,1,white if they paint the dog house white it would s tay cooler compaired to the black
28021,10,2,white having white paint would make the dog house c older so in the summer the dog would not be hot the average for white is the coolest tempature 42 deg
28022,10,2,light gray i think that light gray is a good color becau se when it's sunny and hot outside the darker colors will make the dogho use very warm and most likely uncomfortable for the dog i didn't choose white because although it's not a huge difference light gray was still a little bit warmer than white without being too hot
28023,10,2,light gray the inside wont be hot and it wont be very co ld either the light gray average temperature had an average of 45 deg c unlike the black lid which got hotter and had an average temperature of 53 deg c
28024,10,1,light gray i think that the best color to paint the dog house would be light gray because if you paint it black or dark gray then in the summer it will get too hot inside the dog house but if you paint it white then it will get too cold in the dog house in the winter so i t hink that light gray is the perfect color to paint the dog house
28025,10,2,black based on the results in the experiment if the y painted the doghouse black it would keep the air temeture inside the do ghouse the highest wich would keep the dog the warmest
28026,10,1,white if the doghouse is white the doghouse will be cooler on the inside and therefore much more comfortable on the inside
28027,10,1,dark gray the black color might affect the doghouse in a good way because it will keep the doghouse warm when it is sunny outside and the dog won't be cold it will be warm
28028,10,2,white brandi and jerry should paint the the doghous e the color white this color will affect the inside of the dogh ouse because it will absorb less heat and make the inside of the doghouse cooler than if you use a dark color becaue light colors absorb less ener gy evidence from brandi and jerry's hot lamp exp eriment showed that the darker the color of the lid the warmer the air i nside the jar was so if they plan to have a living animal insid e in this case a dog i think it'd be more comfortable if the doghouse w asn't hot they should paint the dog house white
28029,10,1,white white is the best choose for the dog house be cause it will stay cooler the the other color
28030,10,2,black brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse bl ack because in the data table they got results which showed for trial one they got 54 deg trial two 52 deg trial three 54 deg and the adv erage they got was 53 deg so they should paint the doghouse black beca use it will stay warmer inside because the sun is attracted to the color black
28031,10,0,white i think it wont affect the doghouse because i t is white and i dont think it well attract the sun as much as the black color well
28032,10,2,white if you design a white doghouse the chances ar e that the doghouse would be more cooler then the black dark gray light gray doghouses because the darker the color the more energy it will absor b see beacause when they did the experiment the black lid absorbed more energy then all the others because of it's drak color and the white lid absorbed less energy then the others because it's lighter color
28033,10,2,black if brandi and jerry painted their dog house black it would absorb more energy from the sun and be warmer inside i know this because in their experiment the jar with the black lid had the highest air temperature the average temperature of the jar with the black lid was 53 deg c which is higher than the dark gray 48 deg c the light gray 45 deg c and the white 42 deg c
28034,10,1,black the black paint would affect the doghouse be cause it would absorb heat and insulate the doghouse making it hot
28035,10,2,light gray brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse li ght gray because in the summer time it will keep the inside of the doghou se cooler then the black and dark grey but a little warmer then the white
28036,10,2,black useing the black color for the dog house will make the dog house warmer because on the data of the lid color vs air tempature inside glass jar the black lid made the jar 11 degrees warmer than the white jar at 42 deg s so therefore the doghouse will be warmer with the black paint
28037,10,0,black black because in the experiment it shows that black keeps heat in more
28038,10,2,white the best paint color for the doghouse would b e white in the experiment white had an average of 42 deg c wich wus the lowest temperature out of the four colors white would keep the doghouse cool
28039,10,1,light gray light grey so it disn't get too hot in the su mer and not too cold in the winter
28040,10,2,black black would probubly affect the doghouse because it would absorb more heat plus the experiment shows that black kept in the most heat
28041,10,2,white white is the best color because in the expera ment the white colored lid was the least one to atrack heat and was the l owest in tempeture
28042,10,2,white if they paint the doghouse white then the tem peratrure inside will be alot cooloer becuase the white lid was 11 deg cooler than the jar with the black lid therefore painting the doho use white would keep the dog nice and cool
28043,10,2,black it would affect the doghouse by always keeping it warm because black has more pigment in it so it absorbs the light more and in the investigation the average for black was 53 the highest out of the rest so thats my prove that it would make it warmer hot
28044,10,1,white if you use white the tem in the dog house wou ld be less
28045,10,1,white the inside of the dog house wont be so hot be cause white paint wouldnt absorb alot of heat energy
28046,10,2,dark gray the inside of the dog house would be moderatl y warm with dark gray at 48 deg c black would make it hot at 50 deg c light gray would make it cool at 45 deg c and white would keep it cold at 42 deg c
28047,10,1,dark gray i believe that the doghouse should be dark gray because not only the temperature from the experiment but also the suitable conditions for a dog according to the data the average temperature is at 48 deg c while the color black is at 53 deg c for a dog to live in a doghouse the temperature shouldn't be too hot or too cold
28048,10,2,dark gray if the color is dark grey for the doghouse th an it would keep the dog warmer during harsh weather yet not too warm for very warm seasons in the investigation hot lamp the lid color that inc reased the inside temperature the most was the black colored lid with an average temperature of 53 deg c however the second highest was the dar k grey lid with an average of 48 deg c so the dark grey roof would be the perfect color for the house to keep the dog at a comfortable temper ture
28049,10,1,black because the darker the lid color the grea ter the increase in the air temperature in the glass jar
28050,10,1,dark gray the best paint color would be dark gray becau se it keeps heat inside the dog house because of the color and when its w arm out it wont be too hot to stay in for the dog
28051,10,2,black i believe that the best color for the doghous e is black this color may affect the inside of the doghouse by increasin g its temprature therefore the dog can stay warm i know this is true b ecause the average heat in the experiment for black was 53 degrees while the average temprature with white for example was 42 degrees clearly black would be the best color for the doghouse
28052,10,1,white white would be a good color for the doghouse because the white will not absorb heat and the dog will have cool place t o go during the summer or hot days
28053,10,1,light gray light gray because it is not that hot o r that cold and it has a okay average
28054,10,2,white white is the best choice because when they did the test with the lamp the white lid was the coolest with an average t emperature of 42 deg c the black lid was 53 deg c the dark gray lid w as 48 deg c and the light gray lid was 45 deg c if they use black as the doghouse colour then the dog might get to hot if he she stays in there to long if they use dark gray for the dog house then he will have more time to get out of the dog house before heating up but he still can heat up if they use light gray for the colour of the dog house then the dog will still have more time to get out of the dog house than if the used black or dark gray but he still has the chance of over heating if they use white as the dog house colour then the dog will have the most amount of time to get out before he she over heats
28055,10,1,dark gray if they chose dark grey the average temperat ure would be 48 deg which is normal so the dog house wouldnt be so hot for the dog but cozy and not as cold either
28056,10,0,light gray i would go with the light gray because gray k eeps heat in but not to much heat and gray lets the cold air out when its cold out side
28057,10,1,light gray u waant one that will keep u worm in the winter but cool in the summer
28058,10,1,white brandi and jerry should paint the dog house w hite because than the dog can stay cooler in the summer time
28059,10,1,white if they use white paint for the doghouse the house won't be too hot for the dog because during the experiment they found out that the darker the color the more energy it absorbes
28060,10,0,white the color is going to effect the dog house by makeing the house fresh because dark colors consume more tempeture
28061,10,2,black the color might affect the dog house because the darker the color is the warmer the dog house would be in the experim ent hot lamp the darker the lid was the warmer the air got inside the ja r when the lid was black the tempature was at 53 deg c and when the w hite lid was on the tempature decreased to 42 deg c
28062,10,2,white white because the white gets less heat than t he other colors black got an average of 53 deg c the dark gray got an average of 48 deg c and light gray got an average of 45 deg c but the white got an average of 42 deg c so it should be white
28063,10,1,white it white because white would keep the dog hou se coler than all the other coior
28064,10,0,dark gray the color might affect the inside of the dog house because the average temperature is 48 deg c and in trial 1 2 a nd 3 the temperature was 48 deg c also
28065,10,2,black a black dog house will hold heat better than anyother color i know this because in the lid experiment black's air temp ature had the highest average out of dark grey light grey and white
28066,10,1,black black is the best at capturing and keeping he at its average heat was 53
28067,10,1,black with a darker color during the winter the dog wouldn't be as cold with black the average tempreture would be 53 deg c the diffrence between white and black was 12 deg c hotter in the black jar then the white jar
28068,10,2,white white would effect the inside of the dog hous e because white clearly kept the air temperature inside of the glass jar in the experiment cooler than black dark gray or light gray the averag e temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 deg c while the avera ge for the black lid was 53 deg c that is a difference of 11 deg alt hough the dark gray lid and the light gray lid didn't have such an extrem e difference from the white lid the dark and light gray lid still rose t he air temperature quite a lot from the starting temperature which was 24 deg c also on average the black lid rose the air temperature in the gl ass container 29 deg c from the starting temperature while the white lid only rose the air temperature 18 deg c from the starting temperature on average that is a difference of agian 11 deg c
28069,10,1,white if brandi and jerry use white the dog house wont be as hot or higher temperature because white attracts the least a mount of heat
28070,10,2,white i think that white would be the color because according to the experiment white had the lowest temperature so the dog s wouldn't get to hot
28071,10,0,black it will give it more air and light for the dog
28072,10,1,white it might affect it because the darker the col or the hotter it is
28073,10,0,light gray i chose light gray because say its a really c old day outside and your dog is inside his doghouse ill bet hes really happy that you didnt chose to paint it white instead
28074,10,1,light gray if you choose cark grey the inside of the dar k house wont be to warm or to cold when you used black it had an average of 53 degrees because the darkness is absorbing all of the heat the whi te on the other hand is 42 degrees adn isnt absorbing as much of the warm ness you would nt want the doghouse to be to warm or to hot so if you ch ose light the dog could have a perfect tempeture becasue he already has a thick fur line keeping him warm and we would want him to become so war m and become faint so light gray wch collects 42 degrees on an avergae i s better
28075,10,1,white i chose white because the color white does not absorb as much heat as black so the white would keep the dog cooled when it is hot
28076,10,0,light gray they liked it becuse they like dog house's
28077,10,1,black if brandi and jerry increased the darker the doghouse black then the doghouse will be a lot hotter because the darker the dog house the more energy is absorbed
28078,10,2,white based on the data white will make the dog house cooler light colors don't absorb as much heat as dark colors in conclusion white would be the best color for the hot weather
28079,10,2,black acorrding the expirement the black lid on th e jar caused the temperature inside the jar to be higher therefore makin g a black painted doghouse have warmer temperatures than other colors
28080,10,2,light gray light gray is the best color for a doghouse b ecause a black dog house is too hot for the dog being 53 deg c on avera ge the white doghouse would be too cold from only having 42 deg c insid e the only options left are dark gray and light gray but with the heat coming off from the dog itself more heat will circulate around the doghouse therefore light gray with 45 deg c on average would be a better color to paint a doghouse than dark gray with 48 deg c on average
28081,10,1,white if it is white then the air in the dog house will stay cool on hot days
28082,10,2,white they should use white because the average tem perature of white was 42 deg c and the average temp of black was 53 deg c therefore the color white would keep the dog coolest
28083,10,2,dark gray a dark gray dog house would keep the doghouse warm but not too hot in the sun in the experiment the jar with the dark gray lid didn't have the hottest or the coldest air inside
28084,10,0,white le color se be mas bonito que los otros
28085,10,1,white the color white will keep away the heat on ho t summer days keeping the doghouse cool
28086,10,1,dark gray the color dark gray will affect the doghouse by making the doghouse warm not too hot in the summer and not too cold i n the winter the data table on lid color vs air temperature insid e glass jar says that the average temperature for dark gray lid is 48 deg c this shows that it is a good temperature for most weather
28087,10,1,white this will make the doghouse the coolest becas ue it's average data was only 42 degrees c this will keep the dog the co olest during the summer time
28088,10,0,black the color of the doghouse being black will be st maintain heat during cold seasons or periods of time during the hotte r seasons the dog occupying the house will have no need of the doghouse thus overheating is not an issue
28089,10,0,black black is not a good color bacause it exstract s heat from the sun and and the trials for black are 54 52 54 53 and that s why they should not choose the color black
28090,10,2,white white will keep the inside of the dog house colder during the summer or when its hot outside the average for white is 42 deg instead of black being 53 deg
28091,10,0,white because it will keep you more warmer
28092,10,1,white white would make the dog house colder
28093,10,1,white the color white would be the best for the dog house because white absorbs the least energy and would keep the doghouse cool and comfortable
28094,10,1,light gray the light gray color will keep a maintained normal temperature
28095,10,1,white i would paint it white so on a hot summer day brandi and jerry's dog could cool down
28096,10,1,black this color will affects the doghouse internal temperature the darkness of the color will absorb heat energy and keep the inside of this dog house warm
28097,10,0,black becues is black
28098,10,2,white the white paint would make the doghouse coole r the black paint would make the doghouse warmer at 53 degrees celicus t he white paint would be 42degrees celcius
28099,10,1,white it will make the dog house cool for the dog o n hot days
28100,10,1,black beacuse it can be warm inside the dog house i f the sun hits the black paint it can be hot in there and change the temp ature
28101,10,0,black el negro por que el negro consume el calor y el blanco no
28102,10,1,white white would be the best color because the tem perature in the inside of the dog house would be colder than any other co lor
28103,10,2,white the dog house should be painted white because it would make the dog house the coolest coldest since dogs like the s hade and cold to cool them down in the summer white would reflect the mo st light energy and prevent it from becoming too hot after ten min utes the jar with the black lid heated up by 29 degrees c on average ho wever the jar with the white lid didn't heat up at all on average
28104,10,1,black having a black doghouse will b warmer
28105,10,1,white white is the best color because it keeps it v ery cool lighter colores like white reflex the sun lite that makes it mo re cool and darker coolors like black absord that makes it more hot
28106,10,1,light gray i picked light gray becuase i thought i didnt want the dog to be to hot in there by having it black or dark gray but t hen again i didnt want the dig to have white just in case he wont get to cold so i picked light gray so he she will feel just right
28107,10,2,white i would choose white colored paint because the dog house would be cooler according to the results in the expiriment where black was for the first trial 54 deg c then for the last trial also 54 deg c where as white at its first trial got 42 deg c and 41 deg c for its last trial
28108,10,2,light gray since the doghouse will have a living being in it the temperature should be comfortable for the dog 53 deg c is very very warm and would make a dog uncomfortable especially on a warm su mmer day but 41 deg c is too cold for a dog in the winter time as this would be a year round house for the dog so 45 deg c would be less hot in the summer and more warm in the winter which is just perfect for the dog
28109,10,1,white it wont exorb that much heat so it will cool insiode the dog house
28110,10,2,white white will keep the doghouse at a cooler temp erature than any of the other colors will thus preventing the dog from o ver heating this is proven by the fact that after ten minutes a jar wit h a white lid had an increased temperature of 18 deg c while jars with darker lids ranging from light gray to black had an increase in tempera ture of anywhere from 21 deg c to 29 deg c the white lid kept the jar cooler so it will keep the doghouse cooler as well this is healthier fo r the dog
28111,10,1,black the color black would effect the air tempature of the dog house because in the scenario it says darker colors absorbe more energy
28112,10,0,black if you painted the outside of a dog house th en the inside would be warmer no matter what color you painted the insid e
28113,10,0,white white would be the best color to chose for th e doghouse because white reflects off the sun it doesnt absorb it like black dark grey or grey
28114,10,1,dark gray the best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because its close to median of the data also the average temperature for dark gray is 48 deg c this shows that the color can a bsorb and reflect light so in cold days the doghouse will stay warm and on hot days the temperature inside the doghouse will be cooler
28115,10,0,dark gray it will keep the temperature the same at all times
28116,10,2,white the white paint would help keep the dog house cooler when it is hot out from the experiment the white lid was the co olest out of all four lids
28117,10,1,white white will keep the doghouse cool becuase it reflects light instead of absorbing it
28118,10,2,white white will make the dog house cooler on the inside unlike black white had a average of 42 deg c and black was 53 deg c
28119,10,2,light gray light gray was the color i would have chosen for the inside of the doghouse because since black absorbs the most ener gy and the inside would have been hot dark gray would have done the same thing as black but just not as much energy would have been absorbed lig ht gray would have been a perfect color not only absorbing the perfect a mount of the light the inside would not have been as hot as the colors b lack and dark grey
28120,10,2,light gray as shown in experiment that brandi and jerry conducted we learned that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs knowing this we wouldn't want the dog to get overheated so we would panint the dog house the lightest color available which in this case is white though the dog being a live creature shouldn't get too cold therefore light gray is the perfect compromise keeping the dog wa rm enough but not too hot
28121,10,1,black this color black could affect the doghouse b ecause the dog could get very hot in the summer time also the doghouse might get extremely hot from the sun and start to erode
28122,10,1,dark gray i chose dark gray because it stayed the same heat every trial so it wouldnt be to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter
28123,10,2,white durring the experiment brandi and jerry foun d out that white was the color that least affected the air temperature in the jar when a lamp was directed toward it if the white color was paint ed apon the top of the dog house then the temperature wouldnt rise as mu ch as the black coored paint because jerry and brandi made there experim ent and got the results of white having the least affected air temperatur e when a lamp is directed at the jar for example on trial 1 the white container had an air temperature of 42 deg c versis the air temperature in the black jar of 54 deg c
28124,10,1,light gray its cool but it gets some heat for the dog
28125,10,1,white its going to be cooler for the dog in the ins ide than the darker colors because they do absorb more energy and that wi ll make the doghouse very hot in the inside
28126,10,1,light gray light gray could affect the inside of the dog house cause the color is not to dark so that it wont be to hot and its n ot to light so it wont be to cold the temperature will be just fine
28127,10,2,white it will keep the doghouse cooler than any of the other colors becuase it stayed in a termperature of low 40 deg c li ght gray was in high mid 40 deg c dark gray in high 40 deg c and blac k was in low 50 deg c proving that lighter colors keep the air temperatu re cooler
28128,10,2,light gray i picked dark gray because in the experiment it resulted having darker colors absorbs some heat so that means lighter colors help reflect light gray helps absorb heat in the winter just a l ittle and in the some helps reflect a good amount
28129,10,2,black they should make the dog house black so that it will keep the dog warmer in the winter becuase more heat will be absorbed the black lid was an average of 5 deg warmer then the second warmest color so the dog will stay nice and warm inside the dog house
28130,10,1,light gray the tempature of the dog house would be from 44 deg c to 46 deg c the dog house will be at a neutral condition beca use it will not be too hot or too cold
28131,10,1,light gray i choose dark gray because the light grey is perfect say that its a could wet day the dog is really could the dog cou ld go into the dog house and stay warm with out being over welmed with he at from his body and fur the color's averge tempurture was 48 degrees ce lceas it keeps most of the temp in but leaving some out also it gragulla y was getting warm at a slow pace wich would help the dog alot when it ge ts to summer time so he dosnt get over heated buy the suns heat
28132,10,1,dark gray dark gray is better because it will get hotte r in the doghouse but not too hot
28133,10,1,white the heat would be less atracted to white than the rest of the colours
28134,10,1,white it wont make it as hot it'll make it cooler
